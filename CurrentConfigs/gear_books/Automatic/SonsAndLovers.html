 <h3>
 THE EARLY MARRIED LIFE OF THE MORELS
 </h3>
 <p>
 "THE BOTTOMS" succeeded to "Hell Row". Hell Row was a block of thatched,
 bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane. There
 lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away. The
 brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small mines,
 whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a
 circle round a gin. And all over the countryside were these same pits,
 some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II, the few colliers
 and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth, making queer
 mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and the meadows. And
 the cottages of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs here and there,
 together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers, straying over the
 parish, formed the village of Bestwood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place, gin-pits were
 elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers. The coal and iron
 field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered. Carston, Waite and
 Co. appeared. Amid tremendous excitement, Lord Palmerston formally opened
 the company's first mine at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood Forest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing old had
 acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirt was cleansed
 away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Carston, Waite &amp; Co. found they had struck on a good thing, so, down
 the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk,
 until soon there were six pits working. From Nuttall, high up on the
 sandstone among the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the
 Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to
 Minton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands
 of the valleyside to Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running north
 to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of
 Derbyshire: six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a
 loop of fine chain, the railway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co. built the
 Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood, and
 then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row, they erected the
 Bottoms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings, two rows of
 three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve houses in a block.
 This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope
 from Bestwood, and looked out, from the attic windows at least, on the
 slow climb of the valley towards Selby.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The houses themselves were substantial and very decent. One could walk all
 round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the
 shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny top
 block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet hedges,
 and dormer windows for the attics. But that was outside; that was the view
 on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers' wives. The
 dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing inward
 between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at the
 ash-pits. And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits, went
 the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the men
 smoked. So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that was so
 well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because people
 must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley
 of ash-pits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which was already
 twelve years old and on the downward path, when she descended to it from
 Bestwood. But it was the best she could do. Moreover, she had an end house
 in one of the top blocks, and thus had only one neighbour; on the other
 side an extra strip of garden. And, having an end house, she enjoyed a
 kind of aristocracy among the other women of the "between" houses, because
 her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week.
 But this superiority in station was not much consolation to Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years. A rather
 small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she shrank a little
 from the first contact with the Bottoms women. She came down in the July,
 and in the September expected her third baby.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her husband was a miner. They had only been in their new home three weeks
 when the wakes, or fair, began. Morel, she knew, was sure to make a
 holiday of it. He went off early on the Monday morning, the day of the
 fair. The two children were highly excited. William, a boy of seven, fled
 off immediately after breakfast, to prowl round the wakes ground, leaving
 Annie, who was only five, to whine all morning to go also. Mrs. Morel did
 her work. She scarcely knew her neighbours yet, and knew no one with whom
 to trust the little girl. So she promised to take her to the wakes after
 dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William appeared at half-past twelve. He was a very active lad,
 fair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I have my dinner, mother?" he cried, rushing in with his cap on.
 "'Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can have your dinner as soon as it's done," replied the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it done?" he cried, his blue eyes staring at her in indignation.
 "Then I'm goin' be-out it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll do nothing of the sort. It will be done in five minutes. It is
 only half-past twelve."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'll be beginnin'," the boy half cried, half shouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You won't die if they do," said the mother. "Besides, it's only half-past
 twelve, so you've a full hour."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat down.
 They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy jumped off his chair
 and stood perfectly stiff. Some distance away could be heard the first
 small braying of a merry-go-round, and the tooting of a horn. His face
 quivered as he looked at his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told you!" he said, running to the dresser for his cap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take your pudding in your hand?and it's only five past one, so you
 were wrong?you haven't got your twopence," cried the mother in a
 breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then went off
 without a word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want to go, I want to go," said Annie, beginning to cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!" said the
 mother. And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall
 hedge with her child. The hay was gathered from the fields, and cattle
 were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses, one
 going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding,
 and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the
 cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the
 peep-show lady. The mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the
 Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a
 negro and maimed for life two white men. She left him alone, and went to
 get Annie a spin of toffee. Presently the lad stood in front of her,
 wildly excited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You never said you was coming?isn't the' a lot of things??that
 lion's killed three men?I've spent my tuppence?an' look here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses on them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marbles in them
 holes. An' I got these two in two goes-'aepenny a go-they've got
 moss-roses on, look here. I wanted these."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She knew he wanted them for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!" she said, pleased. "They ARE pretty!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall you carry 'em, 'cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 'em?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her about the ground,
 showed her everything. Then, at the peep-show, she explained the pictures,
 in a sort of story, to which he listened as if spellbound. He would not
 leave her. All the time he stuck close to her, bristling with a small
 boy's pride of her. For no other woman looked such a lady as she did, in
 her little black bonnet and her cloak. She smiled when she saw women she
 knew. When she was tired she said to her son:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, are you coming now, or later?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you goin' a'ready?" he cried, his face full of reproach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Already? It is past four, I know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you goin' a'ready for?" he lamented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You needn't come if you don't want," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her son stood
 watching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unable to leave the
 wakes. As she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars she
 heard men shouting, and smelled the beer, and hurried a little, thinking
 her husband was probably in the bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale, and
 somewhat wretched. He was miserable, though he did not know it, because he
 had let her go alone. Since she had gone, he had not enjoyed his wakes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has my dad been?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's helping to wait at the Moon and Stars. I seed him through that black
 tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his sleeves rolled up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha!" exclaimed the mother shortly. "He's got no money. An' he'll be
 satisfied if he gets his 'lowance, whether they give him more or not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more to sew, she
 rose and went to the door. Everywhere was the sound of excitement, the
 restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her. She went out into
 the side garden. Women were coming home from the wakes, the children
 hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse. Occasionally a
 man lurched past, almost as full as he could carry. Sometimes a good
 husband came along with his family, peacefully. But usually the women and
 children were alone. The stay-at-home mothers stood gossiping at the
 corners of the alley, as the twilight sank, folding their arms under their
 white aprons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel was alone, but she was used to it. Her son and her little girl
 slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind her, fixed and
 stable. But she felt wretched with the coming child. The world seemed a
 dreary place, where nothing else would happen for her?at least until
 William grew up. But for herself, nothing but this dreary endurance?till
 the children grew up. And the children! She could not afford to have this
 third. She did not want it. The father was serving beer in a public house,
 swilling himself drunk. She despised him, and was tied to him. This coming
 child was too much for her. If it were not for William and Annie, she was
 sick of it, the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out, yet
 unable to stay indoors. The heat suffocated her. And looking ahead, the
 prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge. There she stood,
 trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading,
 beautiful evening. Opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill,
 under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures. The sky
 overhead throbbed and pulsed with light. The glow sank quickly off the
 field; the earth and the hedges smoked dusk. As it grew dark, a ruddy
 glare came out on the hilltop, and out of the glare the diminished
 commotion of the fair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the
 hedges, men came lurching home. One young man lapsed into a run down the
 steep bit that ended the hill, and went with a crash into the stile. Mrs.
 Morel shuddered. He picked himself up, swearing viciously, rather
 pathetically, as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter. She was
 beginning by now to realise that they would not. She seemed so far away
 from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily
 up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater
 at Sheerness ten years before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What have I to do with it?" she said to herself. "What have I to do with
 all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn't seem as if I were
 taken into account."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accomplishes
 one's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it were slurred
 over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wait," Mrs. Morel said to herself?"I wait, and what I wait for
 can never come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire, looked
 out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak. After which she sat
 down to her sewing. Through the long hours her needle flashed regularly
 through the stuff. Occasionally she sighed, moving to relieve herself. And
 all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had, for
 the children's sakes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At half-past eleven her husband came. His cheeks were very red and very
 shiny above his black moustache. His head nodded slightly. He was pleased
 with himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin 'elpin' Anthony, an' what's think
 he's gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae'f-crown, an' that's ivry penny?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He thinks you've made the rest up in beer," she said shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' I 'aven't?that I 'aven't. You b'lieve me, I've 'ad very little
 this day, I have an' all." His voice went tender. "Here, an' I browt thee
 a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th' children." He laid the
 gingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object, on the table. "Nay, tha
 niver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life, did ter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As a compromise, she picked up the cocoanut and shook it, to see if it had
 any milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a good 'un, you may back yer life o' that. I got it fra' Bill
 Hodgkisson. 'Bill,' I says, 'tha non wants them three nuts, does ter?
 Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I ham,
 Walter, my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An' so I took
 one, an' thanked 'im. I didn't like ter shake it afore 'is eyes, but 'e
 says, 'Tha'd better ma'e sure it's a good un, Walt.' An' so, yer see, I
 knowed it was. He's a nice chap, is Bill Hodgkisson, e's a nice chap!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A man will part with anything so long as he's drunk, and you're drunk
 along with him," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?" said
 Morel. He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day's
 helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bed as quickly as
 possible, while he raked the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independents who had
 fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who remained stout Congregationalists.
 Her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lace-market at a time when so
 many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham. Her father, George
 Coppard, was an engineer?a large, handsome, haughty man, proud of
 his fair skin and blue eyes, but more proud still of his integrity.
 Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build. But her temper, proud
 and unyielding, she had from the Coppards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty. He became foreman
 of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness. Mrs. Morel?Gertrude?was
 the second daughter. She favoured her mother, loved her mother best of
 all; but she had the Coppards' clear, defiant blue eyes and their broad
 brow. She remembered to have hated her father's overbearing manner towards
 her gentle, humorous, kindly-souled mother. She remembered running over
 the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat. She remembered to have
 been petted and flattered by all the men when she had gone to the
 dockyard, for she was a delicate, rather proud child. She remembered the
 funny old mistress, whose assistant she had become, whom she had loved to
 help in the private school. And she still had the Bible that John Field
 had given her. She used to walk home from chapel with John Field when she
 was nineteen. He was the son of a well-to-do tradesman, had been to
 college in London, and was to devote himself to business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon, when they
 had sat under the vine at the back of her father's house. The sun came
 through the chinks of the vine-leaves and made beautiful patterns, like a
 lace scarf, falling on her and on him. Some of the leaves were clean
 yellow, like yellow flat flowers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now sit still," he had cried. "Now your hair, I don't know what it IS
 like! It's as bright as copper and gold, as red as burnt copper, and it
 has gold threads where the sun shines on it. Fancy their saying it's
 brown. Your mother calls it mouse-colour."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had met his brilliant eyes, but her clear face scarcely showed the
 elation which rose within her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you say you don't like business," she pursued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't. I hate it!" he cried hotly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you would like to go into the ministry," she half implored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should. I should love it, if I thought I could make a first-rate
 preacher."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then why don't you?why DON'T you?" Her voice rang with defiance.
 "If I were a man, nothing would stop me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She held her head erect. He was rather timid before her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But my father's so stiff-necked. He means to put me into the business,
 and I know he'll do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if you're a MAN?" she had cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Being a man isn't everything," he replied, frowning with puzzled
 helplessness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, as she moved about her work at the Bottoms, with some experience of
 what being a man meant, she knew that it was NOT everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At twenty, owing to her health, she had left Sheerness. Her father had
 retired home to Nottingham. John Field's father had been ruined; the son
 had gone as a teacher in Norwood. She did not hear of him until, two years
 later, she made determined inquiry. He had married his landlady, a woman
 of forty, a widow with property.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And still Mrs. Morel preserved John Field's Bible. She did not now believe
 him to be?Well, she understood pretty well what he might or might
 not have been. So she preserved his Bible, and kept his memory intact in
 her heart, for her own sake. To her dying day, for thirty-five years, she
 did not speak of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a Christmas party, a
 young man from the Erewash Valley. Morel was then twenty-seven years old.
 He was well set-up, erect, and very smart. He had wavy black hair that
 shone again, and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved. His
 cheeks were ruddy, and his red, moist mouth was noticeable because he
 laughed so often and so heartily. He had that rare thing, a rich, ringing
 laugh. Gertrude Coppard had watched him, fascinated. He was so full of
 colour and animation, his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque, he was
 so ready and so pleasant with everybody. Her own father had a rich fund of
 humour, but it was satiric. This man's was different: soft,
 non-intellectual, warm, a kind of gambolling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She herself was opposite. She had a curious, receptive mind which found
 much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk. She was clever in
 leading folk to talk. She loved ideas, and was considered very
 intellectual. What she liked most of all was an argument on religion or
 philosophy or politics with some educated man. This she did not often
 enjoy. So she always had people tell her about themselves, finding her
 pleasure so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and
 dropping bunches of brown silk curls. Her blue eyes were very straight,
 honest, and searching. She had the beautiful hands of the Coppards. Her
 dress was always subdued. She wore dark blue silk, with a peculiar silver
 chain of silver scallops. This, and a heavy brooch of twisted gold, was
 her only ornament. She was still perfectly intact, deeply religious, and
 full of beautiful candour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Walter Morel seemed melted away before her. She was to the miner that
 thing of mystery and fascination, a lady. When she spoke to him, it was
 with a southern pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled him
 to hear. She watched him. He danced well, as if it were natural and joyous
 in him to dance. His grandfather was a French refugee who had married an
 English barmaid?if it had been a marriage. Gertrude Coppard watched
 the young miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like glamour in
 his movement, and his face the flower of his body, ruddy, with tumbled
 black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above. She
 thought him rather wonderful, never having met anyone like him. Her father
 was to her the type of all men. And George Coppard, proud in his bearing,
 handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred theology in reading, and who
 drew near in sympathy only to one man, the Apostle Paul; who was harsh in
 government, and in familiarity ironic; who ignored all sensuous pleasure:?he
 was very different from the miner. Gertrude herself was rather
 contemptuous of dancing; she had not the slightest inclination towards
 that accomplishment, and had never learned even a Roger de Coverley. She
 was puritan, like her father, high-minded, and really stern. Therefore the
 dusky, golden softness of this man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed
 off his flesh like the flame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into
 incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was, seemed to her
 something wonderful, beyond her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came and bowed above her. A warmth radiated through her as if she had
 drunk wine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now do come and have this one wi' me," he said caressively. "It's easy,
 you know. I'm pining to see you dance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had told him before she could not dance. She glanced at his humility
 and smiled. Her smile was very beautiful. It moved the man so that he
 forgot everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I won't dance," she said softly. Her words came clean and ringing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not knowing what he was doing?he often did the right thing by
 instinct?he sat beside her, inclining reverentially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you mustn't miss your dance," she reproved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, I don't want to dance that?it's not one as I care about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet you invited me to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laughed very heartily at this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never thought o' that. Tha'rt not long in taking the curl out of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was her turn to laugh quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it," he laughed,
 rather boisterously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you are a miner!" she exclaimed in surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I went down when I was ten."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him in wondering dismay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You soon get used to it. You live like th' mice, an' you pop out at night
 to see what's going on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It makes me feel blind," she frowned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like a moudiwarp!" he laughed. "Yi, an' there's some chaps as does go
 round like moudiwarps." He thrust his face forward in the blind,
 snout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff and peer for direction. "They
 dun though!" he protested naively. "Tha niver seed such a way they get in.
 But tha mun let me ta'e thee down some time, an' tha can see for thysen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him, startled. This was a new tract of life suddenly opened
 before her. She realised the life of the miners, hundreds of them toiling
 below earth and coming up at evening. He seemed to her noble. He risked
 his life daily, and with gaiety. She looked at him, with a touch of appeal
 in her pure humility.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shouldn't ter like it?" he asked tenderly. "'Appen not, it 'ud dirty
 thee."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had never been "thee'd" and "thou'd" before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next Christmas they were married, and for three months she was
 perfectly happy: for six months she was very happy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of a tee-totaller: he
 was nothing if not showy. They lived, she thought, in his own house. It
 was small, but convenient enough, and quite nicely furnished, with solid,
 worthy stuff that suited her honest soul. The women, her neighbours, were
 rather foreign to her, and Morel's mother and sisters were apt to sneer at
 her ladylike ways. But she could perfectly well live by herself, so long
 as she had her husband close.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes, when she herself wearied of love-talk, she tried to open her
 heart seriously to him. She saw him listen deferentially, but without
 understanding. This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy, and she had
 flashes of fear. Sometimes he was restless of an evening: it was not
 enough for him just to be near her, she realised. She was glad when he set
 himself to little jobs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a remarkably handy man?could make or mend anything. So she
 would say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do like that coal-rake of your mother's?it is small and natty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make thee one!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! why, it's a steel one!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' what if it is! Tha s'lt ha'e one very similar, if not exactly same."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise. He was busy and
 happy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But in the seventh month, when she was brushing his Sunday coat, she felt
 papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden curiosity, took
 them out to read. He very rarely wore the frock-coat he was married in:
 and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the
 papers. They were the bills of the household furniture, still unpaid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here," she said at night, after he was washed and had had his
 dinner. "I found these in the pocket of your wedding-coat. Haven't you
 settled the bills yet?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I haven't had a chance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you told me all was paid. I had better go into Nottingham on Saturday
 and settle them. I don't like sitting on another man's chairs and eating
 from an unpaid table."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can have your bank-book, can't I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought?" she began. He had told her he had a good bit of money
 left over. But she realised it was no use asking questions. She sat rigid
 with bitterness and indignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day she went down to see his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I did," tartly retorted the elder woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how much did he give you to pay for it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elder woman was stung with fine indignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin'," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't help that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where has it all gone?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look?beside ten pound
 as he owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Six pounds!" echoed Gertrude Morel. It seemed to her monstrous that,
 after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding, six pounds more
 should have been squandered in eating and drinking at Walter's parents'
 house, at his expense.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how much has he sunk in his houses?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His houses?which houses?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gertrude Morel went white to the lips. He had told her the house he lived
 in, and the next one, was his own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought the house we live in?" she began.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're my houses, those two," said the mother-in-law. "And not clear
 either. It's as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest paid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gertrude sat white and silent. She was her father now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then we ought to be paying you rent," she said coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Walter is paying me rent," replied the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what rent?" asked Gertrude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Six and six a week," retorted the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was more than the house was worth. Gertrude held her head erect, looked
 straight before her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is lucky to be you," said the elder woman, bitingly, "to have a
 husband as takes all the worry of the money, and leaves you a free hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young wife was silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She said very little to her husband, but her manner had changed towards
 him. Something in her proud, honourable soul had crystallised out hard as
 rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When October came in, she thought only of Christmas. Two years ago, at
 Christmas, she had met him. Last Christmas she had married him. This
 Christmas she would bear him a child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?" asked her nearest neighbour,
 in October, when there was great talk of opening a dancing-class over the
 Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?I never had the least inclination to," Mrs. Morel replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester. You know he's
 quite a famous one for dancing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't know he was famous," laughed Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yea, he is though! Why, he ran that dancing-class in the Miners' Arms
 club-room for over five year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he did." The other woman was defiant. "An' it was thronged every
 Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat'day?an' there WAS carryin's-on,
 accordin' to all accounts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs. Morel, and she had a
 fair share of it. The women did not spare her, at first; for she was
 superior, though she could not help it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He began to be rather late in coming home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're working very late now, aren't they?" she said to her
 washer-woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No later than they allers do, I don't think. But they stop to have their
 pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you are! Dinner stone
 cold?an' it serves 'em right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Mr. Morel does not take any drink."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs. Morel, then went on with her
 work, saying nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born. Morel was good to her,
 as good as gold. But she felt very lonely, miles away from her own people.
 She felt lonely with him now, and his presence only made it more intense.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy was small and frail at first, but he came on quickly. He was a
 beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blue eyes which changed
 gradually to a clear grey. His mother loved him passionately. He came just
 when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear; when her faith
 in life was shaken, and her soul felt dreary and lonely. She made much of
 the child, and the father was jealous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last Mrs. Morel despised her husband. She turned to the child; she
 turned from the father. He had begun to neglect her; the novelty of his
 own home was gone. He had no grit, she said bitterly to herself. What he
 felt just at the minute, that was all to him. He could not abide by
 anything. There was nothing at the back of all his show.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There began a battle between the husband and wife?a fearful, bloody
 battle that ended only with the death of one. She fought to make him
 undertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfill his obligations.
 But he was too different from her. His nature was purely sensuous, and she
 strove to make him moral, religious. She tried to force him to face
 things. He could not endure it?it drove him out of his mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had become so irritable
 that it was not to be trusted. The child had only to give a little trouble
 when the man began to bully. A little more, and the hard hands of the
 collier hit the baby. Then Mrs. Morel loathed her husband, loathed him for
 days; and he went out and drank; and she cared very little what he did.
 Only, on his return, she scathed him with her satire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The estrangement between them caused him, knowingly or unknowingly,
 grossly to offend her where he would not have done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William was only one year old, and his mother was proud of him, he was so
 pretty. She was not well off now, but her sisters kept the boy in clothes.
 Then, with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather, and his
 white coat, he was a joy to her, the twining wisps of hair clustering
 round his head. Mrs. Morel lay listening, one Sunday morning, to the
 chatter of the father and child downstairs. Then she dozed off. When she
 came downstairs, a great fire glowed in the grate, the room was hot, the
 breakfast was roughly laid, and seated in his armchair, against the
 chimney-piece, sat Morel, rather timid; and standing between his legs, the
 child?cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round poll?looking
 wondering at her; and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug, a
 myriad of crescent-shaped curls, like the petals of a marigold scattered
 in the reddening firelight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel stood still. It was her first baby. She went very white, and
 was unable to speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What dost think o' 'im?" Morel laughed uneasily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She gripped her two fists, lifted them, and came forward. Morel shrank
 back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I could kill you, I could!" she said. She choked with rage, her two fists
 uplifted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yer non want ter make a wench on 'im," Morel said, in a frightened tone,
 bending his head to shield his eyes from hers. His attempt at laughter had
 vanished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head of her child. She
 put her hands on his hair, and stroked and fondled his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?my boy!" she faltered. Her lip trembled, her face broke, and,
 snatching up the child, she buried her face in his shoulder and cried
 painfully. She was one of those women who cannot cry; whom it hurts as it
 hurts a man. It was like ripping something out of her, her sobbing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel sat with his elbows on his knees, his hands gripped together till
 the knuckles were white. He gazed in the fire, feeling almost stunned, as
 if he could not breathe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently she came to an end, soothed the child and cleared away the
 breakfast-table. She left the newspaper, littered with curls, spread upon
 the hearthrug. At last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back
 of the fire. She went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet.
 Morel was subdued. He crept about wretchedly, and his meals were a misery
 that day. She spoke to him civilly, and never alluded to what he had done.
 But he felt something final had happened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Afterwards she said she had been silly, that the boy's hair would have had
 to be cut, sooner or later. In the end, she even brought herself to say to
 her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did. But she
 knew, and Morel knew, that that act had caused something momentous to take
 place in her soul. She remembered the scene all her life, as one in which
 she had suffered the most intensely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her
 love for Morel. Before, while she had striven against him bitterly, she
 had fretted after him, as if he had gone astray from her. Now she ceased
 to fret for his love: he was an outsider to her. This made life much more
 bearable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nevertheless, she still continued to strive with him. She still had her
 high moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans. It was now a
 religious instinct, and she was almost a fanatic with him, because she
 loved him, or had loved him. If he sinned, she tortured him. If he drank,
 and lied, was often a poltroon, sometimes a knave, she wielded the lash
 unmercifully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The pity was, she was too much his opposite. She could not be content with
 the little he might be; she would have him the much that he ought to be.
 So, in seeking to make him nobler than he could be, she destroyed him. She
 injured and hurt and scarred herself, but she lost none of her worth. She
 also had the children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners, and always
 beer, so that whilst his health was affected, it was never injured. The
 week-end was his chief carouse. He sat in the Miners' Arms until
 turning-out time every Friday, every Saturday, and every Sunday evening.
 On Monday and Tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten
 o'clock. Sometimes he stayed at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
 or was only out for an hour. He practically never had to miss work owing
 to his drinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But although he was very steady at work, his wages fell off. He was
 blab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger. Authority was hateful to him, therefore he
 could only abuse the pit-managers. He would say, in the Palmerston:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e says, 'You know,
 Walter, this 'ere'll not do. What about these props?' An' I says to him,
 'Why, what art talkin' about? What d'st mean about th' props?' 'It'll
 never do, this 'ere,' 'e says. 'You'll be havin' th' roof in, one o' these
 days.' An' I says, 'Tha'd better stan' on a bit o' clunch, then, an' hold
 it up wi' thy 'ead.' So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e swore, an'
 t'other chaps they did laugh." Morel was a good mimic. He imitated the
 manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good English.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'I shan't have it, Walter. Who knows more about it, me or you?' So I
 says, 'I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred. It'll 'appen carry
 thee ter bed an' back."'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions. And some of
 this would be true. The pit-manager was not an educated man. He had been a
 boy along with Morel, so that, while the two disliked each other, they
 more or less took each other for granted. But Alfred Charlesworth did not
 forgive the butty these public-house sayings. Consequently, although Morel
 was a good miner, sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he
 married, he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls, where the coal
 was thin, and hard to get, and unprofitable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Also, in summer, the pits are slack. Often, on bright sunny mornings, the
 men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven, or twelve o'clock. No
 empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth. The women on the hillside look across
 as they shake the hearthrug against the fence, and count the wagons the
 engine is taking along the line up the valley. And the children, as they
 come from school at dinner-time, looking down the fields and seeing the
 wheels on the headstocks standing, say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Minton's knocked off. My dad'll be at home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And there is a sort of shadow over all, women and children and men,
 because money will be short at the end of the week.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week, to provide
 everything?rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors.
 Occasionally, if he were flush, he gave her thirty-five. But these
 occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twenty-five. In
 winter, with a decent stall, the miner might earn fifty or fifty-five
 shillings a week. Then he was happy. On Friday night, Saturday, and
 Sunday, he spent royally, getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts. And
 out of so much, he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought
 them a pound of apples. It all went in drink. In the bad times, matters
 were more worrying, but he was not so often drunk, so that Mrs. Morel used
 to say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he's flush, there isn't
 a minute of peace."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If he earned forty shillings he kept ten; from thirty-five he kept five;
 from thirty-two he kept four; from twenty-eight he kept three; from
 twenty-four he kept two; from twenty he kept one-and-six; from eighteen he
 kept a shilling; from sixteen he kept sixpence. He never saved a penny,
 and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving; instead, she had
 occasionally to pay his debts; not public-house debts, for those never
 were passed on to the women, but debts when he had bought a canary, or a
 fancy walking-stick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs. Morel was trying to
 save against her confinement. So it galled her bitterly to think he should
 be out taking his pleasure and spending money, whilst she remained at
 home, harassed. There were two days' holiday. On the Tuesday morning Morel
 rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before six o'clock, she
 heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of
 whistling, lively and musical. He nearly always whistled hymns. He had
 been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell
 cathedral. His morning whistling alone betrayed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden, his whistling
 ringing out as he sawed and hammered away. It always gave her a sense of
 warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed, the children not yet
 awake, in the bright early morning, happy in his man's fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting
 playing on the sofa, and the mother was washing up, he came in from his
 carpentry, his sleeves rolled up, his waistcoat hanging open. He was still
 a good-looking man, with black, wavy hair, and a large black moustache.
 His face was perhaps too much inflamed, and there was about him a look
 almost of peevishness. But now he was jolly. He went straight to the sink
 where his wife was washing up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, are thee there!" he said boisterously. "Sluthe off an' let me wesh
 mysen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You may wait till I've finished," said his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This good-humoured threat amused Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little 'ussy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With which he stood watching her a moment, then went away to wait for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant. Usually he
 preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck. Now, however, he made a
 toilet. There seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he
 washed himself, so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in
 the kitchen, and, bending because it was too low for him, scrupulously
 parted his wet black hair, that it irritated Mrs. Morel. He put on a
 turn-down collar, a black bow, and wore his Sunday tail-coat. As such, he
 looked spruce, and what his clothes would not do, his instinct for making
 the most of his good looks would.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal. Jerry was Morel's
 bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him. He was a tall, thin man, with a
 rather foxy face, the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes. He walked
 with a stiff, brittle dignity, as if his head were on a wooden spring. His
 nature was cold and shrewd. Generous where he intended to be generous, he
 seemed to be very fond of Morel, and more or less to take charge of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel hated him. She had known his wife, who had died of consumption,
 and who had, at the end, conceived such a violent dislike of her husband,
 that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage. None of which
 Jerry had seemed to mind. And now his eldest daughter, a girl of fifteen,
 kept a poor house for him, and looked after the two younger children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!" Mrs. Morel said of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've never known Jerry mean in MY life," protested Morel. "A
 opener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere, accordin' to
 my knowledge."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Open-handed to you," retorted Mrs. Morel. "But his fist is shut tight
 enough to his children, poor things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I should like to know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Mrs. Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The subject of argument was seen, craning his thin neck over the scullery
 curtain. He caught Mrs. Morel's eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mornin', missis! Mester in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?he is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway. He was not
 invited to sit down, but stood there, coolly asserting the rights of men
 and husbands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A nice day," he said to Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Grand out this morning?grand for a walk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you mean YOU'RE going for a walk?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. We mean walkin' to Nottingham," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however, full of
 assurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant in presence
 of his wife. But he laced his boots quickly, with spirit. They were going
 for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham. Climbing the hillside
 from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily into the morning. At the Moon and
 Stars they had their first drink, then on to the Old Spot. Then a long
 five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious pint of
 bitter. But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle
 was full, so that, when they came in sight of the city, Morel was sleepy.
 The town spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely in the midday glare,
 fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and
 chimneys. In the last field Morel lay down under an oak tree and slept
 soundly for over an hour. When he rose to go forward he felt queer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's sister, then repaired to
 the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitement of pigeon-racing. Morel
 never in his life played cards, considering them as having some occult,
 malevolent power?"the devil's pictures," he called them! But he was
 a master of skittles and of dominoes. He took a challenge from a Newark
 man, on skittles. All the men in the old, long bar took sides, betting
 either one way or the other. Morel took off his coat. Jerry held the hat
 containing the money. The men at the tables watched. Some stood with their
 mugs in their hands. Morel felt his big wooden ball carefully, then
 launched it. He played havoc among the nine-pins, and won half a crown,
 which restored him to solvency.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By seven o'clock the two were in good condition. They caught the 7.30
 train home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable. Every inhabitant remaining
 was out of doors. The women, in twos and threes, bareheaded and in white
 aprons, gossiped in the alley between the blocks. Men, having a rest
 between drinks, sat on their heels and talked. The place smelled stale;
 the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows, which
 were not more than two hundred yards away. The water ran quickly over
 stones and broken pots. Mother and child leaned on the rail of the old
 sheep-bridge, watching. Up at the dipping-hole, at the other end of the
 meadow, Mrs. Morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the
 deep yellow water, or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the
 blackish stagnant meadow. She knew William was at the dipping-hole, and it
 was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned. Annie played under
 the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she called currants. The
 child required much attention, and the flies were teasing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The children were put to bed at seven o'clock. Then she worked awhile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a load off their
 minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so they could put the
 finishing touches to a glorious day. They entered the Nelson with the
 satisfaction of returned travellers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damper on the
 men's spirits. Most of them, moreover, had spent their money. Some were
 already rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparation for the morrow.
 Mrs. Morel, listening to their mournful singing, went indoors. Nine
 o'clock passed, and ten, and still "the pair" had not returned. On a
 doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly, in a drawl: "Lead, kindly
 Light." Mrs. Morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they
 must sing that hymn when they got maudlin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As if 'Genevieve' weren't good enough," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob a
 large black saucepan steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel took a panchion, a great
 bowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom,
 and then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then Morel came in. He had been very jolly in the Nelson, but coming
 home had grown irritable. He had not quite got over the feeling of
 irritability and pain, after having slept on the ground when he was so
 hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house. He did not
 know he was angry. But when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open
 it, he kicked it and broke the latch. He entered just as Mrs. Morel was
 pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan. Swaying slightly, he
 lurched against the table. The boiling liquor pitched. Mrs. Morel started
 back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good gracious," she cried, "coming home in his drunkenness!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Comin' home in his what?" he snarled, his hat over his eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly her blood rose in a jet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say you're NOT drunk!" she flashed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had put down her saucepan, and was stirring the sugar into the beer.
 He dropped his two hands heavily on the table, and thrust his face
 forwards at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Say you're not drunk,'" he repeated. "Why, nobody but a nasty little
 bitch like you 'ud 'ave such a thought."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He thrust his face forward at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing," she replied. "And," she
 cried, flashing into sudden fury, "if you've been sponging on your beloved
 Jerry, why, let him look after his children, for they need it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie, it's a lie. Shut your face, woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were now at battle-pitch. Each forgot everything save the hatred of
 the other and the battle between them. She was fiery and furious as he.
 They went on till he called her a liar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe. "Don't call me that?you,
 the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe-leather." She forced the
 last words out of suffocated lungs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're a liar!" he yelled, banging the table with his fist. "You're a
 liar, you're a liar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stiffened herself, with clenched fists.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The house is filthy with you," she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then get out on it?it's mine. Get out on it!" he shouted. "It's me
 as brings th' money whoam, not thee. It's my house, not thine. Then ger
 out on't?ger out on't!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I would," she cried, suddenly shaken into tears of impotence. "Ah,
 wouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago, but for those children. Ay,
 haven't I repented not going years ago, when I'd only the one"?suddenly
 drying into rage. "Do you think it's for YOU I stop?do you think I'd
 stop one minute for YOU?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go, then," he shouted, beside himself. "Go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" She faced round. "No," she cried loudly, "you shan't have it ALL
 your own way; you shan't do ALL you like. I've got those children to see
 to. My word," she laughed, "I should look well to leave them to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go," he cried thickly, lifting his fist. He was afraid of her. "Go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should be only too glad. I should laugh, laugh, my lord, if I could get
 away from you," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came up to her, his red face, with its bloodshot eyes, thrust forward,
 and gripped her arms. She cried in fear of him, struggled to be free.
 Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushed her roughly to the outer
 door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt behind her with a bang. Then
 he went back into the kitchen, dropped into his armchair, his head,
 bursting full of blood, sinking between his knees. Thus he dipped
 gradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The moon was high and magnificent in the August night. Mrs. Morel, seared
 with passion, shivered to find herself out there in a great white light,
 that fell cold on her, and gave a shock to her inflamed soul. She stood
 for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb
 leaves near the door. Then she got the air into her breast. She walked
 down the garden path, trembling in every limb, while the child boiled
 within her. For a while she could not control her consciousness;
 mechanically she went over the last scene, then over it again, certain
 phrases, certain moments coming each time like a brand red-hot down on her
 soul; and each time she enacted again the past hour, each time the brand
 came down at the same points, till the mark was burnt in, and the pain
 burnt out, and at last she came to herself. She must have been half an
 hour in this delirious condition. Then the presence of the night came
 again to her. She glanced round in fear. She had wandered to the side
 garden, where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant
 bushes under the long wall. The garden was a narrow strip, bounded from
 the road, that cut transversely between the blocks, by a thick thorn
 hedge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She hurried out of the side garden to the front, where she could stand as
 if in an immense gulf of white light, the moon streaming high in face of
 her, the moonlight standing up from the hills in front, and filling the
 valley where the Bottoms crouched, almost blindingly. There, panting and
 half weeping in reaction from the stress, she murmured to herself over and
 over again: "The nuisance! the nuisance!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She became aware of something about her. With an effort she roused herself
 to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness. The tall white
 lilies were reeling in the moonlight, and the air was charged with their
 perfume, as with a presence. Mrs. Morel gasped slightly in fear. She
 touched the big, pallid flowers on their petals, then shivered. They
 seemed to be stretching in the moonlight. She put her hand into one white
 bin: the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight. She bent down
 to look at the binful of yellow pollen; but it only appeared dusky. Then
 she drank a deep draught of the scent. It almost made her dizzy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel leaned on the garden gate, looking out, and she lost herself
 awhile. She did not know what she thought. Except for a slight feeling of
 sickness, and her consciousness in the child, herself melted out like
 scent into the shiny, pale air. After a time the child, too, melted with
 her in the mixing-pot of moonlight, and she rested with the hills and
 lilies and houses, all swum together in a kind of swoon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she came to herself she was tired for sleep. Languidly she looked
 about her; the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen;
 a moth ricochetted over them, and right across the garden. Following it
 with her eye roused her. A few whiffs of the raw, strong scent of phlox
 invigorated her. She passed along the path, hesitating at the white
 rose-bush. It smelled sweet and simple. She touched the white ruffles of
 the roses. Their fresh scent and cool, soft leaves reminded her of the
 morning-time and sunshine. She was very fond of them. But she was tired,
 and wanted to sleep. In the mysterious out-of-doors she felt forlorn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no noise anywhere. Evidently the children had not been wakened,
 or had gone to sleep again. A train, three miles away, roared across the
 valley. The night was very large, and very strange, stretching its hoary
 distances infinitely. And out of the silver-grey fog of darkness came
 sounds vague and hoarse: a corncrake not far off, sound of a train like a
 sigh, and distant shouts of men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again, she hurried down the
 side garden to the back of the house. Softly she lifted the latch; the
 door was still bolted, and hard against her. She rapped gently, waited,
 then rapped again. She must not rouse the children, nor the neighbours. He
 must be asleep, and he would not wake easily. Her heart began to burn to
 be indoors. She clung to the door-handle. Now it was cold; she would take
 a chill, and in her present condition!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Putting her apron over her head and her arms, she hurried again to the
 side garden, to the window of the kitchen. Leaning on the sill, she could
 just see, under the blind, her husband's arms spread out on the table, and
 his black head on the board. He was sleeping with his face lying on the
 table. Something in his attitude made her feel tired of things. The lamp
 was burning smokily; she could tell by the copper colour of the light. She
 tapped at the window more and more noisily. Almost it seemed as if the
 glass would break. Still he did not wake up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After vain efforts, she began to shiver, partly from contact with the
 stone, and from exhaustion. Fearful always for the unborn child, she
 wondered what she could do for warmth. She went down to the coal-house,
 where there was an old hearthrug she had carried out for the rag-man the
 day before. This she wrapped over her shoulders. It was warm, if grimy.
 Then she walked up and down the garden path, peeping every now and then
 under the blind, knocking, and telling herself that in the end the very
 strain of his position must wake him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, after about an hour, she rapped long and low at the window.
 Gradually the sound penetrated to him. When, in despair, she had ceased to
 tap, she saw him stir, then lift his face blindly. The labouring of his
 heart hurt him into consciousness. She rapped imperatively at the window.
 He started awake. Instantly she saw his fists set and his eyes glare. He
 had not a grain of physical fear. If it had been twenty burglars, he would
 have gone blindly for them. He glared round, bewildered, but prepared to
 fight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Open the door, Walter," she said coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His hands relaxed. It dawned on him what he had done. His head dropped,
 sullen and dogged. She saw him hurry to the door, heard the bolt chock. He
 tried the latch. It opened?and there stood the silver-grey night,
 fearful to him, after the tawny light of the lamp. He hurried back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Mrs. Morel entered, she saw him almost running through the door to
 the stairs. He had ripped his collar off his neck in his haste to be gone
 ere she came in, and there it lay with bursten button-holes. It made her
 angry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She warmed and soothed herself. In her weariness forgetting everything,
 she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done, set his
 breakfast, rinsed his pit-bottle, put his pit-clothes on the hearth to
 warm, set his pit-boots beside them, put him out a clean scarf and
 snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went to bed. He was already
 dead asleep. His narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of peevish
 misery into his forehead while his cheeks' down-strokes, and his sulky
 mouth, seemed to be saying: "I don't care who you are nor what you are, I
 SHALL have my own way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel knew him too well to look at him. As she unfastened her brooch
 at the mirror, she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared with the
 yellow dust of lilies. She brushed it off, and at last lay down. For some
 time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks, but she was asleep
 before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his drunkenness.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER II
 </h2>
 <h3>
 THE BIRTH OF PAUL, AND ANOTHER BATTLE
 </h3>
 <p>
 AFTER such a scene as the last, Walter Morel was for some days abashed and
 ashamed, but he soon regained his old bullying indifference. Yet there was
 a slight shrinking, a diminishing in his assurance. Physically even, he
 shrank, and his fine full presence waned. He never grew in the least
 stout, so that, as he sank from his erect, assertive bearing, his physique
 seemed to contract along with his pride and moral strength.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But now he realised how hard it was for his wife to drag about at her
 work, and, his sympathy quickened by penitence, hastened forward with his
 help. He came straight home from the pit, and stayed in at evening till
 Friday, and then he could not remain at home. But he was back again by ten
 o'clock, almost quite sober.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He always made his own breakfast. Being a man who rose early and had
 plenty of time he did not, as some miners do, drag his wife out of bed at
 six o'clock. At five, sometimes earlier, he woke, got straight out of bed,
 and went downstairs. When she could not sleep, his wife lay waiting for
 this time, as for a period of peace. The only real rest seemed to be when
 he was out of the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went downstairs in his shirt and then struggled into his pit-trousers,
 which were left on the hearth to warm all night. There was always a fire,
 because Mrs. Morel raked. And the first sound in the house was the bang,
 bang of the poker against the raker, as Morel smashed the remainder of the
 coal to make the kettle, which was filled and left on the hob, finally
 boil. His cup and knife and fork, all he wanted except just the food, was
 laid ready on the table on a newspaper. Then he got his breakfast, made
 the tea, packed the bottom of the doors with rugs to shut out the draught,
 piled a big fire, and sat down to an hour of joy. He toasted his bacon on
 a fork and caught the drops of fat on his bread; then he put the rasher on
 his thick slice of bread, and cut off chunks with a clasp-knife, poured
 his tea into his saucer, and was happy. With his family about, meals were
 never so pleasant. He loathed a fork: it is a modern introduction which
 has still scarcely reached common people. What Morel preferred was a
 clasp-knife. Then, in solitude, he ate and drank, often sitting, in cold
 weather, on a little stool with his back to the warm chimney-piece, his
 food on the fender, his cup on the hearth. And then he read the last
 night's newspaper?what of it he could?spelling it over
 laboriously. He preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even
 when it was daylight; it was the habit of the mine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At a quarter to six he rose, cut two thick slices of bread and butter, and
 put them in the white calico snap-bag. He filled his tin bottle with tea.
 Cold tea without milk or sugar was the drink he preferred for the pit.
 Then he pulled off his shirt, and put on his pit-singlet, a vest of thick
 flannel cut low round the neck, and with short sleeves like a chemise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he went upstairs to his wife with a cup of tea because she was ill,
 and because it occurred to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've brought thee a cup o' tea, lass," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you needn't, for you know I don't like it," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Drink it up; it'll pop thee off to sleep again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She accepted the tea. It pleased him to see her take it and sip it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll back my life there's no sugar in," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yi?there's one big 'un," he replied, injured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a wonder," she said, sipping again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had a winsome face when her hair was loose. He loved her to grumble at
 him in this manner. He looked at her again, and went, without any sort of
 leave-taking. He never took more than two slices of bread and butter to
 eat in the pit, so an apple or an orange was a treat to him. He always
 liked it when she put one out for him. He tied a scarf round his neck, put
 on his great, heavy boots, his coat, with the big pocket, that carried his
 snap-bag and his bottle of tea, and went forth into the fresh morning air,
 closing, without locking, the door behind him. He loved the early morning,
 and the walk across the fields. So he appeared at the pit-top, often with
 a stalk from the hedge between his teeth, which he chewed all day to keep
 his mouth moist, down the mine, feeling quite as happy as when he was in
 the field.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Later, when the time for the baby grew nearer, he would bustle round in
 his slovenly fashion, poking out the ashes, rubbing the fireplace,
 sweeping the house before he went to work. Then, feeling very
 self-righteous, he went upstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now I'm cleaned up for thee: tha's no 'casions ter stir a peg all day,
 but sit and read thy books."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Which made her laugh, in spite of her indignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And the dinner cooks itself?" she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, I know nowt about th' dinner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd know if there weren't any."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, 'appen so," he answered, departing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she got downstairs, she would find the house tidy, but dirty. She
 could not rest until she had thoroughly cleaned; so she went down to the
 ash-pit with her dustpan. Mrs. Kirk, spying her, would contrive to have to
 go to her own coal-place at that minute. Then, across the wooden fence,
 she would call:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you keep wagging on, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay," answered Mrs. Morel deprecatingly. "There's nothing else for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you seen Hose?" called a very small woman from across the road. It
 was Mrs. Anthony, a black-haired, strange little body, who always wore a
 brown velvet dress, tight fitting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I haven't," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, I wish he'd come. I've got a copperful of clothes, an' I'm sure I
 heered his bell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hark! He's at the end."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two women looked down the alley. At the end of the Bottoms a man stood
 in a sort of old-fashioned trap, bending over bundles of cream-coloured
 stuff; while a cluster of women held up their arms to him, some with
 bundles. Mrs. Anthony herself had a heap of creamy, undyed stockings
 hanging over her arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've done ten dozen this week," she said proudly to Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "T-t-t!" went the other. "I don't know how you can find time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh!" said Mrs. Anthony. "You can find time if you make time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know how you do it," said Mrs. Morel. "And how much shall you get
 for those many?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tuppence-ha'penny a dozen," replied the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mrs. Morel. "I'd starve before I'd sit down and seam
 twenty-four stockings for twopence ha'penny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't know," said Mrs. Anthony. "You can rip along with 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hose was coming along, ringing his bell. Women were waiting at the
 yard-ends with their seamed stockings hanging over their arms. The man, a
 common fellow, made jokes with them, tried to swindle them, and bullied
 them. Mrs. Morel went up her yard disdainfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was an understood thing that if one woman wanted her neighbour, she
 should put the poker in the fire and bang at the back of the fireplace,
 which, as the fires were back to back, would make a great noise in the
 adjoining house. One morning Mrs. Kirk, mixing a pudding, nearly started
 out of her skin as she heard the thud, thud, in her grate. With her hands
 all floury, she rushed to the fence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you knock, Mrs. Morel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you wouldn't mind, Mrs. Kirk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Kirk climbed on to her copper, got over the wall on to Mrs. Morel's
 copper, and ran in to her neighbour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, dear, how are you feeling?" she cried in concern.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You might fetch Mrs. Bower," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Kirk went into the yard, lifted up her strong, shrill voice, and
 called:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ag-gie?Ag-gie!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sound was heard from one end of the Bottoms to the other. At last
 Aggie came running up, and was sent for Mrs. Bower, whilst Mrs. Kirk left
 her pudding and stayed with her neighbour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel went to bed. Mrs. Kirk had Annie and William for dinner. Mrs.
 Bower, fat and waddling, bossed the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hash some cold meat up for the master's dinner, and make him an
 apple-charlotte pudding," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He may go without pudding this day," said Mrs. Bower.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottom of the
 pit, ready to come up. Some men were there before four o'clock, when the
 whistle blew loose-all; but Morel, whose stall, a poor one, was at this
 time about a mile and a half away from the bottom, worked usually till the
 first mate stopped, then he finished also. This day, however, the miner
 was sick of the work. At two o'clock he looked at his watch, by the light
 of the green candle?he was in a safe working?and again at
 half-past two. He was hewing at a piece of rock that was in the way for
 the next day's work. As he sat on his heels, or kneeled, giving hard blows
 with his pick, "Uszza?uszza!" he went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall ter finish, Sorry?" cried Barker, his fellow butty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Finish? Niver while the world stands!" growled Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he went on striking. He was tired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a heart-breaking job," said Barker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Morel was too exasperated, at the end of his tether, to answer. Still
 he struck and hacked with all his might.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha might as well leave it, Walter," said Barker. "It'll do to-morrow,
 without thee hackin' thy guts out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll lay no b?? finger on this to-morrow, Isr'el!" cried
 Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well, if tha wunna, somebody else'll ha'e to," said Israel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Morel continued to strike.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey-up there?LOOSE-A'!" cried the men, leaving the next stall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel continued to strike.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha'll happen catch me up," said Barker, departing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had gone, Morel, left alone, felt savage. He had not finished his
 job. He had overworked himself into a frenzy. Rising, wet with sweat, he
 threw his tool down, pulled on his coat, blew out his candle, took his
 lamp, and went. Down the main road the lights of the other men went
 swinging. There was a hollow sound of many voices. It was a long, heavy
 tramp underground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat at the bottom of the pit, where the great drops of water fell
 plash. Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up, talking noisily.
 Morel gave his answers short and disagreeable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's rainin', Sorry," said old Giles, who had had the news from the top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel found one comfort. He had his old umbrella, which he loved, in the
 lamp cabin. At last he took his stand on the chair, and was at the top in
 a moment. Then he handed in his lamp and got his umbrella, which he had
 bought at an auction for one-and-six. He stood on the edge of the pit-bank
 for a moment, looking out over the fields; grey rain was falling. The
 trucks stood full of wet, bright coal. Water ran down the sides of the
 waggons, over the white "C.W. and Co.". Colliers, walking indifferent to
 the rain, were streaming down the line and up the field, a grey, dismal
 host. Morel put up his umbrella, and took pleasure from the peppering of
 the drops thereon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All along the road to Bestwood the miners tramped, wet and grey and dirty,
 but their red mouths talking with animation. Morel also walked with a
 gang, but he said nothing. He frowned peevishly as he went. Many men
 passed into the Prince of Wales or into Ellen's. Morel, feeling
 sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation, trudged along under the
 dripping trees that overhung the park wall, and down the mud of Greenhill
 Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel lay in bed, listening to the rain, and the feet of the colliers
 from Minton, their voices, and the bang, bang of the gates as they went
 through the stile up the field.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's some herb beer behind the pantry door," she said. "Th' master'll
 want a drink, if he doesn't stop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he was late, so she concluded he had called for a drink, since it was
 raining. What did he care about the child or her?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was very ill when her children were born.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" she asked, feeling sick to death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she took consolation in that. The thought of being the mother of men
 was warming to her heart. She looked at the child. It had blue eyes, and a
 lot of fair hair, and was bonny. Her love came up hot, in spite of
 everything. She had it in bed with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel, thinking nothing, dragged his way up the garden path, wearily and
 angrily. He closed his umbrella, and stood it in the sink; then he
 sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen. Mrs. Bower appeared in the
 inner doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she said, "she's about as bad as she can be. It's a boy childt."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The miner grunted, put his empty snap-bag and his tin bottle on the
 dresser, went back into the scullery and hung up his coat, then came and
 dropped into his chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Han yer got a drink?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The woman went into the pantry. There was heard the pop of a cork. She set
 the mug, with a little, disgusted rap, on the table before Morel. He
 drank, gasped, wiped his big moustache on the end of his scarf, drank,
 gasped, and lay back in his chair. The woman would not speak to him again.
 She set his dinner before him, and went upstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was that the master?" asked Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've gave him his dinner," replied Mrs. Bower.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After he had sat with his arms on the table?he resented the fact
 that Mrs. Bower put no cloth on for him, and gave him a little plate,
 instead of a full-sized dinner-plate?he began to eat. The fact that
 his wife was ill, that he had another boy, was nothing to him at that
 moment. He was too tired; he wanted his dinner; he wanted to sit with his
 arms lying on the board; he did not like having Mrs. Bower about. The fire
 was too small to please him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After he had finished his meal, he sat for twenty minutes; then he stoked
 up a big fire. Then, in his stockinged feet, he went reluctantly upstairs.
 It was a struggle to face his wife at this moment, and he was tired. His
 face was black, and smeared with sweat. His singlet had dried again,
 soaking the dirt in. He had a dirty woollen scarf round his throat. So he
 stood at the foot of the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, how are ter, then?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I s'll be all right," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood at a loss what to say next. He was tired, and this bother was
 rather a nuisance to him, and he didn't quite know where he was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A lad, tha says," he stammered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned down the sheet and showed the child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bless him!" he murmured. Which made her laugh, because he blessed by rote?pretending
 paternal emotion, which he did not feel just then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go now," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will, my lass," he answered, turning away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dismissed, he wanted to kiss her, but he dared not. She half wanted him to
 kiss her, but could not bring herself to give any sign. She only breathed
 freely when he was gone out of the room again, leaving behind him a faint
 smell of pit-dirt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel had a visit every day from the Congregational clergyman. Mr.
 Heaton was young, and very poor. His wife had died at the birth of his
 first baby, so he remained alone in the manse. He was a Bachelor of Arts
 of Cambridge, very shy, and no preacher. Mrs. Morel was fond of him, and
 he depended on her. For hours he talked to her, when she was well. He
 became the god-parent of the child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Occasionally the minister stayed to tea with Mrs. Morel. Then she laid the
 cloth early, got out her best cups, with a little green rim, and hoped
 Morel would not come too soon; indeed, if he stayed for a pint, she would
 not mind this day. She had always two dinners to cook, because she
 believed children should have their chief meal at midday, whereas Morel
 needed his at five o'clock. So Mr. Heaton would hold the baby, whilst Mrs.
 Morel beat up a batter-pudding or peeled the potatoes, and he, watching
 her all the time, would discuss his next sermon. His ideas were quaint and
 fantastic. She brought him judiciously to earth. It was a discussion of
 the wedding at Cana.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When He changed the water into wine at Cana," he said, "that is a symbol
 that the ordinary life, even the blood, of the married husband and wife,
 which had before been uninspired, like water, became filled with the
 Spirit, and was as wine, because, when love enters, the whole spiritual
 constitution of a man changes, is filled with the Holy Ghost, and almost
 his form is altered."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel thought to herself:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, poor fellow, his young wife is dead; that is why he makes his love
 into the Holy Ghost."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heard the sluther
 of pit-boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Morel, in spite of herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The minister looked rather scared. Morel entered. He was feeling rather
 savage. He nodded a "How d'yer do" to the clergyman, who rose to shake
 hands with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay," said Morel, showing his hand, "look thee at it! Tha niver wants ter
 shake hands wi' a hand like that, does ter? There's too much pick-haft and
 shovel-dirt on it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The minister flushed with confusion, and sat down again. Mrs. Morel rose,
 carried out the steaming saucepan. Morel took off his coat, dragged his
 armchair to table, and sat down heavily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you tired?" asked the clergyman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tired? I ham that," replied Morel. "YOU don't know what it is to be
 tired, as I'M tired."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," replied the clergyman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, look yer 'ere," said the miner, showing the shoulders of his
 singlet. "It's a bit dry now, but it's wet as a clout with sweat even yet.
 Feel it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Mr. Heaton doesn't want to feel your nasty
 singlet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clergyman put out his hand gingerly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, perhaps he doesn't," said Morel; "but it's all come out of me,
 whether or not. An' iv'ry day alike my singlet's wringin' wet. 'Aven't you
 got a drink, Missis, for a man when he comes home barkled up from the
 pit?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know you drank all the beer," said Mrs. Morel, pouring out his tea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' was there no more to be got?" Turning to the clergyman?"A man
 gets that caked up wi' th' dust, you know,?that clogged up down a
 coal-mine, he NEEDS a drink when he comes home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am sure he does," said the clergyman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's ten to one if there's owt for him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's water?and there's tea," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Water! It's not water as'll clear his throat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He poured out a saucerful of tea, blew it, and sucked it up through his
 great black moustache, sighing afterwards. Then he poured out another
 saucerful, and stood his cup on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My cloth!" said Mrs. Morel, putting it on a plate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A man as comes home as I do 's too tired to care about cloths," said
 Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pity!" exclaimed his wife, sarcastically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The room was full of the smell of meat and vegetables and pit-clothes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He leaned over to the minister, his great moustache thrust forward, his
 mouth very red in his black face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Heaton," he said, "a man as has been down the black hole all day,
 dingin' away at a coal-face, yi, a sight harder than that wall?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Needn't make a moan of it," put in Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She hated her husband because, whenever he had an audience, he whined and
 played for sympathy. William, sitting nursing the baby, hated him, with a
 boy's hatred for false sentiment, and for the stupid treatment of his
 mother. Annie had never liked him; she merely avoided him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the minister had gone, Mrs. Morel looked at her cloth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A fine mess!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dos't think I'm goin' to sit wi' my arms danglin', cos tha's got a parson
 for tea wi' thee?" he bawled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were both angry, but she said nothing. The baby began to cry, and
 Mrs. Morel, picking up a saucepan from the hearth, accidentally knocked
 Annie on the head, whereupon the girl began to whine, and Morel to shout
 at her. In the midst of this pandemonium, William looked up at the big
 glazed text over the mantelpiece and read distinctly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God Bless Our Home!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon Mrs. Morel, trying to soothe the baby, jumped up, rushed at him,
 boxed his ears, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are YOU putting in for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then she sat down and laughed, till tears ran over her cheeks, while
 William kicked the stool he had been sitting on, and Morel growled:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I canna see what there is so much to laugh at."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening, directly after the parson's visit, feeling unable to bear
 herself after another display from her husband, she took Annie and the
 baby and went out. Morel had kicked William, and the mother would never
 forgive him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went over the sheep-bridge and across a corner of the meadow to the
 cricket-ground. The meadows seemed one space of ripe, evening light,
 whispering with the distant mill-race. She sat on a seat under the alders
 in the cricket-ground, and fronted the evening. Before her, level and
 solid, spread the big green cricket-field, like the bed of a sea of light.
 Children played in the bluish shadow of the pavilion. Many rooks, high up,
 came cawing home across the softly-woven sky. They stooped in a long curve
 down into the golden glow, concentrating, cawing, wheeling, like black
 flakes on a slow vortex, over a tree clump that made a dark boss among the
 pasture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few gentlemen were practising, and Mrs. Morel could hear the chock of
 the ball, and the voices of men suddenly roused; could see the white forms
 of men shifting silently over the green, upon which already the under
 shadows were smouldering. Away at the grange, one side of the haystacks
 was lit up, the other sides blue-grey. A waggon of sheaves rocked small
 across the melting yellow light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sun was going down. Every open evening, the hills of Derbyshire were
 blazed over with red sunset. Mrs. Morel watched the sun sink from the
 glistening sky, leaving a soft flower-blue overhead, while the western
 space went red, as if all the fire had swum down there, leaving the bell
 cast flawless blue. The mountain-ash berries across the field stood
 fierily out from the dark leaves, for a moment. A few shocks of corn in a
 corner of the fallow stood up as if alive; she imagined them bowing;
 perhaps her son would be a Joseph. In the east, a mirrored sunset floated
 pink opposite the west's scarlet. The big haystacks on the hillside, that
 butted into the glare, went cold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With Mrs. Morel it was one of those still moments when the small frets
 vanish, and the beauty of things stands out, and she had the peace and the
 strength to see herself. Now and again, a swallow cut close to her. Now
 and again, Annie came up with a handful of alder-currants. The baby was
 restless on his mother's knee, clambering with his hands at the light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel looked down at him. She had dreaded this baby like a
 catastrophe, because of her feeling for her husband. And now she felt
 strangely towards the infant. Her heart was heavy because of the child,
 almost as if it were unhealthy, or malformed. Yet it seemed quite well.
 But she noticed the peculiar knitting of the baby's brows, and the
 peculiar heaviness of its eyes, as if it were trying to understand
 something that was pain. She felt, when she looked at her child's dark,
 brooding pupils, as if a burden were on her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He looks as if he was thinking about something?quite sorrowful,"
 said Mrs. Kirk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly, looking at him, the heavy feeling at the mother's heart melted
 into passionate grief. She bowed over him, and a few tears shook swiftly
 out of her very heart. The baby lifted his fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My lamb!" she cried softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And at that moment she felt, in some far inner place of her soul, that she
 and her husband were guilty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The baby was looking up at her. It had blue eyes like her own, but its
 look was heavy, steady, as if it had realised something that had stunned
 some point of its soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In her arms lay the delicate baby. Its deep blue eyes, always looking up
 at her unblinking, seemed to draw her innermost thoughts out of her. She
 no longer loved her husband; she had not wanted this child to come, and
 there it lay in her arms and pulled at her heart. She felt as if the navel
 string that had connected its frail little body with hers had not been
 broken. A wave of hot love went over her to the infant. She held it close
 to her face and breast. With all her force, with all her soul she would
 make up to it for having brought it into the world unloved. She would love
 it all the more now it was here; carry it in her love. Its clear, knowing
 eyes gave her pain and fear. Did it know all about her? When it lay under
 her heart, had it been listening then? Was there a reproach in the look?
 She felt the marrow melt in her bones, with fear and pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more she was aware of the sun lying red on the rim of the hill
 opposite. She suddenly held up the child in her hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look!" she said. "Look, my pretty!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She thrust the infant forward to the crimson, throbbing sun, almost with
 relief. She saw him lift his little fist. Then she put him to her bosom
 again, ashamed almost of her impulse to give him back again whence he
 came.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If he lives," she thought to herself, "what will become of him?what
 will he be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her heart was anxious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will call him Paul," she said suddenly; she knew not why.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a while she went home. A fine shadow was flung over the deep green
 meadow, darkening all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she expected, she found the house empty. But Morel was home by ten
 o'clock, and that day, at least, ended peacefully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Walter Morel was, at this time, exceedingly irritable. His work seemed to
 exhaust him. When he came home he did not speak civilly to anybody. If the
 fire were rather low he bullied about that; he grumbled about his dinner;
 if the children made a chatter he shouted at them in a way that made their
 mother's blood boil, and made them hate him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The baby was unwell, and
 was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel, tired to death, and
 still weak, was scarcely under control.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She was too tired to
 carry him to the cradle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said. "It only works
 me up; I won't say anything. But I know if he does anything it'll make my
 blood boil," she added to herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she could not
 bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kept her head bent
 over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him. But it went through
 her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing, he lurched against the
 dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutched at the white pot knobs
 for support. He hung up his hat and coat, then returned, stood glowering
 from a distance at her, as she sat bowed over the child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently, as if to a
 servant. In certain stages of his intoxication he affected the clipped,
 mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morel hated him most in this condition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly, it sounded
 impersonal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer," he said
 affectedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward. He leaned on the table
 with one hand, and with the other jerked at the table drawer to get a
 knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because he pulled sideways. In a
 temper he dragged it, so that it flew out bodily, and spoons, forks,
 knives, a hundred metallic things, splashed with a clatter and a clang
 upon the brick floor. The baby gave a little convulsed start.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?" the mother cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should get up, like
 other women have to, an' wait on a man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wait on you?wait on you?" she cried. "Yes, I see myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes tha sh'lt wait on
 me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speech he turned round.
 His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot. He stared at her one silent
 second in threat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply on his
 shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer crashed into the
 fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned from her chair. To her very
 soul she was sick; she clasped the child tightly to her bosom. A few
 moments elapsed; then, with an effort, she brought herself to. The baby
 was crying plaintively. Her left brow was bleeding rather profusely. As
 she glanced down at the child, her brain reeling, some drops of blood
 soaked into its white shawl; but the baby was at least not hurt. She
 balanced her head to keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with one hand,
 looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance, he went
 across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her rocking-chair,
 almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her, and swaying as he
 spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did it catch thee?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child. With the
 catastrophe he had lost all balance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hiccoughed. "Let's?let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go away!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lemme?lemme look at it, lass."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying grasp on
 the back of her rocking-chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all her
 strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will, moving
 as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she bathed her eye
 for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy. Afraid lest she should
 swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair, trembling in every fibre. By
 instinct, she kept the baby clasped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back into its cavity,
 and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws, for the scattered spoons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and came craning his
 neck towards her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched, humble
 tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can see what it's done," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which grasped his legs
 just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound. She drew away from
 the thrust of his face with its great moustache, averting her own face as
 much as possible. As he looked at her, who was cold and impassive as
 stone, with mouth shut tight, he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness
 of spirit. He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall
 from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.
 Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud,
 and pull down the gossamer. Another drop fell. It would soak through to
 the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, feeling it soak in; then,
 finally, his manhood broke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What of this child?" was all his wife said to him. But her low, intense
 tones brought his head lower. She softened: "Get me some wadding out of
 the middle drawer," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a pad, which
 she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead, as she sat with the
 baby on her lap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now that clean pit-scarf."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presently with a
 red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingers proceeded to
 bind it round her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can do it myself," she replied. When it was done she went upstairs,
 telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the morning Mrs. Morel said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I was getting a raker
 in the dark, because the candle blew out." Her two small children looked
 up at her with wide, dismayed eyes. They said nothing, but their parted
 lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. He did not
 think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thought of anything, but
 he would not think of that. He lay and suffered like a sulking dog. He had
 hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged because he would never say
 a word to her, or express his sorrow. He tried to wriggle out of it. "It
 was her own fault," he said to himself. Nothing, however, could prevent
 his inner consciousness inflicting on him the punishment which ate into
 his spirit like rust, and which he could only alleviate by drinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word, or to
 move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had himself violent
 pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon he rose, cut himself food
 in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped, then pulled on his boots, and
 went out, to return at three o'clock slightly tipsy and relieved; then
 once more straight to bed. He rose again at six in the evening, had tea
 and went straight out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till 2.30, dinner,
 and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morel went upstairs, towards
 four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress, he was fast asleep. She would
 have felt sorry for him, if he had once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no;
 he insisted to himself it was her fault. And so he broke himself. So she
 merely left him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them,
 and she was stronger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all sat down to meals
 together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let him lie," the mother replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The children breathed
 the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were rather
 disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That was characteristic
 of him all his life. He was all for activity. The prostrated inactivity of
 two mornings was stifling him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he entered without
 hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again. He did not
 care any longer what the family thought or felt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloud from "The
 Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally "why?" Both children
 hushed into silence as they heard the approaching thud of their father's
 stockinged feet, and shrank as he entered. Yet he was usually indulgent to
 them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drank more noisily than he
 had need. No one spoke to him. The family life withdrew, shrank away, and
 became hushed as he entered. But he cared no longer about his alienation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out. It was
 this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened Mrs. Morel. As she
 heard him sousing heartily in cold water, heard the eager scratch of the
 steel comb on the side of the bowl, as he wetted his hair, she closed her
 eyes in disgust. As he bent over, lacing his boots, there was a certain
 vulgar gusto in his movement that divided him from the reserved, watchful
 rest of the family. He always ran away from the battle with himself. Even
 in his own heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't
 said so-and-so, it would never have happened. She asked for what she's
 got." The children waited in restraint during his preparations. When he
 had gone, they sighed with relief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was a rainy evening. The
 Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened forward in anticipation. All
 the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone black with wet. The roads, always
 dark with coal-dust, were full of blackish mud. He hastened along. The
 Palmerston windows were steamed over. The passage was paddled with wet
 feet. But the air was warm, if foul, and full of the sound of voices and
 the smell of beer and smoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel appeared in
 the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad. In a
 minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him, all shame,
 all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreaded his wife.
 Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what to do with himself
 that evening, having not even twopence with which to go to the Palmerston,
 and being already rather deeply in debt. So, while his wife was down the
 garden with the child, he hunted in the top drawer of the dresser where
 she kept her purse, found it, and looked inside. It contained a
 half-crown, two halfpennies, and a sixpence. So he took the sixpence, put
 the purse carefully back, and went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she looked in the
 purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes. Then she sat down
 and thought: "WAS there a sixpence? I hadn't spent it, had I? And I hadn't
 left it anywhere else?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it. And, as she
 sought, the conviction came into her heart that her husband had taken it.
 What she had in her purse was all the money she possessed. But that he
 should sneak it from her thus was unbearable. He had done so twice before.
 The first time she had not accused him, and at the week-end he had put the
 shilling again into her purse. So that was how she had known he had taken
 it. The second time he had not paid back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner?he
 came home early that day?she said to him coldly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way. "No, I didna! I niver
 clapped eyes on your purse."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she could detect the lie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you know you did," she said quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell you I didna," he shouted. "Yer at me again, are yer? I've had
 about enough on't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking the clothes in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his chair in
 desperation. He bustled and got washed, then went determinedly upstairs.
 Presently he came down dressed, and with a big bundle in a blue-checked,
 enormous handkerchief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched out of
 the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly, but her heart
 brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went to some other pit,
 obtained work, and got in with another woman? But she knew him too well?he
 couldn't. She was dead sure of him. Nevertheless her heart was gnawed
 inside her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He says he's run away," replied the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief, and says
 he's not coming back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What shall we do?" cried the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel sat and
 laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before the night's
 out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on. Mrs. Morel
 grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said it would be a
 relief to see the last of him; another part fretted because of keeping the
 children; and inside her, as yet, she could not quite let him go. At the
 bottom, she knew very well he could NOT go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden, however,
 she felt something behind the door. So she looked. And there in the dark
 lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece of coal and laughed. Every
 time she saw it, so fat and yet so ignominious, slunk into its corner in
 the dark, with its ends flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she
 laughed again. She was relieved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew, so if he stopped
 he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him?tired to death.
 He had not even the courage to carry his bundle beyond the yard-end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door and came in,
 slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word. He took off his coat, and
 slunk to his armchair, where he began to take off his boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off," she said
 quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said, looking up
 from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your parcel through
 the yard-end," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him. He continued to
 take his boots off and prepare for bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said. "But if you
 leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently and
 crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs. As Mrs. Morel
 saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway, holding his bundle, she
 laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter, because she had loved him.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER III
 </h2>
 <h3>
 THE CASTING OFF OF MOREL?THE TAKING ON OF WILLIAM
 </h3>
 <p>
 DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable. Like all
 miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which, strangely enough, he
 would often pay for himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a winder as we
 canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite first medicine.
 And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had hanging in the attic
 great bunches of dried herbs: wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers,
 parsley-purt, marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there
 was a jug of one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he
 drank largely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!" And he
 exhorted the children to try.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed. But they
 were not to be tempted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs would
 shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an attack of an
 inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since his sleeping on
 the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham. Since then he had drunk
 and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill, and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse.
 He was one of the worst patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and
 putting aside the fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him
 to die. Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some had the children
 in to meals, occasionally some would do the downstairs work for her, one
 would mind the baby for a day. But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It
 was not every day the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and
 husband, cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
 but she did what was wanted of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen shillings a week from
 clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other butty put by a portion of the
 stall's profits for Morel's wife. And the neighbours made broths, and gave
 eggs, and such invalids' trifles. If they had not helped her so generously
 in those times, Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without
 incurring debts that would have dragged her down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better. He had a fine
 constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight forward to
 recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs. During his illness his
 wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted her to continue. He often put
 his band to his head, pulled down the comers of his mouth, and shammed
 pains he did not feel. But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely
 smiled to herself. Then she scolded him sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy. He was
 forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time. Mrs.
 Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost like a
 child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant because
 she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all, he had been her
 husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less, what he did to
 himself he did to her. Her living depended on him. There were many, many
 stages in the ebbing of her love for him, but it was always ebbing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set towards
 him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose, standing off from
 him. After this she scarcely desired him. And, standing more aloof from
 him, not feeling him so much part of herself, but merely part of her
 circumstances, she did not mind so much what he did, could leave him
 alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year, which is like
 autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off, half regretfully,
 but relentlessly; casting him off and turning now for love and life to the
 children. Henceforward he was more or less a husk. And he himself
 acquiesced, as so many men do, yielding their place to their children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During his recuperation, when it was really over between them, both made
 an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship of the first
 months of their marriage. He sat at home and, when the children were in
 bed, and she was sewing?she did all her sewing by hand, made all
 shirts and children's clothing?he would read to her from the
 newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering the words like a man pitching
 quoits. Often she hurried him on, giving him a phrase in anticipation. And
 then he took her words humbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The silences between them were peculiar. There would be the swift, slight
 "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his lips as he let out the
 smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars as he spat in the fire. Then her
 thoughts turned to William. Already he was getting a big boy. Already he
 was top of the class, and the master said he was the smartest lad in the
 school. She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
 again for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing to think about,
 would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul would reach out in its
 blind way to her and find her gone. He felt a sort of emptiness, almost
 like a vacuum in his soul. He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could
 not live in that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an
 oppression on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
 Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone, working,
 thinking, living.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace and
 tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen months old
 when the new baby was born. He was then a plump, pale child, quiet, with
 heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar slight knitting of the brows. The
 last child was also a boy, fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she
 knew she was with child, both for economic reasons and because she did not
 love her husband; but not for the sake of the infant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a mop of gold curls,
 and he loved his father from the first. Mrs. Morel was glad this child
 loved the father. Hearing the miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his
 arms and crow. And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back
 immediately, in his hearty, mellow voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would put an
 apron round the child, and give him to his father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes, taking back the
 baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's kisses and play. Then
 Morel laughed joyfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the children
 included the father in her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active, while Paul,
 always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer, and trotted after his
 mother like her shadow. He was usually active and interested, but
 sometimes he would have fits of depression. Then the mother would find the
 boy of three or four crying on the sofa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," sobbed the child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him, but without effect.
 It made her feel beside herself. Then the father, always impatient, would
 jump from his chair and shout:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly. And then she
 carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his little chair, and
 said: "Now cry there, Misery!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye, or at
 last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often, but they caused
 a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment of Paul was different
 from that of the other children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley of the Bottoms for
 the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her. It was the thin little Mrs.
 Anthony in brown velvet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n 'is back," Mrs.
 Anthony said, "wants showing something."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold of the boy's
 collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children, and even if I did, I
 should want to hear their side of the tale."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding," retorted
 Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean collar off'n 'is
 back a-purpose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled as she held
 her mug of barm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted to be off
 again?he was then eleven years old?his mother said to him:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When did I tear his collar?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know when, but his mother says you did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?it was yesterday?an' it was torn a'ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you tore it more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen?an' Alfy Ant'ny 'e
 says:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> 'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
 Went down to a river to bade.
 Adam an' Eve got drownded,
 Who do yer think got saved?'
</pre>
 <p>
 An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an' 'e was mad, an'
 so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it. An' so I run after 'im, an'
 when I was gettin' hold of 'im, 'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I
 got my cobbler?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on a string.
 This old cobbler had "cobbled"?hit and smashed?seventeen other
 cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip his collar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it?an' it
 was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful. I shouldn't like it if
 you came home with your collar torn off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?well, you be more careful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel, who hated any
 bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain to Mrs. Anthony, and
 the business would be over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour. He stood in
 the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for some minutes. Then:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his pit-bottle on
 to the dresser.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning to you about
 Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get hold of 'IM
 I'll make his bones rattle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready to side with
 any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales against your own
 children."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose lad 'e is; 'e's
 none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's a mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel. "He was running after
 that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he accidentally got hold of his
 collar, because the other dodged?as an Anthony would."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some loud-mouthed
 creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know," repeated Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper. Suddenly William
 ran in, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I have my tea, mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look so ridiculous."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel, rising
 from his chair and glaring at his son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive, had gone
 pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched his fist, and
 crouched.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall not touch him for
 HER telling, you shall not!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang in between
 them, with her fist lifted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you DARE!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She spun round to her son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone. Morel
 rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under his pit-dirt
 with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare, milord, to lay
 a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel joined the
 Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached to the Co-operative
 Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night in the long room over the
 grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The women were supposed to discuss
 the benefits to be derived from co-operation, and other social questions.
 Sometimes Mrs. Morel read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see
 their mother, who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
 rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again. They felt
 for her on such occasions the deepest respect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they did not
 grudge their mother?and that partly because she enjoyed it, partly
 because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild was called by some
 hostile husbands, who found their wives getting too independent, the
 "clat-fart" shop?that is, the gossip-shop. It is true, from off the
 basis of the Guild, the women could look at their homes, at the conditions
 of their own lives, and find fault. So the colliers found their women had
 a new standard of their own, rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel
 always had a lot of news on Monday nights, so that the children liked
 William to be in when their mother came home, because she told him things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in the "Co-op." office.
 He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather rough features and real
 viking blue eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?" said Morel. "All
 he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an' earn nowt. What's 'e
 startin' wi'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy ten shillin' a
 wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end out on a
 stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's an end of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason why I should
 do the same with my lad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school, and learned
 shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was the best shorthand
 clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one. Then he taught in the
 night schools. But he was so fiery that only his good-nature and his size
 protected him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the things that men do?the decent things?William did. He
 could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first prize in a
 race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil. It stood proudly on the
 dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure. The boy only ran for her. He
 flew home with his anvil, breathless, with a "Look, mother!" That was the
 first real tribute to herself. She took it like a queen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How pretty!" she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to his mother. When
 he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him back two for himself,
 and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich. He went about with the
 bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained nothing higher than the
 clergyman. Then came the bank manager, then the doctors, then the
 tradespeople, and after that the hosts of colliers. Willam began to
 consort with the sons of the chemist, the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen.
 He played billiards in the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced?this in
 spite of his mother. All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from
 the sixpenny-hops down Church Street, to sports and billiards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of flower-like
 ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's heart for a brief
 fortnight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant swain. Mrs.
 Morel would find a strange girl at the door, and immediately she sniffed
 the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which one? There are several."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I met Mr. Morel?at Ripley," she explained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?at a dance!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances. And he is NOT at
 home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the girl away so
 rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow, who walked with long
 strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap pushed jollily to the back
 of his head. Now he came in frowning. He threw his cap on to the sofa, and
 took his strong jaw in his hand, and glared down at his mother. She was
 small, with her hair taken straight back from her forehead. She had a
 quiet air of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
 she trembled inwardly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why didn't you tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I forgot, simply."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He fumed a little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A good-looking girl?seemed a lady?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't look at her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Big brown eyes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're running
 after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you. Tell them that?brazen
 baggages you meet at dancing-classes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure she was a nice girl."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I'm sure she wasn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great strife
 between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its height when
 William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard?considered a low town?to
 a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander. There was a dress he could
 hire, which one of his friends had had, and which fitted him perfectly.
 The Highland suit came home. Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not
 unpack it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My suit come?" cried William.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's a parcel in the front room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rushed in and cut the string.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured, showing her the
 suit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know I don't want to fancy you in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress, Mrs. Morel
 put on her coat and bonnet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; I don't want to see you," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard. She was afraid of
 her son's going the same way as his father. He hesitated a moment, and his
 heart stood still with anxiety. Then he caught sight of the Highland
 bonnet with its ribbons. He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She
 went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got a
 situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings a week
 instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and his father
 were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William. It seemed he was
 going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped, with his aid, to help her
 younger sons. Annie was now studying to be a teacher. Paul, also very
 clever, was getting on well, having lessons in French and German from his
 godfather, the clergyman who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a
 spoilt and very good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was
 talk of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham. He was studying
 hard, and growing serious. Something seemed to be fretting him. Still he
 went out to the dances and the river parties. He did not drink. The
 children were all rabid teetotallers. He came home very late at night, and
 sat yet longer studying. His mother implored him to take more care, to do
 one thing or another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can work in the
 office, and then amuse yourself, and THEN study on top of all. You can't;
 the human frame won't stand it. Do one thing or the other?amuse
 yourself or learn Latin; but don't try to do both."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year. This seemed
 a fabulous sum. His mother doubted almost whether to rejoice or to grieve.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he cried, his eyes
 blazing as he read the letter. Mrs. Morel felt everything go silent inside
 her. He read the letter: "'And will you reply by Thursday whether you
 accept. Yours faithfully?' They want me, mother, at a hundred and
 twenty a year, and don't even ask to see me. Didn't I tell you I could do
 it! Think of me in London! And I can give you twenty pounds a year, mater.
 We s'll all be rolling in money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We shall, my son," she answered sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going away
 than glad of his success. Indeed, as the days drew near for his departure,
 her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair. She loved him so
 much! More than that, she hoped in him so much. Almost she lived by him.
 She liked to do things for him: she liked to put a cup for his tea and to
 iron his collars, of which he was so proud. It was a joy to her to have
 him proud of his collars. There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at
 them with her little convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the
 sheer pressure of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was
 going away. She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart.
 He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief
 and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few days before his departure?he was just twenty?he burned
 his love-letters. They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen
 cupboard. From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of
 them she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, on the Saturday morning he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can have the birds
 and flowers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday, because he was
 having a last day's holiday. She was making him a rice cake, which he
 loved, to take with him. He was scarcely conscious that she was so
 miserable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the first letter off the file. It was mauve-tinted, and had purple
 and green thistles. William sniffed the page.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nice scent! Smell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Um!" said Paul, breathing in. "What d'you call it? Smell, mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother ducked her small, fine nose down to the paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus. He owns
 property without end. She calls me Lafayette, because I know French. 'You
 will see, I've forgiven you'?I like HER forgiving me. 'I told mother
 about you this morning, and she will have much pleasure if you come to tea
 on Sunday, but she will have to get father's consent also. I sincerely
 hope he will agree. I will let you know how it transpires. If, however,
 you?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Transpires'?oh yes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Transpires!'" repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly. "I thought she was so well
 educated!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden, giving
 Paul the corner with the thistles. He continued to read extracts from his
 letters, some of which amused his mother, some of which saddened her and
 made her anxious for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My lad," she said, "they're very wise. They know they've only got to
 flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like a dog that has its head
 scratched."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied. "And when
 they've done, I trot away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you can't pull
 off," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't flatter themselves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You flatter YOURSELF," she said quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained of the
 file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or forty pretty
 tickets from the corners of the notepaper?swallows and
 forget-me-nots and ivy sprays. And William went to London, to start a new
 life.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV
 </h2>
 <h3>
 THE YOUNG LIFE OF PAUL
 </h3>
 <p>
 PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small. His fair
 hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey. He was a pale,
 quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and with a full, dropping
 underlip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so conscious of what other
 people felt, particularly his mother. When she fretted he understood, and
 could have no peace. His soul seemed always attentive to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he grew older he became stronger. William was too far removed from him
 to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boy belonged at first almost
 entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a "flybie-skybie", as her mother
 called her. But she was intensely fond of her second brother. So Paul was
 towed round at the heels of Annie, sharing her game. She raced wildly at
 lerky with the other young wild-cats of the Bottoms. And always Paul flew
 beside her, living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his
 own. He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him. He always
 seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not so fond.
 So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with an antimacassar, to
 sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul must practise jumping off the
 sofa arm. So he jumped crash into the face of the hidden doll. Annie
 rushed up, uttered a loud wail, and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul
 remained quite still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it was there,"
 he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept for the doll he sat
 helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out. She forgave her brother?he
 was so much upset. But a day or two afterwards she was shocked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said. "Let's burn her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to see what the boy
 would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of the shavings out of
 Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into the hollow face, poured on a
 little paraffin, and set the whole thing alight. He watched with wicked
 satisfaction the drops of wax melt off the broken forehead of Arabella,
 and drop like sweat into the flame. So long as the stupid big doll burned
 he rejoiced in silence. At the end be poked among the embers with a stick,
 fished out the arms and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under
 stones.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said. "An' I'm glad there's
 nothing left of her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing. He seemed
 to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly against their
 father, along with their mother. Morel continued to bully and to drink. He
 had periods, months at a time, when he made the whole life of the family a
 misery. Paul never forgot coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday
 evening and finding his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his
 father standing on the hearthrug, feet astride, his head down, and
 William, just home from work, glaring at his father. There was a silence
 as the young children entered, but none of the elders looked round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched. He waited
 until the children were silent, watching with children's rage and hate;
 then he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son. William was bigger,
 but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dossn't I?" he shouted. "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o' thy chelp, my young
 jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee. Ay, an' I sholl that, dost
 see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly, almost
 beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense. "It 'ud be the last time, though."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist to strike.
 William put his fists ready. A light came into his blue eyes, almost like
 a laugh. He watched his father. Another word, and the men would have begun
 to fight. Paul hoped they would. The three children sat pale on the sofa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice. "We've had
 enough for ONE night. And YOU," she said, turning on to her husband, "look
 at your children!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel glanced at the sofa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered. "Why, what
 have I done to the children, I should like to know? But they're like
 yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and nasty ways?you've
 learned 'em in it, you 'ave."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while he threw his boots
 under the table and went to bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William, when his father
 was upstairs. "I could easily have beaten him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A nice thing?your own father," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'FATHER!'" repeated William. "Call HIM MY father!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he is?and so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The idea!" she cried. "It hasn't come to THAT yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he said, "it's come to worse. Look at yourself. WHY didn't you let
 me give it him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it," she cried quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the children went to bed, miserably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms to a house
 on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley, which spread out
 like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it. In front of the
 house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind, sweeping from Derbyshire,
 caught the houses with full force, and the tree shrieked again. Morel
 liked it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's music," he said. "It sends me to sleep."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it became almost a
 demoniacal noise. The winter of their first year in the new house their
 father was very bad. The children played in the street, on the brim of the
 wide, dark valley, until eight o'clock. Then they went to bed. Their
 mother sat sewing below. Having such a great space in front of the house
 gave the children a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This
 terror came in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home
 discord. Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,
 aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he heard the
 booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the sharp
 replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on the
 table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher. And
 then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks and cries from
 the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The children lay silent in suspense,
 waiting for a lull in the wind to hear what their father was doing. He
 might hit their mother again. There was a feeling of horror, a kind of
 bristling in the darkness, and a sense of blood. They lay with their
 hearts in the grip of an intense anguish. The wind came through the tree
 fiercer and fiercer. All the chords of the great harp hummed, whistled,
 and shrieked. And then came the horror of the sudden silence, silence
 everywhere, outside and downstairs. What was it? Was it a silence of
 blood? What had he done?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last, they heard
 their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs in his stockinged
 feet. Still they listened. Then at last, if the wind allowed, they heard
 the water of the tap drumming into the kettle, which their mother was
 filling for morning, and they could go to sleep in peace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they were happy in the morning?happy, very happy playing, dancing
 at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of the darkness. But they
 had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts, one darkness in their
 eyes, which showed all their lives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night. "Lord, let my father
 die," he prayed very often. "Let him not be killed at pit," he prayed
 when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was another time when the family suffered intensely. The children
 came from school and had their teas. On the hob the big black saucepan was
 simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven, ready for Morel's dinner. He was
 expected at five o'clock. But for months he would stop and drink every
 night on his way from work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early, Mrs. Morel
 would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a tallow candle to save
 the gas. The children finished their bread-and-butter, or dripping, and
 were ready to go out to play. But if Morel had not come they faltered. The
 sense of his sitting in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's
 work, not coming home and eating and washing, but sitting, getting drunk,
 on an empty stomach, made Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself. From her the
 feeling was transmitted to the other children. She never suffered alone
 any more: the children suffered with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great trough of twilight,
 tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were. A few last colliers
 straggled up the dim field path. The lamplighter came along. No more
 colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley; work was done. It was
 night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle still burned on
 the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone. On the hob the
 saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting on the table. All the room
 was full of the sense of waiting, waiting for the man who was sitting in
 his pit-dirt, dinnerless, some mile away from home, across the darkness,
 drinking himself drunk. Paul stood in the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has my dad come?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the futility of the
 question.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They shared the same anxiety.
 Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained the potatoes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother for suffering
 because his father did not come home from work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you bother yourself for?" he said. "If he wants to stop and get
 drunk, why don't you let him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel. "You may well say 'let him'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a quick
 way to ruining himself and his home. The children were yet young, and
 depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the sense of relief,
 providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed. But the
 tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth lay on the table,
 still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense of anxiety and
 expectation in the room. The boy could not stand it any longer. He could
 not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger, next door but one, for
 her to talk to him. She had no children. Her husband was good to her but
 was in a shop, and came home late. So, when she saw the lad at the door,
 she called:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come in, Paul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly the boy rose, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his friend what
 ailed him. Then he ran indoors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous. He ate his
 food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he had done, pushed all
 the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his arms on the table. Then he
 went to sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head, with its black
 hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms, and the face, dirty
 and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin, paltry brows, was turned
 sideways, asleep with beer and weariness and nasty temper. If anyone
 entered suddenly, or a noise were made, the man looked up and shouted:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha doesna stop
 that clatter! Dost hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion, usually at Annie,
 made the family writhe with hate of the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything. The
 children, alone with their mother, told her all about the day's
 happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place in them until it
 was told to their mother. But as soon as the father came in, everything
 stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth, happy machinery of the
 home. And he was always aware of this fall of silence on his entry, the
 shutting off of life, the unwelcome. But now it was gone too far to alter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him, but they could
 not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You ought to tell your father."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper. Everybody was highly
 jubilant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you'd better tell your father when he comes in," said Mrs. Morel.
 "You know how be carries on and says he's never told anything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," said Paul. But he would almost rather have forfeited the
 prize than have to tell his father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said. Morel turned round to
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, nothing?about famous women."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a book."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, indeed!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About birds."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hm?hm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And that was all. Conversation was impossible between the father and any
 other member of the family. He was an outsider. He had denied the God in
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people was
 when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the evening, he
 cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. Then he always
 wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed it. They united with
 him in the work, in the actual doing of something, when he was his real
 self again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in a good
 humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost years, of
 friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly again. It was nice
 to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron into the scullery, crying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Out of my road?out of my road!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose, and made
 the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment, soldering. Then the
 children watched with joy as the metal sank suddenly molten, and was
 shoved about against the nose of the soldering-iron, while the room was
 full of a scent of burnt resin and hot tin, and Morel was silent and
 intent for a minute. He always sang when he mended boots because of the
 jolly sound of hammering. And he was rather happy when he sat putting
 great patches on his moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do,
 considering them too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses. Morel
 fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic. These he
 cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a stalk of gold, after
 which he cut the straws into lengths of about six inches, leaving, if he
 could, a notch at the bottom of each piece. He always had a beautifully
 sharp knife that could cut a straw clean without hurting it. Then he set
 in the middle of the table a heap of gunpowder, a little pile of black
 grains upon the white-scrubbed board. He made and trimmed the straws while
 Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them. Paul loved to see the black grains
 trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth of the straw, peppering
 jollily downwards till the straw was full. Then he bunged up the mouth
 with a bit of soap?which he got on his thumb-nail from a pat in a
 saucer?and the straw was finished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look, dad!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly lavish of
 endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse into the powder-tin,
 ready for the morning, when Morel would take it to the pit, and use it to
 fire a shot that would blast the coal down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean on the arm of
 Morel's chair and say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell us about down pit, daddy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This Morel loved to do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, there's one little 'oss?we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.
 "An' he's a fawce 'un!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feel Taffy's cunning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high. Well, he comes i'
 th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein' some snuff?'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead on yer, that
 cadin'.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what does he?" Arthur always asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody loved it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Or sometimes it was a new tale.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat on at
 snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And did you kill it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied wi' 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' what do they live on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The corn as the 'osses drops?an' they'll get in your pocket an' eat
 your snap, if you'll let 'em?no matter where yo' hing your coat?the
 slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel had some job to do.
 And then he always went to bed very early, often before the children.
 There was nothing remaining for him to stay up for, when he had finished
 tinkering, and had skimmed the headlines of the newspaper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the children felt secure when their father was in bed. They lay and
 talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights went suddenly
 sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in the hands of the
 colliers tramping by outside, going to take the nine o'clock shift. They
 listened to the voices of the men, imagined them dipping down into the
 dark valley. Sometimes they went to the window and watched the three or
 four lamps growing tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the
 darkness. Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in the
 warmth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis. The others were all
 quite strong; so this was another reason for his mother's difference in
 feeling for him. One day he came home at dinner-time feeling ill. But it
 was not a family to make any fuss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter with YOU?" his mother asked sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he ate no dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's why."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz cushions the
 children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze. That afternoon Mrs.
 Morel was ironing. She listened to the small, restless noise the boy made
 in his throat as she worked. Again rose in her heart the old, almost weary
 feeling towards him. She had never expected him to live. And yet he had a
 great vitality in his young body. Perhaps it would have been a little
 relief to her if he had died. She always felt a mixture of anguish in her
 love for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of the clatter of the
 iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud, thud on the ironing-board. Once
 roused, he opened his eyes to see his mother standing on the hearthrug
 with the hot iron near her cheek, listening, as it were, to the heat. Her
 still face, with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and
 self-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on one side, and her blue eyes
 so young, quick, and warm, made his heart contract with love. When she was
 quiet, so, she looked brave and rich with life, but as if she had been
 done out of her rights. It hurt the boy keenly, this feeling about her
 that she had never had her life's fulfilment: and his own incapability to
 make up to her hurt him with a sense of impotence, yet made him patiently
 dogged inside. It was his childish aim.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded, raced off the
 dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed the iron on the sack
 lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She was warm in the ruddy firelight.
 Paul loved the way she crouched and put her head on one side. Her
 movements were light and quick. It was always a pleasure to watch her.
 Nothing she ever did, no movement she ever made, could have been found
 fault with by her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot
 linen. Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did not mind much. What
 happened happened, and it was no good kicking against the pricks. He loved
 the evenings, after eight o'clock, when the light was put out, and he
 could watch the fire-flames spring over the darkness of the walls and
 ceiling; could watch huge shadows waving and tossing, till the room seemed
 full of men who battled silently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom. He was always
 very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed the atmosphere for the
 boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; is my mother comin'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?" Morel
 rarely "thee'd" his son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not long, my duckie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment or two. He
 felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the top of the stairs and
 said to his wife:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently to Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I want HER to come," insisted the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He says he can't go off till you come," Morel called downstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs. There's the
 other children?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire. He loved a
 fire dearly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She says she won't be long," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverish with
 irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate all his sick
 impatience. At last Morel, after having stood looking at his son awhile,
 said softly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night, my darling."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect, in spite
 of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved. The warmth, the security
 and peace of soul, the utter comfort from the touch of the other, knits
 the sleep, so that it takes the body and soul completely in its healing.
 Paul lay against her and slept, and got better; whilst she, always a bad
 sleeper, fell later on into a profound sleep that seemed to give her
 faith.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy horses feeding at
 the troughs in the field, scattering their hay on the trodden yellow snow;
 watch the miners troop home?small, black figures trailing slowly in
 gangs across the white field. Then the night came up in dark blue vapour
 from the snow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes, suddenly
 arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows, then were
 gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass. The snowflakes
 whirled round the corner of the house, like pigeons dashing by. Away
 across the valley the little black train crawled doubtfully over the great
 whiteness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they could do
 anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthur went out early in
 the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms, hunting through the wet
 grass, from which the larks were rising, for the white-skinned, wonderful
 naked bodies crouched secretly in the green. And if they got half a pound
 they felt exceedingly happy: there was the joy of finding something, the
 joy of accepting something straight from the hand of Nature, and the joy
 of contributing to the family exchequer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty, was the
 blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on the Saturdays;
 also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scoured the coppices and
 woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberry was to be found, every
 week-end going on their search. In that region of mining villages
 blackberries became a comparative rarity. But Paul hunted far and wide. He
 loved being out in the country, among the bushes. But he also could not
 bear to go home to his mother empty. That, he felt, would disappoint her,
 and he would have died rather.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in, late, and tired to
 death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over Misk Hills. And
 look here, our mother!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She peeped into the basket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And there's over two pounds?isn't there over two pounds"?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She tried the basket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she answered doubtfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought her one spray, the
 best he could find.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting a love-token.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than own himself
 beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She never realised this, whilst
 he was young. She was a woman who waited for her children to grow up. And
 William occupied her chiefly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at home, the
 mother made a companion of Paul. The latter was unconsciously jealous of
 his brother, and William was jealous of him. At the same time, they were
 good friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine,
 perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rule that Paul
 should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliers of the five pits
 were paid on Fridays, but not individually. All the earnings of each stall
 were put down to the chief butty, as contractor, and he divided the wages
 again, either in the public-house or in his own home. So that the children
 could fetch the money, school closed early on Friday afternoons. Each of
 the Morel children?William, then Annie, then Paul?had fetched
 the money on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work. Paul
 used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag in his
 pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men were seen
 trooping to the offices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building, almost like
 a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of Greenhill Lane. The
 waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room paved with blue brick, and
 having a seat all round, against the wall. Here sat the colliers in their
 pit-dirt. They had come up early. The women and children usually loitered
 about on the red gravel paths. Paul always examined the grass border, and
 the big grass bank, because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny
 forget-me-nots. There was a sound of many voices. The women had on their
 Sunday hats. The girls chattered loudly. Little dogs ran here and there.
 The green shrubs were silent all around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park?Spinney Park." All the
 folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was time for Bretty to be
 paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-room was quite small. A
 counter went across, dividing it into half. Behind the counter stood two
 men?Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk, Mr. Winterbottom. Mr. Braithwaite
 was large, somewhat of the stern patriarch in appearance, having a rather
 thin white beard. He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief,
 and right up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate. No
 window was open. Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats of the
 people, coming in from the freshness. Mr. Winterbottom was rather small
 and fat, and very bald. He made remarks that were not witty, whilst his
 chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions against the colliers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who had been home
 and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usually a dog. Paul
 was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammed behind the legs of
 the men, near the fire which scorched him. He knew the order of the names?they
 went according to stall number.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite. Then Mrs. Holliday
 stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bower?John Bower."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,
 glowered at him over his spectacles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "John Bower!" he repeated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's me," said the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy Mr.
 Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people tittered, thinking of
 John Bower senior.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite, in a large and
 magisterial voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's badly," piped the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the great cashier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking voice
 from behind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the men laughed. The large and important cashier looked down at his
 next sheet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat. He was
 pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning. But he did not
 hope to get through the wall of men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Morel?Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger and thumb on
 the invoice, ready to pass on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could not or
 would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him. Then Mr.
 Winterbottom came to the rescue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes. He pointed at
 the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside, and disclosed the
 boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul went to the counter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't you shout up when you're
 called?" said Mr. Braithwaite. He banged on to the invoice a five-pound
 bag of silver, then in a delicate and pretty movement, picked up a little
 ten-pound column of gold, and plumped it beside the silver. The gold slid
 in a bright stream over the paper. The cashier finished counting off the
 money; the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom, to
 whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid. Here he suffered
 again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward some loose silver
 and half a sovereign.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not the faintest notion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' cheek an' impidence," said another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers he got his money
 into the bag and slid out. He suffered the tortures of the damned on these
 occasions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the Mansfield Road,
 was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green. There were some gold
 and some white fowls pecking under the apple trees of an orchard. The
 colliers were walking home in a stream. The boy went near the wall,
 self-consciously. He knew many of the men, but could not recognise them in
 their dirt. And this was a new torture to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not yet come.
 Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother, Morel's mother, had
 been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar
 half-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly to
 grown men. "Sit you down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar. Some colliers were
 "reckoning"?sharing out their money?in a corner; others came
 in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking. At last Morel came;
 brisk, and with something of an air, even in his blackness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son. "Have you bested me? Shall
 you have a drink of something?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists, and he
 would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all the men than in
 having a tooth drawn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlady looked at him <i>de haut en bas</i>, rather pitying, and at
 the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality. Paul went home,
 glowering. He entered the house silently. Friday was baking day, and there
 was usually a hot bun. His mother put it before him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm NOT going to the office any more," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise. His sudden rages
 rather amused her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm NOT going any more," he declared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well, tell your father so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He chewed his bun as if he hated it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not?I'm not going to fetch the money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough of the
 sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buying birthday
 presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it. But?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They can have it, then!" he said. "I don't want it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well," said his mother. "But you needn't bully ME about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are, and I'm not going any
 more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an' Mr. Winterbottom says 'You
 was'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyes dark and
 furious. His mother moved about at her work, taking no notice of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you at the
 Board-school?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They never taught HIM much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact?neither
 manners nor wit?and his cunning he was born with."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, in her own way, she soothed him. His ridiculous hypersensitiveness
 made her heart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyes roused her, made
 her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was the cheque?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen and six stoppages,"
 replied the boy. "It's a good week; and only five shillings stoppages for
 my father."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned, and could
 call him to account if he gave her short money. Morel always kept to
 himself the secret of the week's amount.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Friday was the baking night and market night. It was the rule that Paul
 should stay at home and bake. He loved to stop in and draw or read; he was
 very fond of drawing. Annie always "gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur
 was enjoying himself as usual. So the boy remained alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place on the top of the
 hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby, Ilkeston and Mansfield,
 meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ran in from surrounding villages.
 The market-place was full of women, the streets packed with men. It was
 amazing to see so many men everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually
 quarrelled with her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man?who
 was a gabey, but his wife was a bad 'un?laughed with the fish man?who
 was a scamp but so droll?put the linoleum man in his place, was cold
 with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she was
 driven?or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she was
 coldly polite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sevenpence to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave the
 market-place without it. Again she went by where the pots lay coldly on
 the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively, pretending not to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume. Her bonnet was in
 its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little bonnet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly. "And I'm sure
 it's right enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was reduced to black
 lace and a bit of jet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It looks rather come down," said Paul. "Couldn't you give it a
 pick-me-up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she tied the
 strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy, the pot man, had an
 uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something between them. Suddenly
 he shouted:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you want it for fivepence?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took up her
 dish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll have it," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said. "Yer'd better spit in it, like
 yer do when y'ave something give yer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't see you give it me," she said. "You wouldn't let me have it for
 fivepence if you didn't want to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky if you can
 give your things away," he growled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends. She dare now finger
 his pots. So she was happy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. She was always her
 best so?triumphant, tired, laden with parcels, feeling rich in
 spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entry and looked up from his
 drawing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word, you ARE loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his brush.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am!" she gasped. "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me. SUCH a weight!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The last one is soaking," he replied. "You needn't look, I've not
 forgotten it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door. "You know what a
 wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's quite so bad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy was attentive to her. She took off her little black bonnet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I think he can't make any money?well, it's everybody's cry
 alike nowadays?and it makes him disagreeable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would ME," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have?how much do you
 think he let me have THIS for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood looking on it
 with joy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Show me!" said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two stood together gloating over the dish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I LOVE cornflowers on things," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One and three," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fivepence!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not enough, mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'd been extravagant,
 I couldn't afford any more. And he needn't have let me have it if he
 hadn't wanted to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted each other
 from the fear of having robbed the pot man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or radishes and lettuce," said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's done," he said, giving it to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She tapped it also.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag. "Oh, and I'm a wicked,
 extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance. She
 unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of pansies and
 of crimson daisies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Four penn'orth!" she moaned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How CHEAP!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But lovely!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy. "Paul, look at this
 yellow one, isn't it?and a face just like an old man!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff. "And smells that nice! But he's a
 bit splashed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully washed
 the pansy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "NOW look at him now he's wet!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At the end where the
 Morels lived there were not many young things. So the few were more
 united. Boys and girls played together, the girls joining in the fights
 and the rough games, the boys taking part in the dancing games and rings
 and make-belief of the girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings, when it was not wet.
 They stayed indoors till the colliers were all gone home, till it was
 thick dark, and the street would be deserted. Then they tied their scarves
 round their necks, for they scorned overcoats, as all the colliers'
 children did, and went out. The entry was very dark, and at the end the
 whole great night opened out, in a hollow, with a little tangle of lights
 below where Minton pit lay, and another far away opposite for Selby. The
 farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever. The
 children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post, which stood
 at the end of the field path. If the little, luminous space were deserted,
 the two boys felt genuine desolation. They stood with their hands in their
 pockets under the lamp, turning their backs on the night, quite miserable,
 watching the dark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen,
 and a long-legged girl came flying up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it did not matter so much?there were three now. They set up a
 game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling. Then the
 play went fast and furious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoop of darkness,
 as if all the night were there. In front, another wide, dark way opened
 over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody came out of this way and went
 into the field down the path. In a dozen yards the night had swallowed
 them. The children played on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were brought exceedingly close together owing to their isolation. If
 a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt. Arthur was very touchy,
 and Billy Pillins?really Philips?was worse. Then Paul had to
 side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice, while Billy Pillins
 always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back him up. Then the six would
 fight, hate with a fury of hatred, and flee home in terror. Paul never
 forgot, after one of these fierce internecine fights, seeing a big red
 moon lift itself up, slowly, between the waste road over the hilltop,
 steadily, like a great bird. And he thought of the Bible, that the moon
 should be turned to blood. And the next day he made haste to be friends
 with Billy Pillins. And then the wild, intense games went on again under
 the lamp-post, surrounded by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her
 parlour, would hear the children singing away:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "My shoes are made of Spanish leather,
 My socks are made of silk;
 I wear a ring on every finger,
 I wash myself in milk."
</pre>
 <p>
 They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came out of
 the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing. It stirred
 the mother; and she understood when they came in at eight o'clock, ruddy,
 with brilliant eyes, and quick, passionate speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They all loved the Scargill Street house for its openness, for the great
 scallop of the world it had in view. On summer evenings the women would
 stand against the field fence, gossiping, facing the west, watching the
 sunsets flare quickly out, till the Derbyshire hills ridged across the
 crimson far away, like the black crest of a newt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In this summer season the pits never turned full time, particularly the
 soft coal. Mrs. Dakin, who lived next door to Mrs. Morel, going to the
 field fence to shake her hearthrug, would spy men coming slowly up the
 hill. She saw at once they were colliers. Then she waited, a tall, thin,
 shrew-faced woman, standing on the hill brow, almost like a menace to the
 poor colliers who were toiling up. It was only eleven o'clock. From the
 far-off wooded hills the haze that hangs like fine black crape at the back
 of a summer morning had not yet dissipated. The first man came to the
 stile. "Chock-chock!" went the gate under his thrust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, han' yer knocked off?" cried Mrs. Dakin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We han, missis."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pity as they letn yer goo," she said sarcastically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is that," replied the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, you know you're flig to come up again," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the man went on. Mrs. Dakin, going up her yard, spied Mrs. Morel
 taking the ashes to the ash-pit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon Minton's knocked off, missis," she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it sickenin!" exclaimed Mrs. Morel in wrath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha! But I'n just seed Jont Hutchby."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They might as well have saved their shoe-leather," said Mrs. Morel. And
 both women went indoors disgusted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The colliers, their faces scarcely blackened, were trooping home again.
 Morel hated to go back. He loved the sunny morning. But he had gone to pit
 to work, and to be sent home again spoilt his temper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good gracious, at this time!" exclaimed his wife, as he entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I help it, woman?" he shouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I've not done half enough dinner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I'll eat my bit o' snap as I took with me," he bawled pathetically.
 He felt ignominious and sore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the children, coming home from school, would wonder to see their
 father eating with his dinner the two thick slices of rather dry and dirty
 bread-and-butter that had been to pit and back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's my dad eating his snap for now?" asked Arthur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should ha'e it holled at me if I didna," snorted Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a story!" exclaimed his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' is it goin' to be wasted?" said Morel. "I'm not such a extravagant
 mortal as you lot, with your waste. If I drop a bit of bread at pit, in
 all the dust an' dirt, I pick it up an' eat it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The mice would eat it," said Paul. "It wouldn't be wasted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good bread-an'-butter's not for mice, either," said Morel. "Dirty or not
 dirty, I'd eat it rather than it should be wasted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You might leave it for the mice and pay for it out of your next pint,"
 said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, might I?" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were very poor that autumn. William had just gone away to London, and
 his mother missed his money. He sent ten shillings once or twice, but he
 had many things to pay for at first. His letters came regularly once a
 week. He wrote a good deal to his mother, telling her all his life, how he
 made friends, and was exchanging lessons with a Frenchman, how he enjoyed
 London. His mother felt again he was remaining to her just as when he was
 at home. She wrote to him every week her direct, rather witty letters. All
 day long, as she cleaned the house, she thought of him. He was in London:
 he would do well. Almost, he was like her knight who wore HER favour in
 the battle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was coming at Christmas for five days. There had never been such
 preparations. Paul and Arthur scoured the land for holly and evergreens.
 Annie made the pretty paper hoops in the old-fashioned way. And there was
 unheard-of extravagance in the larder. Mrs. Morel made a big and
 magnificent cake. Then, feeling queenly, she showed Paul how to blanch
 almonds. He skinned the long nuts reverently, counting them all, to see
 not one was lost. It was said that eggs whisked better in a cold place. So
 the boy stood in the scullery, where the temperature was nearly at
 freezing-point, and whisked and whisked, and flew in excitement to his
 mother as the white of egg grew stiffer and more snowy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just look, mother! Isn't it lovely?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he balanced a bit on his nose, then blew it in the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, don't waste it," said the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody was mad with excitement. William was coming on Christmas Eve.
 Mrs. Morel surveyed her pantry. There was a big plum cake, and a rice
 cake, jam tarts, lemon tarts, and mince-pies?two enormous dishes.
 She was finishing cooking?Spanish tarts and cheese-cakes. Everywhere
 was decorated. The kissing bunch of berried holly hung with bright and
 glittering things, spun slowly over Mrs. Morel's head as she trimmed her
 little tarts in the kitchen. A great fire roared. There was a scent of
 cooked pastry. He was due at seven o'clock, but he would be late. The
 three children had gone to meet him. She was alone. But at a quarter to
 seven Morel came in again. Neither wife nor husband spoke. He sat in his
 armchair, quite awkward with excitement, and she quietly went on with her
 baking. Only by the careful way in which she did things could it be told
 how much moved she was. The clock ticked on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What time dost say he's coming?" Morel asked for the fifth time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The train gets in at half-past six," she replied emphatically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then he'll be here at ten past seven."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, bless you, it'll be hours late on the Midland," she said
 indifferently. But she hoped, by expecting him late, to bring him early.
 Morel went down the entry to look for him. Then he came back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness, man!" she said. "You're like an ill-sitting hen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hadna you better be gettin' him summat t' eat ready?" asked the father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's plenty of time," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's not so much as I can see on," he answered, turning crossly in his
 chair. She began to clear her table. The kettle was singing. They waited
 and waited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meantime the three children were on the platform at Sethley Bridge, on the
 Midland main line, two miles from home. They waited one hour. A train came?he
 was not there. Down the line the red and green lights shone. It was very
 dark and very cold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ask him if the London train's come," said Paul to Annie, when they saw a
 man in a tip cap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not," said Annie. "You be quiet?he might send us off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Paul was dying for the man to know they were expecting someone by the
 London train: it sounded so grand. Yet he was much too much scared of
 broaching any man, let alone one in a peaked cap, to dare to ask. The
 three children could scarcely go into the waiting-room for fear of being
 sent away, and for fear something should happen whilst they were off the
 platform. Still they waited in the dark and cold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's an hour an' a half late," said Arthur pathetically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Annie, "it's Christmas Eve."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They all grew silent. He wasn't coming. They looked down the darkness of
 the railway. There was London! It seemed the utter-most of distance. They
 thought anything might happen if one came from London. They were all too
 troubled to talk. Cold, and unhappy, and silent, they huddled together on
 the platform.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, after more than two hours, they saw the lights of an engine
 peering round, away down the darkness. A porter ran out. The children drew
 back with beating hearts. A great train, bound for Manchester, drew up.
 Two doors opened, and from one of them, William. They flew to him. He
 handed parcels to them cheerily, and immediately began to explain that
 this great train had stopped for HIS sake at such a small station as
 Sethley Bridge: it was not booked to stop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile the parents were getting anxious. The table was set, the chop
 was cooked, everything was ready. Mrs. Morel put on her black apron. She
 was wearing her best dress. Then she sat, pretending to read. The minutes
 were a torture to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!" said Morel. "It's an hour an' a ha'ef."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And those children waiting!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' train canna ha' come in yet," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell you, on Christmas Eve they're HOURS wrong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were both a bit cross with each other, so gnawed with anxiety. The
 ash tree moaned outside in a cold, raw wind. And all that space of night
 from London home! Mrs. Morel suffered. The slight click of the works
 inside the clock irritated her. It was getting so late; it was getting
 unbearable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last there was a sound of voices, and a footstep in the entry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha's here!" cried Morel, jumping up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he stood back. The mother ran a few steps towards the door and
 waited. There was a rush and a patter of feet, the door burst open.
 William was there. He dropped his Gladstone bag and took his mother in his
 arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mater!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My boy!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And for two seconds, no longer, she clasped him and kissed him. Then she
 withdrew and said, trying to be quite normal:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how late you are!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't I!" he cried, turning to his father. "Well, dad!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two men shook hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, my lad!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel's eyes were wet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We thought tha'd niver be commin'," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'd come!" exclaimed William.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the son turned round to his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you look well," she said proudly, laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" he exclaimed. "I should think so?coming home!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a fine fellow, big, straight, and fearless-looking. He looked round
 at the evergreens and the kissing bunch, and the little tarts that lay in
 their tins on the hearth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By jove! mother, it's not different!" he said, as if in relief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody was still for a second. Then he suddenly sprang forward, picked
 a tart from the hearth, and pushed it whole into his mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, did iver you see such a parish oven!" the father exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had brought them endless presents. Every penny he had he had spent on
 them. There was a sense of luxury overflowing in the house. For his mother
 there was an umbrella with gold on the pale handle. She kept it to her
 dying day, and would have lost anything rather than that. Everybody had
 something gorgeous, and besides, there were pounds of unknown sweets:
 Turkish delight, crystallised pineapple, and such-like things which, the
 children thought, only the splendour of London could provide. And Paul
 boasted of these sweets among his friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Real pineapple, cut off in slices, and then turned into crystal?fair
 grand!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody was mad with happiness in the family. Home was home, and they
 loved it with a passion of love, whatever the suffering had been. There
 were parties, there were rejoicings. People came in to see William, to see
 what difference London had made to him. And they all found him "such a
 gentleman, and SUCH a fine fellow, my word"!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he went away again the children retired to various places to weep
 alone. Morel went to bed in misery, and Mrs. Morel felt as if she were
 numbed by some drug, as if her feelings were paralysed. She loved him
 passionately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was in the office of a lawyer connected with a large shipping firm, and
 at the midsummer his chief offered him a trip in the Mediterranean on one
 of the boats, for quite a small cost. Mrs. Morel wrote: "Go, go, my boy.
 You may never have a chance again, and I should love to think of you
 cruising there in the Mediterranean almost better than to have you at
 home." But William came home for his fortnight's holiday. Not even the
 Mediterranean, which pulled at all his young man's desire to travel, and
 at his poor man's wonder at the glamorous south, could take him away when
 he might come home. That compensated his mother for much.

 CHAPTER V
 </h2>
 <h3>
 PAUL LAUNCHES INTO LIFE
 </h3>
 <p>
 MOREL was rather a heedless man, careless of danger. So he had endless
 accidents. Now, when Mrs. Morel heard the rattle of an empty coal-cart
 cease at her entry-end, she ran into the parlour to look, expecting almost
 to see her husband seated in the waggon, his face grey under his dirt, his
 body limp and sick with some hurt or other. If it were he, she would run
 out to help.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 About a year after William went to London, and just after Paul had left
 school, before he got work, Mrs. Morel was upstairs and her son was
 painting in the kitchen?he was very clever with his brush?when
 there came a knock at the door. Crossly he put down his brush to go. At
 the same moment his mother opened a window upstairs and looked down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Mrs. Morel. "What is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she had guessed already.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your mester's got hurt," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed. "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad. And what's
 he done this time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere. They ta'ein' 'im ter
 th' 'ospital."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good gracious me!" she exclaimed. "Eh, dear, what a one he is! There's
 not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is! His thumb's nearly
 better, and now?Did you see him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I seed him at th' bottom. An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in a tub, an' 'e
 wor in a dead faint. But he shouted like anythink when Doctor Fraser
 examined him i' th' lamp cabin?an' cossed an' swore, an' said as 'e
 wor goin' to be ta'en whoam?'e worn't goin' ter th' 'ospital."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy faltered to an end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He WOULD want to come home, so that I can have all the bother. Thank you,
 my lad. Eh, dear, if I'm not sick?sick and surfeited, I am!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came downstairs. Paul had mechanically resumed his painting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital," she went
 on. "But what a CARELESS creature he is! OTHER men don't have all these
 accidents. Yes, he WOULD want to put all the burden on me. Eh, dear, just
 as we WERE getting easy a bit at last. Put those things away, there's no
 time to be painting now. What time is there a train? I know I s'll have to
 go trailing to Keston. I s'll have to leave that bedroom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can finish it," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You needn't. I shall catch the seven o'clock back, I should think. Oh, my
 blessed heart, the fuss and commotion he'll make! And those granite setts
 at Tinder Hill?he might well call them kidney pebbles?they'll
 jolt him almost to bits. I wonder why they can't mend them, the state
 they're in, an' all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think
 they'd have a hospital here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs,
 there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must trail them
 ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a crying shame! Oh, and
 the fuss he'll make! I know he will! I wonder who's with him. Barker, I
 s'd think. Poor beggar, he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look
 after him, I know. Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that
 hospital?and WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so
 bad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the time she was getting ready. Hurriedly taking off her bodice, she
 crouched at the boiler while the water ran slowly into her lading-can.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,
 wriggling the handle impatiently. She had very handsome, strong arms,
 rather surprising on a smallish woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said. "You've time enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel as she wiped
 her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you have. You must drink a cup of tea at any rate. Should I come
 with you to Keston?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what have I to take
 him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt?and it's a blessing it IS clean. But
 it had better be aired. And stockings?he won't want them?and a
 towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs. Now what else?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul. His father had been in
 the hospital before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in," continued Mrs.
 Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was fine as silk, and was
 touched now with grey. "He's very particular to wash himself to the waist,
 but below he thinks doesn't matter. But there, I suppose they see plenty
 like it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul had laid the table. He cut his mother one or two pieces of very thin
 bread and butter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready," he insisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence. She was
 thinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles to Keston
 Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her bulging string
 bag. Paul watched her go up the road between the hedges?a little,
 quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her, that she was thrust
 forward again into pain and trouble. And she, tripping so quickly in her
 anxiety, felt at the back of her her son's heart waiting on her, felt him
 bearing what part of the burden he could, even supporting her. And when
 she was at the hospital, she thought: "It WILL upset that lad when I tell
 him how bad it is. I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home
 again, she felt he was coming to share her burden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's bad enough," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son watched her
 face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened hands fingering at the
 bow under her chin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse says it's
 a dreadful smash. You see, a great piece of rock fell on his leg?here?and
 it's a compound fracture. There are pieces of bone sticking through?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ugh?how horrid!" exclaimed the children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die?it
 wouldn't be him if he didn't. 'I'm done for, my lass!' he said, looking at
 me. 'Don't be so silly,' I said to him. 'You're not going to die of a
 broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver come out of 'ere
 but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said, 'if you want them to
 carry you into the garden in a wooden box, when you're better, I've no
 doubt they will.' 'If we think it's good for him,' said the Sister. She's
 an awfully nice Sister, but rather strict."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet. The children waited in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course, he IS bad," she continued, "and he will be. It's a great
 shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course, it IS a very
 dangerous smash. It's not at all sure that it will mend so easily. And
 then there's the fever and the mortification?if it took bad ways
 he'd quickly be gone. But there, he's a clean-blooded man, with wonderful
 healing flesh, and so I see no reason why it SHOULD take bad ways. Of
 course there's a wound?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was pale now with emotion and anxiety. The three children realised
 that it was very bad for their father, and the house was silent, anxious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's what I tell him," said the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody moved about in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And he really looked nearly done for," she said. "But the Sister says
 that is the pain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll have to go now,
 Walter, because of the train?and the children.' And he looked at me.
 It seems hard."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul took up his brush again and went on painting. Arthur went outside for
 some coal. Annie sat looking dismal. And Mrs. Morel, in her little
 rocking-chair that her husband had made for her when the first baby was
 coming, remained motionless, brooding. She was grieved, and bitterly sorry
 for the man who was hurt so much. But still, in her heart of hearts, where
 the love should have burned, there was a blank. Now, when all her woman's
 pity was roused to its full extent, when she would have slaved herself to
 death to nurse him and to save him, when she would have taken the pain
 herself, if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she felt indifferent
 to him and to his suffering. It hurt her most of all, this failure to love
 him, even when he roused her strong emotions. She brooded a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got halfway to Keston, I found
 I'd come out in my working boots?and LOOK at them." They were an old
 pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed through at the toes. "I didn't know what
 to do with myself, for shame," she added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs. Morel talked
 again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I found Barker at the hospital. He did look bad, poor little fellow!
 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a journey did you have with him?'
 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said. 'Ay,' I said, 'I know what he'd be.' 'But
 it WOR bad for him, Mrs. Morel, it WOR that!' he said. 'I know,' I said.
 'At ivry jolt I thought my 'eart would ha' flown clean out o' my mouth,'
 he said. 'An' the scream 'e gives sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune
 would I go through wi' it again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.
 'It's a nasty job, though,' he said, 'an' one as'll be a long while afore
 it's right again.' 'I'm afraid it will,' I said. I like Mr. Barker?I
 DO like him. There's something so manly about him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul resumed his task silently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your father, the
 hospital IS hard. He CAN'T understand rules and regulations. And he won't
 let anybody else touch him, not if he can help it. When he smashed the
 muscles of his thigh, and it had to be dressed four times a day, WOULD he
 let anybody but me or his mother do it? He wouldn't. So, of course, he'll
 suffer in there with the nurses. And I didn't like leaving him. I'm sure,
 when I kissed him an' came away, it seemed a shame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking aloud to him, and
 he took it in as best he could, by sharing her trouble to lighten it. And
 in the end she shared almost everything with him without knowing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel had a very bad time. For a week he was in a critical condition. Then
 he began to mend. And then, knowing he was going to get better, the whole
 family sighed with relief, and proceeded to live happily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital. There were
 fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings from the sick club,
 and five shillings from the Disability Fund; and then every week the
 butties had something for Mrs. Morel?five or seven shillings?so
 that she was quite well to do. And whilst Morel was progressing favourably
 in the hospital, the family was extraordinarily happy and peaceful. On
 Saturdays and Wednesdays Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband.
 Then she always brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for
 Paul, or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the whole
 family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send them
 away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty wood. She described her
 adventures into the big shops with joy. Soon the folk in the picture-shop
 knew her, and knew about Paul. The girl in the book-shop took a keen
 interest in her. Mrs. Morel was full of information when she got home from
 Nottingham. The three sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in,
 arguing. Then Paul often raked the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother with joy.
 They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be. And they almost
 regretted?though none of them would have owned to such callousness?that
 their father was soon coming back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work. He was a rather small and
 rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and light blue eyes. His face
 had already lost its youthful chubbiness, and was becoming somewhat like
 William's?rough-featured, almost rugged?and it was
 extraordinarily mobile. Usually he looked as if he saw things, was full of
 life, and warm; then his smile, like his mother's, came suddenly and was
 very lovable; and then, when there was any clog in his soul's quick
 running, his face went stupid and ugly. He was the sort of boy that
 becomes a clown and a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels
 himself held cheap; and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He suffered very much from the first contact with anything. When he was
 seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and a torture to him. But
 afterwards he liked it. And now that he felt he had to go out into life,
 he went through agonies of shrinking self-consciousness. He was quite a
 clever painter for a boy of his years, and he knew some French and German
 and mathematics that Mr. Heaton had taught him. But nothing he had was of
 any commercial value. He was not strong enough for heavy manual work, his
 mother said. He did not care for making things with his hands, preferred
 racing about, or making excursions into the country, or reading, or
 painting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you want to be?" his mother asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give. His ambition,
 as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn his thirty or
 thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home, and then, when his
 father died, have a cottage with his mother, paint and go out as he liked,
 and live happy ever after. That was his programme as far as doing things
 went. But he was proud within himself, measuring people against himself,
 and placing them, inexorably. And he thought that PERHAPS he might also
 make a painter, the real thing. But that he left alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper for the
 advertisements."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at her. It seemed to him a bitter humiliation and an anguish to
 go through. But he said nothing. When he got up in the morning, his whole
 being was knotted up over this one thought:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all joy and even
 life, for him. His heart felt like a tight knot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then, at ten o'clock, he set off. He was supposed to be a queer, quiet
 child. Going up the sunny street of the little town, he felt as if all the
 folk he met said to themselves: "He's going to the Co-op. reading-room to
 look in the papers for a place. He can't get a job. I suppose he's living
 on his mother." Then he crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop
 at the Co-op., and peeped in the reading-room. Usually one or two men were
 there, either old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club". So he
 entered, full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated
 himself at the table, and pretended to scan the news. He knew they would
 think: "What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with a
 newspaper?" and he suffered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he looked wistfully out of the window. Already he was a prisoner of
 industrialism. Large sunflowers stared over the old red wall of the garden
 opposite, looking in their jolly way down on the women who were hurrying
 with something for dinner. The valley was full of corn, brightening in the
 sun. Two collieries, among the fields, waved their small white plumes of
 steam. Far off on the hills were the woods of Annesley, dark and
 fascinating. Already his heart went down. He was being taken into bondage.
 His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous barrels,
 four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod. The waggoner, throned aloft,
 rolling massively in his seat, was not so much below Paul's eye. The man's
 hair, on his small, bullet head, was bleached almost white by the sun, and
 on his thick red arms, rocking idly on his sack apron, the white hairs
 glistened. His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine. The
 horses, handsome and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the
 masters of the show.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul wished he were stupid. "I wish," he thought to himself, "I was fat
 like him, and like a dog in the sun. I wish I was a pig and a brewer's
 waggoner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy an advertisement
 on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip out in immense relief. His
 mother would scan over his copies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said, "you may try."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William had written out a letter of application, couched in admirable
 business language, which Paul copied, with variations. The boy's
 handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did all things well, got
 into a fever of impatience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elder brother was becoming quite swanky. In London he found that he
 could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends in station. Some
 of the clerks in the office had studied for the law, and were more or less
 going through a kind of apprenticeship. William always made friends among
 men wherever he went, he was so jolly. Therefore he was soon visiting and
 staying in houses of men who, in Bestwood, would have looked down on the
 unapproachable bank manager, and would merely have called indifferently on
 the Rector. So he began to fancy himself as a great gun. He was, indeed,
 rather surprised at the ease with which he became a gentleman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased. And his lodging in Walthamstow
 was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind of fever into the young
 man's letters. He was unsettled by all the change, he did not stand firm
 on his own feet, but seemed to spin rather giddily on the quick current of
 the new life. His mother was anxious for him. She could feel him losing
 himself. He had danced and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been
 out with friends; and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom
 grinding away at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and
 in the law as much as he could. He never sent his mother any money now. It
 was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she did not want
 any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner, and when ten
 shillings would have saved her much worry. She still dreamed of William,
 and of what he would do, with herself behind him. Never for a minute would
 she admit to herself how heavy and anxious her heart was because of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance, a handsome
 brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men were running thick
 and fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote to him, "unless you
 saw all the other men chasing her too. You feel safe enough and vain
 enough in a crowd. But take care, and see how you feel when you find
 yourself alone, and in triumph." William resented these things, and
 continued the chase. He had taken the girl on the river. "If you saw her,
 mother, you would know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of
 clear, transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such grey
 eyes?bright, mocking, like lights on water at night. It is all very
 well to be a bit satirical till you see her. And she dresses as well as
 any woman in London. I tell you, your son doesn't half put his head up
 when she goes walking down Piccadilly with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go walking down
 Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes, rather than with a
 woman who was near to him. But she congratulated him in her doubtful
 fashion. And, as she stood over the washing-tub, the mother brooded over
 her son. She saw him saddled with an elegant and expensive wife, earning
 little money, dragging along and getting draggled in some small, ugly
 house in a suburb. "But there," she told herself, "I am very likely a
 silly?meeting trouble halfway." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety
 scarcely ever left her heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan, Manufacturer of
 Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham. Mrs. Morel was all
 joy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining. "You've only written four
 letters, and the third is answered. You're lucky, my boy, as I always said
 you were."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic stockings
 and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's notepaper, and he felt
 alarmed. He had not known that elastic stockings existed. And he seemed to
 feel the business world, with its regulated system of values, and its
 impersonality, and he dreaded it. It seemed monstrous also that a business
 could be run on wooden legs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning. It was August and
 blazing hot. Paul walked with something screwed up tight inside him. He
 would have suffered much physical pain rather than this unreasonable
 suffering at being exposed to strangers, to be accepted or rejected. Yet
 he chattered away with his mother. He would never have confessed to her
 how he suffered over these things, and she only partly guessed. She was
 gay, like a sweetheart. She stood in front of the ticket-office at
 Bestwood, and Paul watched her take from her purse the money for the
 tickets. As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting the
 silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain of love of
 her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was quite excited, and quite gay. He suffered because she WOULD talk
 aloud in presence of the other travellers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round as if it thought
 it was a circus."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They thought a while. He was sensible all the time of having her opposite
 him. Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to him?a rare, intimate
 smile, beautiful with brightness and love. Then each looked out of the
 window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed. The mother and son
 walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers having an
 adventure together. In Carrington Street they stopped to hang over the
 parapet and look at the barges on the canal below.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine on the water that
 lay between high factory walls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps," she answered, smiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They enjoyed the shops immensely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just suit our
 Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three. Isn't that cheap?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And made of needlework as well," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. The town was strange and
 delightful to them. But the boy was tied up inside in a knot of
 apprehension. He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church. They turned up a
 narrow street that led to the Castle. It was gloomy and old-fashioned,
 having low dark shops and dark green house doors with brass knockers, and
 yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting on to the pavement; then another old
 shop whose small window looked like a cunning, half-shut eye. Mother and
 son went cautiously, looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son". It
 was like hunting in some wild place. They were on tiptoe of excitement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names of various
 firms, Thomas Jordan among them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel. "But now WHERE is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They looked round. On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory, on
 the other a Commercial Hotel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's up the entry," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws of the dragon. They
 emerged into a wide yard, like a well, with buildings all round. It was
 littered with straw and boxes, and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught
 one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold. But
 elsewhere the place was like a pit. There were several doors, and two
 flights of steps. Straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a
 staircase, loomed the ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son?Surgical
 Appliances." Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her. Charles I
 mounted his scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he
 followed his mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. In front of her
 was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere, and clerks,
 with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about in an at-home sort
 of way. The light was subdued, the glossy cream parcels seemed luminous,
 the counters were of dark brown wood. All was quiet and very homely. Mrs.
 Morel took two steps forward, then waited. Paul stood behind her. She had
 on her Sunday bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white collar
 and a Norfolk suit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the clerks looked up. He was thin and tall, with a small face. His
 way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round to the other end of the
 room, where was a glass office. And then he came forward. He did not say
 anything, but leaned in a gentle, inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll fetch him," answered the young man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went down to the glass office. A red-faced, white-whiskered old man
 looked up. He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog. Then the same little man
 came up the room. He had short legs, was rather stout, and wore an alpaca
 jacket. So, with one ear up, as it were, he came stoutly and inquiringly
 down the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel, in doubt as to
 whether she were a customer or not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning. I came with my son, Paul Morel. You asked him to call this
 morning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little manner
 intended to be businesslike.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room, upholstered in
 black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of many customers. On the
 table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather hoops tangled together.
 They looked new and living. Paul sniffed the odour of new wash-leather. He
 wondered what the things were. By this time he was so much stunned that he
 only noticed the outside things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel to a horse-hair
 chair. She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion. Then the little old
 man fidgeted and found a paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul recognised as
 his own notepaper in front of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling guilty for
 telling a lie, since William had composed the letter; second, in wondering
 why his letter seemed so strange and different, in the fat, red hand of
 the man, from what it had been when it lay on the kitchen table. It was
 like part of himself, gone astray. He resented the way the man held it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He IS a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically. Then she pushed up
 her veil. Paul hated her for not being prouder with this common little
 man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you say you know French?" inquired the little man, still sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What school did you go to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Board-school."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And did you learn it there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?I?" The boy went crimson and got no farther.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half pleading and
 rather distant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jordan hesitated. Then, in his irritable manner?he always seemed
 to keep his hands ready for action?he pulled another sheet of paper
 from his pocket, unfolded it. The paper made a crackling noise. He handed
 it to Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Read that," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting that the boy
 could not decipher. He stared blankly at the paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Monsieur,'" he began; then he looked in great confusion at Mr. Jordan.
 "It's the?it's the?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work even
 sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool, and
 hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Sir,?Please send me'?er?er?I can't tell the?er?'two
 pairs?gris fil bas?grey thread stockings'?er?er?'sans?without'?er?I
 can't tell the words?er?'doigts?fingers'?er?I
 can't tell the?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused to come. Seeing
 him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings without TOES.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'?as well?as a
 rule?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts" meant
 "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him. Mr. Jordan looked at
 the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother, who sat quiet and with
 that peculiar shut-off look of the poor who have to depend on the favour
 of others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And when could he come?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished school
 now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He would live in Bestwood?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; but he could be in?at the station?at quarter to eight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight shillings
 a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another word, after having
 insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He followed his mother down the
 stairs. She looked at him with her bright blue eyes full of love and joy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think you'll like it," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing. I couldn't
 read the writing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you won't see much
 of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice? I'm sure you'll like them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said. "You mustn't mind
 people so much. They're not being disagreeable to YOU?it's their
 way. You always think people are meaning things for you. But they don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place the
 blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened. Shops
 down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full of
 colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market was a row of
 fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun?apples and piles of
 reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas. There was a warm
 scent of fruit as mother and son passed. Gradually his feeling of ignominy
 and of rage sank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only been in an
 eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only to have a cup of tea
 and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood considered that tea and
 bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef, was all they could afford to
 eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner was considered great extravagance.
 Paul felt rather guilty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel scanned
 the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear. So she ordered
 kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he liked sweets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress was busy, and Mrs.
 Morel did not like to bother her then. So the mother and son waited for
 the girl's pleasure, whilst she flirted among the men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now, she's taking that man
 HIS pudding, and he came long after us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders were too
 meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her rights just then.
 They waited and waited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Should we go, mother?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl looked round insolently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Directly," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel asked coldly for
 the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor. He marvelled at his
 mother's hardness. He knew that only years of battling had taught her to
 insist even so little on her rights. She shrank as much as he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared, when they were
 outside the place, thankful to be clear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one or two
 places, shall we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel wanted to buy him a
 little sable brush that he hankered after. But this indulgence he refused.
 He stood in front of milliners' shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but
 content for her to be interested. They wandered on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make your mouth
 water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll have to wait a bit
 before I get them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady in black
 peering over the counter curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's a tubful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So there is?red and white. But really, I never knew stocks to smell
 like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved out of the doorway, but only
 to stand in front of the window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of sight of the
 elegant young lady in black?the shop-girl. "Paul! Just look here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came reluctantly back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think every second as
 the flowers was going to fall off, they hang so big an' heavy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And such an abundance!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would die in our parlour."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant you put
 in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They bought a few things, and set off towards the station. Looking up the
 canal, through the dark pass of the buildings, they saw the Castle on its
 bluff of brown, green-bushed rock, in a positive miracle of delicate
 sunshine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul. "I can
 go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will," assented his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived home in the
 mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket and took it to
 the station. When he got back, his mother was just beginning to wash the
 floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how much will it be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About one pound eleven," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went on washing her floor in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it a lot?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's no more than I thought," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give me a pound
 a month. He has given me ten shillings?twice; and now I know he
 hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it. Only just now you'd
 think he might be able to help with this ticket, which I'd never
 expected."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He earns a lot," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike. They're
 large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment you get."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied; "and am supposed
 to find money for extras. But they don't care about helping you, once
 they've gone. He'd rather spend it on that dressed-up creature."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he doesn't buy her a
 gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought ME a gold bangle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her. He asked the
 girl?her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western?for a photograph
 to send to his mother. The photo came?a handsome brunette, taken in
 profile, smirking slightly?and, it might be, quite naked, for on the
 photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen, only a naked bust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of Louie is very
 striking, and I can see she must be attractive. But do you think, my boy,
 it was very good taste of a girl to give her young man that photo to send
 to his mother?the first? Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as
 you say. But I hardly expected to see so much of them at the first view."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in the parlour. He
 came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an' one as wunna do him
 owermuch good neither. Who is she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er an actress?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady, is she? An'
 how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o' game on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates, and takes what
 bit of money's given her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's a fool to ha'
 ta'en up wi' such a one as that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like the photograph.
 It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you mightn't think it decent.
 However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite suit your prim and proper
 notions, so she's going to send you another, that I hope will please you
 better. She's always being photographed; in fact, the photographers ask
 her if they may take her for nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note from the girl.
 This time the young lady was seen in a black satin evening bodice, cut
 square, with little puff sleeves, and black lace hanging down her
 beautiful arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes," said Mrs.
 Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first one with
 bare shoulders is lovely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work. He had the
 season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his waistcoat pocket. He
 loved it with its bars of yellow across. His mother packed his dinner in a
 small, shut-up basket, and he set off at a quarter to seven to catch the
 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came to the entry-end to see him off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender green fruits that
 the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily down on a little breeze,
 into the front gardens of the houses. The valley was full of a lustrous
 dark haze, through which the ripe corn shimmered, and in which the steam
 from Minton pit melted swiftly. Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the
 high woods of Aldersley, where the country gleamed, and home had never
 pulled at him so powerfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him as he crossed
 the field. He had a small, compact body that looked full of life. She
 felt, as she saw him trudging over the field, that where he determined to
 go he would get. She thought of William. He would have leaped the fence
 instead of going round the stile. He was away in London, doing well. Paul
 would be working in Nottingham. Now she had two sons in the world. She
 could think of two places, great centres of industry, and feel that she
 had put a man into each of them, that these men would work out what SHE
 wanted; they were derived from her, they were of her, and their works also
 would be hers. All the morning long she thought of Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At eight o'clock he climbed the dismal stairs of Jordan's Surgical
 Appliance Factory, and stood helplessly against the first great
 parcel-rack, waiting for somebody to pick him up. The place was still not
 awake. Over the counters were great dust sheets. Two men only had arrived,
 and were heard talking in a corner, as they took off their coats and
 rolled up their shirt-sleeves. It was ten past eight. Evidently there was
 no rush of punctuality. Paul listened to the voices of the two clerks.
 Then he heard someone cough, and saw in the office at the end of the room
 an old, decaying clerk, in a round smoking-cap of black velvet embroidered
 with red and green, opening letters. He waited and waited. One of the
 junior clerks went to the old man, greeted him cheerily and loudly.
 Evidently the old "chief" was deaf. Then the young fellow came striding
 importantly down to his counter. He spied Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" he said. "You the new lad?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm! What's your name?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul Morel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul Morel? All right, you come on round here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul followed him round the rectangle of counters. The room was second
 storey. It had a great hole in the middle of the floor, fenced as with a
 wall of counters, and down this wide shaft the lifts went, and the light
 for the bottom storey. Also there was a corresponding big, oblong hole in
 the ceiling, and one could see above, over the fence of the top floor,
 some machinery; and right away overhead was the glass roof, and all light
 for the three storeys came downwards, getting dimmer, so that it was
 always night on the ground floor and rather gloomy on the second floor.
 The factory was the top floor, the warehouse the second, the storehouse
 the ground floor. It was an insanitary, ancient place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was led round to a very dark corner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is the 'Spiral' corner," said the clerk. "You're Spiral, with
 Pappleworth. He's your boss, but he's not come yet. He doesn't get here
 till half-past eight. So you can fetch the letters, if you like, from Mr.
 Melling down there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young man pointed to the old clerk in the office.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's a peg to hang your cap on. Here are your entry ledgers. Mr.
 Pappleworth won't be long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the thin young man stalked away with long, busy strides over the
 hollow wooden floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a minute or two Paul went down and stood in the door of the glass
 office. The old clerk in the smoking-cap looked down over the rim of his
 spectacles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning," he said, kindly and impressively. "You want the letters
 for the Spiral department, Thomas?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul resented being called "Thomas". But he took the letters and returned
 to his dark place, where the counter made an angle, where the great
 parcel-rack came to an end, and where there were three doors in the
 corner. He sat on a high stool and read the letters?those whose
 handwriting was not too difficult. They ran as follows:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you please send me at once a pair of lady's silk spiral thigh-hose,
 without feet, such as I had from you last year; length, thigh to knee,
 etc." Or, "Major Chamberlain wishes to repeat his previous order for a
 silk non-elastic suspensory bandage."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Many of these letters, some of them in French or Norwegian, were a great
 puzzle to the boy. He sat on his stool nervously awaiting the arrival of
 his "boss". He suffered tortures of shyness when, at half-past eight, the
 factory girls for upstairs trooped past him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pappleworth arrived, chewing a chlorodyne gum, at about twenty to
 nine, when all the other men were at work. He was a thin, sallow man with
 a red nose, quick, staccato, and smartly but stiffly dressed. He was about
 thirty-six years old. There was something rather "doggy", rather smart,
 rather 'cute and shrewd, and something warm, and something slightly
 contemptible about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You my new lad?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul stood up and said he was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fetched the letters?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pappleworth gave a chew to his gum.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Copied 'em?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, come on then, let's look slippy. Changed your coat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You want to bring an old coat and leave it here." He pronounced the last
 words with the chlorodyne gum between his side teeth. He vanished into the
 darkness behind the great parcel-rack, reappeared coatless, turning up a
 smart striped shirt-cuff over a thin and hairy arm. Then he slipped into
 his coat. Paul noticed how thin he was, and that his trousers were in
 folds behind. He seized a stool, dragged it beside the boy's, and sat
 down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sit down," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul took a seat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pappleworth was very close to him. The man seized the letters,
 snatched a long entry-book out of a rack in front of him, flung it open,
 seized a pen, and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now look here. You want to copy these letters in here." He sniffed twice,
 gave a quick chew at his gum, stared fixedly at a letter, then went very
 still and absorbed, and wrote the entry rapidly, in a beautiful
 flourishing hand. He glanced quickly at Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Think you can do it all right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right then, let's see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sprang off his stool. Paul took a pen. Mr. Pappleworth disappeared.
 Paul rather liked copying the letters, but he wrote slowly, laboriously,
 and exceedingly badly. He was doing the fourth letter, and feeling quite
 busy and happy, when Mr. Pappleworth reappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now then, how'r' yer getting on? Done 'em?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He leaned over the boy's shoulder, chewing, and smelling of chlorodyne.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Strike my bob, lad, but you're a beautiful writer!" he exclaimed
 satirically. "Ne'er mind, how many h'yer done? Only three! I'd 'a eaten
 'em. Get on, my lad, an' put numbers on 'em. Here, look! Get on!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul ground away at the letters, whilst Mr. Pappleworth fussed over
 various jobs. Suddenly the boy started as a shrill whistle sounded near
 his ear. Mr. Pappleworth came, took a plug out of a pipe, and said, in an
 amazingly cross and bossy voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul heard a faint voice, like a woman's, out of the mouth of the tube. He
 gazed in wonder, never having seen a speaking-tube before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mr. Pappleworth disagreeably into the tube, "you'd better get
 some of your back work done, then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again the woman's tiny voice was heard, sounding pretty and cross.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've not time to stand here while you talk," said Mr. Pappleworth, and he
 pushed the plug into the tube.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, my lad," he said imploringly to Paul, "there's Polly crying out for
 them orders. Can't you buck up a bit? Here, come out!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the book, to Paul's immense chagrin, and began the copying
 himself. He worked quickly and well. This done, he seized some strips of
 long yellow paper, about three inches wide, and made out the day's orders
 for the work-girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd better watch me," he said to Paul, working all the while rapidly.
 Paul watched the weird little drawings of legs, and thighs, and ankles,
 with the strokes across and the numbers, and the few brief directions
 which his chief made upon the yellow paper. Then Mr. Pappleworth finished
 and jumped up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on with me," he said, and the yellow papers flying in his hands, he
 dashed through a door and down some stairs, into the basement where the
 gas was burning. They crossed the cold, damp storeroom, then a long,
 dreary room with a long table on trestles, into a smaller, cosy apartment,
 not very high, which had been built on to the main building. In this room
 a small woman with a red serge blouse, and her black hair done on top of
 her head, was waiting like a proud little bantam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here y'are!" said Pappleworth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think it is 'here you are'!" exclaimed Polly. "The girls have been here
 nearly half an hour waiting. Just think of the time wasted!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "YOU think of getting your work done and not talking so much," said Mr.
 Pappleworth. "You could ha' been finishing off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know quite well we finished everything off on Saturday!" cried Pony,
 flying at him, her dark eyes flashing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tu-tu-tu-tu-terterter!" he mocked. "Here's your new lad. Don't ruin him
 as you did the last."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As we did the last!" repeated Polly. "Yes, WE do a lot of ruining, we do.
 My word, a lad would TAKE some ruining after he'd been with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's time for work now, not for talk," said Mr. Pappleworth severely and
 coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was time for work some time back," said Polly, marching away with her
 head in the air. She was an erect little body of forty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In that room were two round spiral machines on the bench under the window.
 Through the inner doorway was another longer room, with six more machines.
 A little group of girls, nicely dressed in white aprons, stood talking
 together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you nothing else to do but talk?" said Mr. Pappleworth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only wait for you," said one handsome girl, laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, get on, get on," he said. "Come on, my lad. You'll know your road
 down here again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Paul ran upstairs after his chief. He was given some checking and
 invoicing to do. He stood at the desk, labouring in his execrable
 handwriting. Presently Mr. Jordan came strutting down from the glass
 office and stood behind him, to the boy's great discomfort. Suddenly a red
 and fat finger was thrust on the form he was filling in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "MR. J. A. Bates, Esquire!" exclaimed the cross voice just behind his ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul looked at "Mr. J. A. Bates, Esquire" in his own vile writing, and
 wondered what was the matter now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't they teach you any better THAN that while they were at it? If you
 put 'Mr.' you don't put Esquire'-a man can't be both at once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy regretted his too-much generosity in disposing of honours,
 hesitated, and with trembling fingers, scratched out the "Mr." Then all at
 once Mr. Jordan snatched away the invoice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Make another! Are you going to send that to a gentleman?" And he tore up
 the blue form irritably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul, his ears red with shame, began again. Still Mr. Jordan watched.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what they DO teach in schools. You'll have to write better
 than that. Lads learn nothing nowadays, but how to recite poetry and play
 the fiddle. Have you seen his writing?" he asked of Mr. Pappleworth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; prime, isn't it?" replied Mr. Pappleworth indifferently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jordan gave a little grunt, not unamiable. Paul divined that his
 master's bark was worse than his bite. Indeed, the little manufacturer,
 although he spoke bad English, was quite gentleman enough to leave his men
 alone and to take no notice of trifles. But he knew he did not look like
 the boss and owner of the show, so he had to play his role of proprietor
 at first, to put things on a right footing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's see, WHAT'S your name?" asked Mr. Pappleworth of the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul Morel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is curious that children suffer so much at having to pronounce their
 own names.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul Morel, is it? All right, you Paul-Morel through them things there,
 and then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pappleworth subsided on to a stool, and began writing. A girl came up
 from out of a door just behind, put some newly-pressed elastic web
 appliances on the counter, and returned. Mr. Pappleworth picked up the
 whitey-blue knee-band, examined it, and its yellow order-paper quickly,
 and put it on one side. Next was a flesh-pink "leg". He went through the
 few things, wrote out a couple of orders, and called to Paul to accompany
 him. This time they went through the door whence the girl had emerged.
 There Paul found himself at the top of a little wooden flight of steps,
 and below him saw a room with windows round two sides, and at the farther
 end half a dozen girls sitting bending over the benches in the light from
 the window, sewing. They were singing together "Two Little Girls in Blue".
 Hearing the door opened, they all turned round, to see Mr. Pappleworth and
 Paul looking down on them from the far end of the room. They stopped
 singing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't you make a bit less row?" said Mr. Pappleworth. "Folk'll think we
 keep cats."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A hunchback woman on a high stool turned her long, rather heavy face
 towards Mr. Pappleworth, and said, in a contralto voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're all tom-cats then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In vain Mr. Pappleworth tried to be impressive for Paul's benefit. He
 descended the steps into the finishing-off room, and went to the hunchback
 Fanny. She had such a short body on her high stool that her head, with its
 great bands of bright brown hair, seemed over large, as did her pale,
 heavy face. She wore a dress of green-black cashmere, and her wrists,
 coming out of the narrow cuffs, were thin and flat, as she put down her
 work nervously. He showed her something that was wrong with a knee-cap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she said, "you needn't come blaming it on to me. It's not my
 fault." Her colour mounted to her cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never said it WAS your fault. Will you do as I tell you?" replied Mr.
 Pappleworth shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't say it's my fault, but you'd like to make out as it was," the
 hunchback woman cried, almost in tears. Then she snatched the knee-cap
 from her "boss", saying: "Yes, I'll do it for you, but you needn't be
 snappy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's your new lad," said Mr. Pappleworth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fanny turned, smiling very gently on Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; don't make a softy of him between you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not us as 'ud make a softy of him," she said indignantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on then, Paul," said Mr. Pappleworth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Au revoy, Paul," said one of the girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a titter of laughter. Paul went out, blushing deeply, not having
 spoken a word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The day was very long. All morning the work-people were coming to speak to
 Mr. Pappleworth. Paul was writing or learning to make up parcels, ready
 for the midday post. At one o'clock, or, rather, at a quarter to one, Mr.
 Pappleworth disappeared to catch his train: he lived in the suburbs. At
 one o'clock, Paul, feeling very lost, took his dinner-basket down into the
 stockroom in the basement, that had the long table on trestles, and ate
 his meal hurriedly, alone in that cellar of gloom and desolation. Then he
 went out of doors. The brightness and the freedom of the streets made him
 feel adventurous and happy. But at two o'clock he was back in the corner
 of the big room. Soon the work-girls went trooping past, making remarks.
 It was the commoner girls who worked upstairs at the heavy tasks of
 truss-making and the finishing of artificial limbs. He waited for Mr.
 Pappleworth, not knowing what to do, sitting scribbling on the yellow
 order-paper. Mr. Pappleworth came at twenty minutes to three. Then he sat
 and gossiped with Paul, treating the boy entirely as an equal, even in
 age.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the afternoon there was never very much to do, unless it were near the
 week-end, and the accounts had to be made up. At five o'clock all the men
 went down into the dungeon with the table on trestles, and there they had
 tea, eating bread-and-butter on the bare, dirty boards, talking with the
 same kind of ugly haste and slovenliness with which they ate their meal.
 And yet upstairs the atmosphere among them was always jolly and clear. The
 cellar and the trestles affected them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After tea, when all the gases were lighted, WORK went more briskly. There
 was the big evening post to get off. The hose came up warm and newly
 pressed from the workrooms. Paul had made out the invoices. Now he had the
 packing up and addressing to do, then he had to weigh his stock of parcels
 on the scales. Everywhere voices were calling weights, there was the chink
 of metal, the rapid snapping of string, the hurrying to old Mr. Melling
 for stamps. And at last the postman came with his sack, laughing and
 jolly. Then everything slacked off, and Paul took his dinner-basket and
 ran to the station to catch the eight-twenty train. The day in the factory
 was just twelve hours long.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother sat waiting for him rather anxiously. He had to walk from
 Keston, so was not home until about twenty past nine. And he left the
 house before seven in the morning. Mrs. Morel was rather anxious about his
 health. But she herself had had to put up with so much that she expected
 her children to take the same odds. They must go through with what came.
 And Paul stayed at Jordan's, although all the time he was there his health
 suffered from the darkness and lack of air and the long hours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came in pale and tired. His mother looked at him. She saw he was rather
 pleased, and her anxiety all went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and how was it?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ever so funny, mother," he replied. "You don't have to work a bit hard,
 and they're nice with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And did you get on all right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes: they only say my writing's bad. But Mr. Pappleworth?he's my
 man?said to Mr. Jordan I should be all right. I'm Spiral, mother;
 you must come and see. It's ever so nice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon he liked Jordan's. Mr. Pappleworth, who had a certain "saloon bar"
 flavour about him, was always natural, and treated him as if he had been a
 comrade. Sometimes the "Spiral boss" was irritable, and chewed more
 lozenges than ever. Even then, however, he was not offensive, but one of
 those people who hurt themselves by their own irritability more than they
 hurt other people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Haven't you done that YET?" he would cry. "Go on, be a month of Sundays."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again, and Paul could understand him least then, he was jocular and in
 high spirits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going to bring my little Yorkshire terrier bitch tomorrow," he said
 jubilantly to Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's a Yorkshire terrier?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "DON'T know what a Yorkshire terrier is? DON'T KNOW A YORKSHIRE?"
 Mr. Pappleworth was aghast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it a little silky one?colours of iron and rusty silver?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "THAT'S it, my lad. She's a gem. She's had five pounds' worth of pups
 already, and she's worth over seven pounds herself; and she doesn't weigh
 twenty ounces."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day the bitch came. She was a shivering, miserable morsel. Paul
 did not care for her; she seemed so like a wet rag that would never dry.
 Then a man called for her, and began to make coarse jokes. But Mr.
 Pappleworth nodded his head in the direction of the boy, and the talk went
 on <i>sotto voce</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jordan only made one more excursion to watch Paul, and then the only
 fault he found was seeing the boy lay his pen on the counter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Put your pen in your ear, if you're going to be a clerk. Pen in your
 ear!" And one day he said to the lad: "Why don't you hold your shoulders
 straighter? Come down here," when he took him into the glass office and
 fitted him with special braces for keeping the shoulders square.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Paul liked the girls best. The men seemed common and rather dull. He
 liked them all, but they were uninteresting. Polly, the little brisk
 overseer downstairs, finding Paul eating in the cellar, asked him if she
 could cook him anything on her little stove. Next day his mother gave him
 a dish that could be heated up. He took it into the pleasant, clean room
 to Polly. And very soon it grew to be an established custom that he should
 have dinner with her. When he came in at eight in the morning he took his
 basket to her, and when he came down at one o'clock she had his dinner
 ready.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was not very tall, and pale, with thick chestnut hair, irregular
 features, and a wide, full mouth. She was like a small bird. He often
 called her a "robinet". Though naturally rather quiet, he would sit and
 chatter with her for hours telling her about his home. The girls all liked
 to hear him talk. They often gathered in a little circle while he sat on a
 bench, and held forth to them, laughing. Some of them regarded him as a
 curious little creature, so serious, yet so bright and jolly, and always
 so delicate in his way with them. They all liked him, and he adored them.
 Polly he felt he belonged to. Then Connie, with her mane of red hair, her
 face of apple-blossom, her murmuring voice, such a lady in her shabby
 black frock, appealed to his romantic side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When you sit winding," he said, "it looks as if you were spinning at a
 spinning-wheel?it looks ever so nice. You remind me of Elaine in the
 'Idylls of the King'. I'd draw you if I could."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she glanced at him blushing shyly. And later on he had a sketch he
 prized very much: Connie sitting on the stool before the wheel, her
 flowing mane of red hair on her rusty black frock, her red mouth shut and
 serious, running the scarlet thread off the hank on to the reel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With Louie, handsome and brazen, who always seemed to thrust her hip at
 him, he usually joked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma was rather plain, rather old, and condescending. But to condescend to
 him made her happy, and he did not mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you put needles in?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go away and don't bother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I ought to know how to put needles in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She ground at her machine all the while steadily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There are many things you ought to know," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me, then, how to stick needles in the machine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, the boy, what a nuisance he is! Why, THIS is how you do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He watched her attentively. Suddenly a whistle piped. Then Polly appeared,
 and said in a clear voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Pappleworth wants to know how much longer you're going to be down
 here playing with the girls, Paul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul flew upstairs, calling "Good-bye!" and Emma drew herself up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It wasn't ME who wanted him to play with the machine," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As a rule, when all the girls came back at two o'clock, he ran upstairs to
 Fanny, the hunchback, in the finishing-off room. Mr. Pappleworth did not
 appear till twenty to three, and he often found his boy sitting beside
 Fanny, talking, or drawing, or singing with the girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Often, after a minute's hesitation, Fanny would begin to sing. She had a
 fine contralto voice. Everybody joined in the chorus, and it went well.
 Paul was not at all embarrassed, after a while, sitting in the room with
 the half a dozen work-girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the end of the song Fanny would say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know you've been laughing at me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be so soft, Fanny!" cried one of the girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once there was mention of Connie's red hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fanny's is better, to my fancy," said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You needn't try to make a fool of me," said Fanny, flushing deeply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, but she has, Paul; she's got beautiful hair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a treat of a colour," said he. "That coldish colour like earth, and
 yet shiny. It's like bog-water."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness me!" exclaimed one girl, laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How I do but get criticised," said Fanny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you should see it down, Paul," cried Emma earnestly. "It's simply
 beautiful. Put it down for him, Fanny, if he wants something to paint."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fanny would not, and yet she wanted to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I'll take it down myself," said the lad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you can if you like," said Fanny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he carefully took the pins out of the knot, and the rush of hair, of
 uniform dark brown, slid over the humped back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a lovely lot!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girls watched. There was silence. The youth shook the hair loose from
 the coil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's splendid!" he said, smelling its perfume. "I'll bet it's worth
 pounds."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll leave it you when I die, Paul," said Fanny, half joking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You look just like anybody else, sitting drying their hair," said one of
 the girls to the long-legged hunchback.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poor Fanny was morbidly sensitive, always imagining insults. Polly was
 curt and businesslike. The two departments were for ever at war, and Paul
 was always finding Fanny in tears. Then he was made the recipient of all
 her woes, and he had to plead her case with Polly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the time went along happily enough. The factory had a homely feel. No
 one was rushed or driven. Paul always enjoyed it when the work got faster,
 towards post-time, and all the men united in labour. He liked to watch his
 fellow-clerks at work. The man was the work and the work was the man, one
 thing, for the time being. It was different with the girls. The real woman
 never seemed to be there at the task, but as if left out, waiting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the train going home at night he used to watch the lights of the
 town, sprinkled thick on the hills, fusing together in a blaze in the
 valleys. He felt rich in life and happy. Drawing farther off, there was a
 patch of lights at Bulwell like myriad petals shaken to the ground from
 the shed stars; and beyond was the red glare of the furnaces, playing like
 hot breath on the clouds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had to walk two and more miles from Keston home, up two long hills,
 down two short hills. He was often tired, and he counted the lamps
 climbing the hill above him, how many more to pass. And from the hilltop,
 on pitch-dark nights, he looked round on the villages five or six miles
 away, that shone like swarms of glittering living things, almost a heaven
 against his feet. Marlpool and Heanor scattered the far-off darkness with
 brilliance. And occasionally the black valley space between was traced,
 violated by a great train rushing south to London or north to Scotland.
 The trains roared by like projectiles level on the darkness, fuming and
 burning, making the valley clang with their passage. They were gone, and
 the lights of the towns and villages glittered in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then he came to the corner at home, which faced the other side of the
 night. The ash-tree seemed a friend now. His mother rose with gladness as
 he entered. He put his eight shillings proudly on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'll help, mother?" he asked wistfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's precious little left," she answered, "after your ticket and
 dinners and such are taken off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he told her the budget of the day. His life-story, like an Arabian
 Nights, was told night after night to his mother. It was almost as if it
 were her own life.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI
 </h2>
 <h3>
 DEATH IN THE FAMILY
 </h3>
 <p>
 ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy, a
 good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he had to
 work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In appearance he remained the flower of the family, being well made,
 graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and
 his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his
 generous manner and fiery temper, made him a favourite. But as he grew
 older his temper became uncertain. He flew into rages over nothing, seemed
 unbearably raw and irritable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes. He thought only of
 himself. When he wanted amusement, all that stood in his way he hated,
 even if it were she. When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who, he said,
 hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you can't alter it, put
 up with it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him, he came to
 detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His body, which had
 been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to ripen
 with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came over him
 a look of meanness and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly
 man bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover,
 Morel's manners got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When
 the children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence, the
 father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners in the
 house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going straight out of
 the house when his father disgusted him. And Morel persisted the more
 because his children hated it. He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in
 disgusting them, and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably
 sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was
 growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst of
 all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred of
 his children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout. "He does
 his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog. But I'm not going to
 stand it, I tell you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as he
 imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle now went on
 nearly all between father and children, he persisting in his dirty and
 disgusting ways, just to assert his independence. They loathed him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he won a
 scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother decided to
 let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only come home at
 week-ends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning about four
 shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings, since she had
 passed her examination, and there would be financial peace in the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant. But still he
 stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother. Everything he did
 was for her. She waited for his coming home in the evening, and then she
 unburdened herself of all she had pondered, or of all that had occurred to
 her during the day. He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two
 shared lives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her an engagement
 ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped at such a fabulous
 price.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me some on't, it
 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU some of it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all, and she preferred
 William, who was not mean, if he were foolish. But now the young man
 talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed, and the
 different resplendent clothes she wore; or he told his mother with glee
 how they went to the theatre like great swells.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she should come at the
 Christmas. This time William arrived with a lady, but with no presents.
 Mrs. Morel had prepared supper. Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to
 the door. William entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside to present a
 tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine black-and-white
 check, and furs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's Gyp!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How should I?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced round the
 kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its glittering
 kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and
 little deal table. At that moment Morel came in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, dad!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two shook hands, and William presented the lady. She gave the same
 smile that showed her teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you do, Mr. Morel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel bowed obsequiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself very
 welcome."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up this box."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William to his
 betrothed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak, preceded the
 young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel had vacated for
 her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight. The colliers' wives only
 lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, thank you very much!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think she's rather tired, mother," said William. "It's a beastly
 journey, and we had such a rush."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no, she'll be all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour Miss Western
 came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress, very fine for the
 collier's kitchen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile to Mrs. Morel.
 "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't, really!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel jumped out of his armchair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here, Miss
 Wesson."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself in the collier's
 armchair, the place of honour. She shivered, feeling the warmth of the
 kitchen penetrate her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth to him,
 and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone; which made the
 rest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present. The young lady
 evidently did not realise them as people: they were creatures to her for
 the present. William winced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been a lady
 condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her, certainly
 clownish?in short, the working classes. How was she to adjust
 herself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll go," said Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken. But when the girl
 came downstairs again with the handkerchief, she said: "Oh, thank you!" in
 a gracious way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been so poor;
 about London, about dances. She was really very nervous, and chattered
 from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco,
 watching her, and listening to her glib London speech, as he puffed. Mrs.
 Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse, answered quietly and
 rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and admiration.
 Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was got out for her:
 the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug.
 The children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange, not
 able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked,
 and was slightly uncomfortable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At about ten o'clock he said to her:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you tired, Gyp?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones and putting
 her head slightly on one side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," replied the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap into a stone
 beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pit-singlet, and
 kissed her mother good-night. She was to share the room with the lady,
 because the house was full.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat nursing the
 hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round, to everybody's
 discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William. In five minutes
 he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore; he did not know why.
 He talked very little till everybody had gone to bed, but himself and his
 mother. Then he stood with his legs apart, in his old attitude on the
 hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, my son?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated, for his
 sake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you like her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," came the slow answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different from her
 aunt's house, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't put on her
 BLESSED airs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow was gloomy. "You
 know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious, and she can't think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's young, my boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was a child.
 Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear. And her father
 was a rake. She's had no love."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! Well, you must make up to her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so?you have to forgive her a lot of things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's never had
 anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY fond of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anybody can see that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you know, mother?she's?she's different from us. Those
 sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem to have the
 same principles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he seemed uneasy within himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," her voice called faintly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom. She did not come
 down in half an hour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked of Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, she was," replied Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Happy New Year," he called.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buck up!" he implored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her. Morel, who always
 rose before six, looked at the clock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went to the foot of the
 stairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called, rather
 crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that time of
 preparation, something like magic. At last she came, looking very nice in
 a blouse and skirt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it, Mrs. Morel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William to chapel,
 he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs and London-made
 costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected everybody to bow to the ground
 in admiration. And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the
 road, watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes and
 princesses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been a sort of
 secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she was with the Morels
 she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul wait on her as if they were
 her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel with a certain glibness and Morel
 with patronage. But after a day or so she began to change her tune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them on their walks.
 It was so much more interesting. And Paul really DID admire "Gipsy"
 wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely forgave the boy for the
 adulation with which he treated the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know where I left my
 muff?" William replied:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it angered the young
 man that she made a servant of his sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together in the parlour
 by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven Mrs. Morel was heard
 raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen, followed by his beloved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been sitting alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't you trust us, mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven if you
 like, and I can read."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep mater waiting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel; "I think you
 will see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs, and she went. He
 returned to the kitchen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young things like you
 alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother good-night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his sweetheart
 endlessly with his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her a bit. I
 shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then, when I'm with her in
 the evenings I am awfully fond of her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel, "if she holds
 you no more than that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him. "But yet?there's
 so much between us now I couldn't give her up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I wouldn't
 call it LOVE?at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled and rather
 fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength and money went in
 keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford to take his mother to
 Nottingham when he came over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings, to his great
 joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health suffered from the long
 hours and the confinement. His mother, to whom he became more and more
 significant, thought how to help.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday morning in May,
 as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think it will be a fine day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked up in surprise. This meant something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm. Well, he asked me
 last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers, and I promised to bring
 you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go this
 afternoon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road was a
 cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the Statutes ground
 burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green. And the steep swoop of
 highroad lay, in its cool morning dust, splendid with patterns of sunshine
 and shadow, perfectly still. The trees sloped their great green shoulders
 proudly; and inside the warehouse all the morning, the boy had a vision of
 spring outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are we going?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When I'm ready," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently he got up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took her boots.
 They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally exquisite
 people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes. But Paul had to
 clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight shillings a pair. He,
 however, thought them the most dainty boots in the world, and he cleaned
 them with as much reverence as if they had been flowers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly. She had got a new
 cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high and mighty, "do
 you like it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went and surveyed her from the back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you, I should
 say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it suits her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was wrapped in
 burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending to know better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings. You couldn't have
 got it ready-made for that price, could you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think you couldn't," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And, you know, it's good stuff."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Awfully pretty," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you buy some
 false white hair and stick it on your head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white fast enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want with a
 white-haired mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said rather
 strangely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William had given
 her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller than she, though he
 was not big. He fancied himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit waved its
 plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on the road to
 watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled a little group in
 silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck, and a man. They
 climbed the incline against the heavens. At the end the man tipped the
 wagon. There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope of
 the enormous bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on a bank, whilst
 he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked, looking round at the
 afternoon, the red cottages shining among their greenness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully beautiful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together, like something
 alive almost?a big creature that you don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts to be fed,"
 he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And very thankful I am they ARE standing," she said, "for that means
 they'll turn middling time this week."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I like the feel of MEN on things, while they're alive. There's a feel
 of men about trucks, because they've been handled with men's hands, all of
 them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went along under the trees of the highroad. He was constantly
 informing her, but she was interested. They passed the end of Nethermere,
 that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in its lap. Then they
 turned on a private road, and in some trepidation approached a big farm. A
 dog barked furiously. A woman came out to see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is this the way to Willey Farm?" Mrs. Morel asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul hung behind in terror of being sent back. But the woman was amiable,
 and directed them. The mother and son went through the wheat and oats,
 over a little bridge into a wild meadow. Peewits, with their white breasts
 glistening, wheeled and screamed about them. The lake was still and blue.
 High overhead a heron floated. Opposite, the wood heaped on the hill,
 green and still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a wild road, mother," said Paul. "Just like Canada."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it beautiful!" said Mrs. Morel, looking round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See that heron?see?see her legs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He directed his mother, what she must see and what not. And she was quite
 content.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But now," she said, "which way? He told me through the wood."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The wood, fenced and dark, lay on their left.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can feel a bit of a path this road," said Paul. "You've got town feet,
 somehow or other, you have."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found a little gate, and soon were in a broad green alley of the
 wood, with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand, an old oak glade
 dipping down on the other. And among the oaks the bluebells stood in pools
 of azure, under the new green hazels, upon a pale fawn floor of
 oak-leaves. He found flowers for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's a bit of new-mown hay," he said; then, again, he brought her
 forget-me-nots. And, again, his heart hurt with love, seeing her hand,
 used with work, holding the little bunch of flowers he gave her. She was
 perfectly happy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But at the end of the riding was a fence to climb. Paul was over in a
 second.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," he said, "let me help you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, go away. I will do it in my own way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood below with his hands up ready to help her. She climbed
 cautiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a way to climb!" he exclaimed scornfully, when she was safely to
 earth again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hateful stiles!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Duffer of a little woman," he replied, "who can't get over 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In front, along the edge of the wood, was a cluster of low red farm
 buildings. The two hastened forward. Flush with the wood was the apple
 orchard, where blossom was falling on the grindstone. The pond was deep
 under a hedge and overhanging oak trees. Some cows stood in the shade. The
 farm and buildings, three sides of a quadrangle, embraced the sunshine
 towards the wood. It was very still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mother and son went into the small railed garden, where was a scent of red
 gillivers. By the open door were some floury loaves, put out to cool. A
 hen was just coming to peck them. Then, in the doorway suddenly appeared a
 girl in a dirty apron. She was about fourteen years old, had a rosy dark
 face, a bunch of short black curls, very fine and free, and dark eyes;
 shy, questioning, a little resentful of the strangers, she disappeared. In
 a minute another figure appeared, a small, frail woman, rosy, with great
 dark brown eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" she exclaimed, smiling with a little glow, "you've come, then. I AM
 glad to see you." Her voice was intimate and rather sad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two women shook hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now are you sure we're not a bother to you?" said Mrs. Morel. "I know
 what a farming life is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no! We're only too thankful to see a new face, it's so lost up here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose so," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were taken through into the parlour?a long, low room, with a
 great bunch of guelder-roses in the fireplace. There the women talked,
 whilst Paul went out to survey the land. He was in the garden smelling the
 gillivers and looking at the plants, when the girl came out quickly to the
 heap of coal which stood by the fence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose these are cabbage-roses?" he said to her, pointing to the
 bushes along the fence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him with startled, big brown eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose they are cabbage-roses when they come out?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," she faltered. "They're white with pink middles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then they're maiden-blush."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam flushed. She had a beautiful warm colouring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't have MUCH in your garden," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is our first year here," she answered, in a distant, rather superior
 way, drawing back and going indoors. He did not notice, but went his round
 of exploration. Presently his mother came out, and they went through the
 buildings. Paul was hugely delighted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after?" said
 Mrs. Morel to Mrs. Leivers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," replied the little woman. "I can't find time to look after cattle,
 and I'm not used to it. It's as much as I can do to keep going in the
 house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I suppose it is," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently the girl came out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tea is ready, mother," she said in a musical, quiet voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, thank you, Miriam, then we'll come," replied her mother, almost
 ingratiatingly. "Would you CARE to have tea now, Mrs. Morel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course," said Mrs. Morel. "Whenever it's ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul and his mother and Mrs. Leivers had tea together. Then they went out
 into the wood that was flooded with bluebells, while fumy forget-me-nots
 were in the paths. The mother and son were in ecstasy together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they got back to the house, Mr. Leivers and Edgar, the eldest son,
 were in the kitchen. Edgar was about eighteen. Then Geoffrey and Maurice,
 big lads of twelve and thirteen, were in from school. Mr. Leivers was a
 good-looking man in the prime of life, with a golden-brown moustache, and
 blue eyes screwed up against the weather.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys were condescending, but Paul scarcely observed it. They went
 round for eggs, scrambling into all sorts of places. As they were feeding
 the fowls Miriam came out. The boys took no notice of her. One hen, with
 her yellow chickens, was in a coop. Maurice took his hand full of corn and
 let the hen peck from it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Durst you do it?" he asked of Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's see," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had a small hand, warm, and rather capable-looking. Miriam watched. He
 held the corn to the hen. The bird eyed it with her hard, bright eye, and
 suddenly made a peck into his hand. He started, and laughed. "Rap, rap,
 rap!" went the bird's beak in his palm. He laughed again, and the other
 boys joined.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She knocks you, and nips you, but she never hurts," said Paul, when the
 last corn had gone. "Now, Miriam," said Maurice, "you come an 'ave a go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she cried, shrinking back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha! baby. The mardy-kid!" said her brothers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It doesn't hurt a bit," said Paul. "It only just nips rather nicely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she still cried, shaking her black curls and shrinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She dursn't," said Geoffrey. "She niver durst do anything except recite
 poitry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dursn't jump off a gate, dursn't tweedle, dursn't go on a slide, dursn't
 stop a girl hittin' her. She can do nowt but go about thinkin' herself
 somebody. 'The Lady of the Lake.' Yah!" cried Maurice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was crimson with shame and misery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I dare do more than you," she cried. "You're never anything but cowards
 and bullies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, cowards and bullies!" they repeated mincingly, mocking her speech.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Not such a clown shall anger me,
 A boor is answered silently,"
</pre>
 <p>
 he quoted against her, shouting with laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went indoors. Paul went with the boys into the orchard, where they had
 rigged up a parallel bar. They did feats of strength. He was more agile
 than strong, but it served. He fingered a piece of apple-blossom that hung
 low on a swinging bough.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wouldn't get the apple-blossom," said Edgar, the eldest brother.
 "There'll be no apples next year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wasn't going to get it," replied Paul, going away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys felt hostile to him; they were more interested in their own
 pursuits. He wandered back to the house to look for his mother. As he went
 round the back, he saw Miriam kneeling in front of the hen-coop, some
 maize in her hand, biting her lip, and crouching in an intense attitude.
 The hen was eyeing her wickedly. Very gingerly she put forward her hand.
 The hen bobbed for her. She drew back quickly with a cry, half of fear,
 half of chagrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It won't hurt you," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She flushed crimson and started up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I only wanted to try," she said in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See, it doesn't hurt," he said, and, putting only two corns in his palm,
 he let the hen peck, peck, peck at his bare hand. "It only makes you
 laugh," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She put her hand forward and dragged it away, tried again, and started
 back with a cry. He frowned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, I'd let her take corn from my face," said Paul, "only she bumps a
 bit. She's ever so neat. If she wasn't, look how much ground she'd peck up
 every day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He waited grimly, and watched. At last Miriam let the bird peck from her
 hand. She gave a little cry?fear, and pain because of fear?rather
 pathetic. But she had done it, and she did it again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, you see," said the boy. "It doesn't hurt, does it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him with dilated dark eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she laughed, trembling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she rose and went indoors. She seemed to be in some way resentful of
 the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He thinks I'm only a common girl," she thought, and she wanted to prove
 she was a grand person like the "Lady of the Lake".
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul found his mother ready to go home. She smiled on her son. He took the
 great bunch of flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Leivers walked down the fields with
 them. The hills were golden with evening; deep in the woods showed the
 darkening purple of bluebells. It was everywhere perfectly stiff, save for
 the rustling of leaves and birds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it is a beautiful place," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," answered Mr. Leivers; "it's a nice little place, if only it weren't
 for the rabbits. The pasture's bitten down to nothing. I dunno if ever I
 s'll get the rent off it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He clapped his hands, and the field broke into motion near the woods,
 brown rabbits hopping everywhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you believe it!" exclaimed Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She and Paul went on alone together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wasn't it lovely, mother?" he said quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A thin moon was coming out. His heart was full of happiness till it hurt.
 His mother had to chatter, because she, too, wanted to cry with happiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now WOULDN'T I help that man!" she said. "WOULDN'T I see to the fowls and
 the young stock! And I'D learn to milk, and I'D talk with him, and I'D
 plan with him. My word, if I were his wife, the farm would be run, I know!
 But there, she hasn't the strength?she simply hasn't the strength.
 She ought never to have been burdened like it, you know. I'm sorry for
 her, and I'm sorry for him too. My word, if I'D had him, I shouldn't have
 thought him a bad husband! Not that she does either; and she's very
 lovable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William came home again with his sweetheart at the Whitsuntide. He had one
 week of his holidays then. It was beautiful weather. As a rule, William
 and Lily and Paul went out in the morning together for a walk. William did
 not talk to his beloved much, except to tell her things from his boyhood.
 Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all three, in a
 meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm, was a beautiful
 quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping from the hedges; penny
 daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like laughter. William, a big
 fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a bit gaunt, lay back in the
 sunshine and dreamed, while she fingered with his hair. Paul went
 gathering the big daisies. She had taken off her hat; her hair was black
 as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded daisies in her jet-black
 hair?big spangles of white and yellow, and just a pink touch of
 ragged robin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you look like a young witch-woman," the boy said to her. "Doesn't
 she, William?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lily laughed. William opened his eyes and looked at her. In his gaze was a
 certain baffled look of misery and fierce appreciation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has he made a sight of me?" she asked, laughing down on her lover.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That he has!" said William, smiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at her. Her beauty seemed to hurt him. He glanced at her
 flower-decked head and frowned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You look nice enough, if that's what you want to know," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she walked without her hat. In a little while William recovered, and
 was rather tender to her. Coming to a bridge, he carved her initials and
 his in a heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 L. L. W. W. M.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She watched his strong, nervous hand, with its glistening hairs and
 freckles, as he carved, and she seemed fascinated by it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth, and a certain
 tenderness in the house, whilst William and Lily were at home. But often
 he got irritable. She had brought, for an eight-days' stay, five dresses
 and six blouses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, would you mind," she said to Annie, "washing me these two blouses,
 and these things?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Annie stood washing when William and Lily went out the next morning.
 Mrs. Morel was furious. And sometimes the young man, catching a glimpse of
 his sweetheart's attitude towards his sister, hated her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Sunday morning she looked very beautiful in a dress of foulard, silky
 and sweeping, and blue as a jay-bird's feather, and in a large cream hat
 covered with many roses, mostly crimson. Nobody could admire her enough.
 But in the evening, when she was going out, she asked again:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chubby, have you got my gloves?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which?" asked William.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My new black SUEDE."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a hunt. She had lost them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, mother," said William, "that's the fourth pair she's lost
 since Christmas?at five shillings a pair!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You only gave me TWO of them," she remonstrated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in the evening, after supper, he stood on the hearthrug whilst she sat
 on the sofa, and he seemed to hate her. In the afternoon he had left her
 whilst he went to see some old friend. She had sat looking at a book.
 After supper William wanted to write a letter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is your book, Lily," said Mrs. Morel. "Would you care to go on with
 it for a few minutes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thank you," said the girl. "I will sit still."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it is so dull."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William scribbled irritably at a great rate. As he sealed the envelope he
 said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Read a book! Why, she's never read a book in her life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, go along!" said Mrs. Morel, cross with the exaggeration,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's true, mother?she hasn't," he cried, jumping up and taking his
 old position on the hearthrug. "She's never read a book in her life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Er's like me," chimed in Morel. "'Er canna see what there is i' books,
 ter sit borin' your nose in 'em for, nor more can I."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you shouldn't say these things," said Mrs. Morel to her son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's true, mother?she CAN'T read. What did you give her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I gave her a little thing of Annie Swan's. Nobody wants to read dry
 stuff on Sunday afternoon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll bet she didn't read ten lines of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are mistaken," said his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the time Lily sat miserably on the sofa. He turned to her swiftly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "DID you read any?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I did," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know how many pages."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me ONE THING you read."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She could not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She never got beyond the second page. He read a great deal, and had a
 quick, active intelligence. She could understand nothing but love-making
 and chatter. He was accustomed to having all his thoughts sifted through
 his mother's mind; so, when he wanted companionship, and was asked in
 reply to be the billing and twittering lover, he hated his betrothed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, mother," he said, when he was alone with her at night, "she's
 no idea of money, she's so wessel-brained. When she's paid, she'll
 suddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces, and then I have to buy her season
 ticket, and her extras, even her underclothing. And she wants to get
 married, and I think myself we might as well get married next year. But at
 this rate?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A fine mess of a marriage it would be," replied his mother. "I should
 consider it again, my boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well, I've gone too far to break off now," he said, "and so I shall
 get married as soon as I can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, my boy. If you will, you will, and there's no stopping you;
 but I tell you, I can't sleep when I think about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, she'll be all right, mother. We shall manage."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she lets you buy her underclothing?" asked the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he began apologetically, "she didn't ask me; but one morning?and
 it WAS cold?I found her on the station shivering, not able to keep
 still; so I asked her if she was well wrapped up. She said: 'I think so.'
 So I said: 'Have you got warm underthings on?' And she said: 'No, they
 were cotton.' I asked her why on earth she hadn't got something thicker on
 in weather like that, and she said because she HAD nothing. And there she
 is?a bronchial subject! I HAD to take her and get some warm things.
 Well, mother, I shouldn't mind the money if we had any. And, you know, she
 OUGHT to keep enough to pay for her season-ticket; but no, she comes to me
 about that, and I have to find the money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a poor lookout," said Mrs. Morel bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was pale, and his rugged face, that used to be so perfectly careless
 and laughing, was stamped with conflict and despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I can't give her up now; it's gone too far," he said. "And, besides,
 for SOME things I couldn't do without her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My boy, remember you're taking your life in your hands," said Mrs. Morel.
 "NOTHING is as bad as a marriage that's a hopeless failure. Mine was bad
 enough, God knows, and ought to teach you something; but it might have
 been worse by a long chalk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He leaned with his back against the side of the chimney-piece, his hands
 in his pockets. He was a big, raw-boned man, who looked as if he would go
 to the world's end if he wanted to. But she saw the despair on his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I couldn't give her up now," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she said, "remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an
 engagement."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't give her up NOW," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clock ticked on; mother and son remained in silence, a conflict
 between them; but he would say no more. At last she said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, go to bed, my son. You'll feel better in the morning, and perhaps
 you'll know better."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He kissed her, and went. She raked the fire. Her heart was heavy now as it
 had never been. Before, with her husband, things had seemed to be breaking
 down in her, but they did not destroy her power to live. Now her soul felt
 lamed in itself. It was her hope that was struck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so often William manifested the same hatred towards his betrothed. On
 the last evening at home he was railing against her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "if you don't believe me, what she's like, would you
 believe she has been confirmed three times?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nonsense!" laughed Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nonsense or not, she HAS! That's what confirmation means for her?a
 bit of a theatrical show where she can cut a figure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I haven't, Mrs. Morel!" cried the girl?"I haven't! it is not true!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" he cried, flashing round on her. "Once in Bromley, once in
 Beckenham, and once somewhere else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nowhere else!" she said, in tears?"nowhere else!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It WAS! And if it wasn't why were you confirmed TWICE?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Once I was only fourteen, Mrs. Morel," she pleaded, tears in her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Mrs. Morel; "I can quite understand it, child. Take no notice
 of him. You ought to be ashamed, William, saying such things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's true. She's religious?she had blue velvet Prayer-Books?and
 she's not as much religion, or anything else, in her than that table-leg.
 Gets confirmed three times for show, to show herself off, and that's how
 she is in EVERYTHING?EVERYTHING!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl sat on the sofa, crying. She was not strong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As for LOVE!" he cried, "you might as well ask a fly to love you! It'll
 love settling on you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, say no more," commanded Mrs. Morel. "If you want to say these
 things, you must find another place than this. I am ashamed of you,
 William! Why don't you be more manly. To do nothing but find fault with a
 girl, and then pretend you're engaged to her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel subsided in wrath and indignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William was silent, and later he repented, kissed and comforted the girl.
 Yet it was true, what he had said. He hated her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they were going away, Mrs. Morel accompanied them as far as
 Nottingham. It was a long way to Keston station.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, mother," he said to her, "Gyp's shallow. Nothing goes deep with
 her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "William, I WISH you wouldn't say these things," said Mrs. Morel, very
 uncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it doesn't, mother. She's very much in love with me now, but if I
 died she'd have forgotten me in three months."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel was afraid. Her heart beat furiously, hearing the quiet
 bitterness of her son's last speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you know?" she replied. "You DON'T know, and therefore you've no
 right to say such a thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's always saying these things!" cried the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In three months after I was buried you'd have somebody else, and I should
 be forgotten," he said. "And that's your love!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel saw them into the train in Nottingham, then she returned home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's one comfort," she said to Paul?"he'll never have any money
 to marry on, that I AM sure of. And so she'll save him that way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she took cheer. Matters were not yet very desperate. She firmly
 believed William would never marry his Gipsy. She waited, and she kept
 Paul near to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All summer long William's letters had a feverish tone; he seemed unnatural
 and intense. Sometimes he was exaggeratedly jolly, usually he was flat and
 bitter in his letter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah," his mother said, "I'm afraid he's ruining himself against that
 creature, who isn't worthy of his love?no, no more than a rag doll."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wanted to come home. The midsummer holiday was gone; it was a long
 while to Christmas. He wrote in wild excitement, saying he could come for
 Saturday and Sunday at Goose Fair, the first week in October.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are not well, my boy," said his mother, when she saw him. She was
 almost in tears at having him to herself again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I've not been well," he said. "I've seemed to have a dragging cold
 all the last month, but it's going, I think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was sunny October weather. He seemed wild with joy, like a schoolboy
 escaped; then again he was silent and reserved. He was more gaunt than
 ever, and there was a haggard look in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are doing too much," said his mother to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was doing extra work, trying to make some money to marry on, he said.
 He only talked to his mother once on the Saturday night; then he was sad
 and tender about his beloved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And yet, you know, mother, for all that, if I died she'd be
 broken-hearted for two months, and then she'd start to forget me. You'd
 see, she'd never come home here to look at my grave, not even once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, William," said his mother, "you're not going to die, so why talk
 about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But whether or not?" he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she can't help it. She is like that, and if you choose her?well,
 you can't grumble," said his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Sunday morning, as he was putting his collar on:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look," he said to his mother, holding up his chin, "what a rash my
 collar's made under my chin!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ought not to do that," said his mother. "Here, put a bit of this
 soothing ointment on. You should wear different collars."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went away on Sunday midnight, seeming better and more solid for his two
 days at home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Tuesday morning came a telegram from London that he was ill. Mrs. Morel
 got off her knees from washing the floor, read the telegram, called a
 neighbour, went to her landlady and borrowed a sovereign, put on her
 things, and set off. She hurried to Keston, caught an express for London
 in Nottingham. She had to wait in Nottingham nearly an hour. A small
 figure in her black bonnet, she was anxiously asking the porters if they
 knew how to get to Elmers End. The journey was three hours. She sat in her
 corner in a kind of stupor, never moving. At King's Cross still no one
 could tell her how to get to Elmers End. Carrying her string bag, that
 contained her nightdress, a comb and brush, she went from person to
 person. At last they sent her underground to Cannon Street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was six o'clock when she arrived at William's lodging. The blinds were
 not down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is he?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No better," said the landlady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She followed the woman upstairs. William lay on the bed, with bloodshot
 eyes, his face rather discoloured. The clothes were tossed about, there
 was no fire in the room, a glass of milk stood on the stand at his
 bedside. No one had been with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, my son!" said the mother bravely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not answer. He looked at her, but did not see her. Then he began to
 say, in a dull voice, as if repeating a letter from dictation: "Owing to a
 leakage in the hold of this vessel, the sugar had set, and become
 converted into rock. It needed hacking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was quite unconscious. It had been his business to examine some such
 cargo of sugar in the Port of London.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long has he been like this?" the mother asked the landlady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He got home at six o'clock on Monday morning, and he seemed to sleep all
 day; then in the night we heard him talking, and this morning he asked for
 you. So I wired, and we fetched the doctor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you have a fire made?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel tried to soothe her son, to keep him still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doctor came. It was pneumonia, and, he said, a peculiar erysipelas,
 which had started under the chin where the collar chafed, and was
 spreading over the face. He hoped it would not get to the brain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel settled down to nurse. She prayed for William, prayed that he
 would recognise her. But the young man's face grew more discoloured. In
 the night she struggled with him. He raved, and raved, and would not come
 to consciousness. At two o'clock, in a dreadful paroxysm, he died.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging bedroom; then
 she roused the household.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At six o'clock, with the aid of the charwoman, she laid him out; then she
 went round the dreary London village to the registrar and the doctor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At nine o'clock to the cottage on Scargill Street came another wire:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "William died last night. Let father come, bring money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie, Paul, and Arthur were at home; Mr. Morel was gone to work. The
 three children said not a word. Annie began to whimper with fear; Paul set
 off for his father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a beautiful day. At Brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in
 the sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of the headstocks twinkled
 high up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the trucks, made a busy
 noise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want my father; he's got to go to London," said the boy to the first
 man he met on the bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha wants Walter Morel? Go in theer an' tell Joe Ward."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul went into the little top office.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want my father; he's got to go to London."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thy feyther? Is he down? What's his name?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Morel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, Walter? Is owt amiss?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's got to go to London."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Walter Morel's wanted, number 42, Hard. Summat's amiss; there's his lad
 here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he turned round to Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He'll be up in a few minutes," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul wandered out to the pit-top. He watched the chair come up, with its
 wagon of coal. The great iron cage sank back on its rest, a full carfle
 was hauled off, an empty tram run on to the chair, a bell ting'ed
 somewhere, the chair heaved, then dropped like a stone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul did not realise William was dead; it was impossible, with such a
 bustle going on. The puller-off swung the small truck on to the
 turn-table, another man ran with it along the bank down the curving lines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And William is dead, and my mother's in London, and what will she be
 doing?" the boy asked himself, as if it were a conundrum.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He watched chair after chair come up, and still no father. At last,
 standing beside a wagon, a man's form! the chair sank on its rests, Morel
 stepped off. He was slightly lame from an accident.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it thee, Paul? Is 'e worse?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've got to go to London."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two walked off the pit-bank, where men were watching curiously. As
 they came out and went along the railway, with the sunny autumn field on
 one side and a wall of trucks on the other, Morel said in a frightened
 voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'E's niver gone, child?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When wor't?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Last night. We had a telegram from my mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel walked on a few strides, then leaned up against a truck-side, his
 hand over his eyes. He was not crying. Paul stood looking round, waiting.
 On the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly. Paul saw everything,
 except his father leaning against the truck as if he were tired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel had only once before been to London. He set off, scared and peaked,
 to help his wife. That was on Tuesday. The children were left alone in the
 house. Paul went to work, Arthur went to school, and Annie had in a friend
 to be with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Saturday night, as Paul was turning the corner, coming home from
 Keston, he saw his mother and father, who had come to Sethley Bridge
 Station. They were walking in silence in the dark, tired, straggling
 apart. The boy waited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother!" he said, in the darkness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel's small figure seemed not to observe. He spoke again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul!" she said, uninterestedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She let him kiss her, but she seemed unaware of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the house she was the same?small, white, and mute. She noticed
 nothing, she said nothing, only:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The coffin will be here to-night, Walter. You'd better see about some
 help." Then, turning to the children: "We're bringing him home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she relapsed into the same mute looking into space, her hands folded
 on her lap. Paul, looking at her, felt he could not breathe. The house was
 dead silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I went to work, mother," he said plaintively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you?" she answered, dully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After half an hour Morel, troubled and bewildered, came in again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wheer s'll we ha'e him when he DOES come?" he asked his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the front-room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I'd better shift th' table?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' ha'e him across th' chairs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know there?Yes, I suppose so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel and Paul went, with a candle, into the parlour. There was no gas
 there. The father unscrewed the top of the big mahogany oval table, and
 cleared the middle of the room; then he arranged six chairs opposite each
 other, so that the coffin could stand on their beds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You niver seed such a length as he is!" said the miner, and watching
 anxiously as he worked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul went to the bay window and looked out. The ash-tree stood monstrous
 and black in front of the wide darkness. It was a faintly luminous night.
 Paul went back to his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At ten o'clock Morel called:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everyone started. There was a noise of unbarring and unlocking the front
 door, which opened straight from the night into the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bring another candle," called Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie and Arthur went. Paul followed with his mother. He stood with his
 arm round her waist in the inner doorway. Down the middle of the cleared
 room waited six chairs, face to face. In the window, against the lace
 curtains, Arthur held up one candle, and by the open door, against the
 night, Annie stood leaning forward, her brass candlestick glittering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was the noise of wheels. Outside in the darkness of the street below
 Paul could see horses and a black vehicle, one lamp, and a few pale faces;
 then some men, miners, all in their shirt-sleeves, seemed to struggle in
 the obscurity. Presently two men appeared, bowed beneath a great weight.
 It was Morel and his neighbour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Steady!" called Morel, out of breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He and his fellow mounted the steep garden step, heaved into the
 candlelight with their gleaming coffin-end. Limbs of other men were seen
 struggling behind. Morel and Burns, in front, staggered; the great dark
 weight swayed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Steady, steady!" cried Morel, as if in pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the six bearers were up in the small garden, holding the great coffin
 aloft. There were three more steps to the door. The yellow lamp of the
 carriage shone alone down the black road.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now then!" said Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The coffin swayed, the men began to mount the three steps with their load.
 Annie's candle flickered, and she whimpered as the first men appeared, and
 the limbs and bowed heads of six men struggled to climb into the room,
 bearing the coffin that rode like sorrow on their living flesh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my son?my son!" Mrs. Morel sang softly, and each time the
 coffin swung to the unequal climbing of the men: "Oh, my son?my son?my
 son!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother!" Paul whimpered, his hand round her waist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not hear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my son?my son!" she repeated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul saw drops of sweat fall from his father's brow. Six men were in the
 room?six coatless men, with yielding, struggling limbs, filling the
 room and knocking against the furniture. The coffin veered, and was gently
 lowered on to the chairs. The sweat fell from Morel's face on its boards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed, bowed,
 and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again, closing the
 door behind them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box. William,
 when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument lay the
 bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never be got out of
 the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the hillside that
 looks over the fields at the big church and the houses. It was sunny, and
 the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves in the warmth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and take her old
 bright interest in life. She remained shut off. All the way home in the
 train she had said to herself: "If only it could have been me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting, her day's work
 done, with hands folded in her lap upon her coarse apron. She always used
 to have changed her dress and put on a black apron, before. Now Annie set
 his supper, and his mother sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth
 shut tight. Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch of a colliery
 at work was beautiful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced himself to tell
 her things, although she did not listen. It drove him almost insane to
 have her thus. At last:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not hear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lad?he was sixteen years old?went to bed drearily. He was
 cut off and wretched through October, November and December. His mother
 tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only brood on her dead
 son; he had been let to die so cruelly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box in his
 pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him, and her
 heart stood still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five shillings for a
 Christmas-box!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the old question.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I feel badly, mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously, the
 doctor said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let him go to
 Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him; they could
 not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached. One night he
 tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling of dissolution,
 when all the cells in the body seem in intense irritability to be breaking
 down, and consciousness makes a last flare of struggle, like madness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I s'll die, mother!" he cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my son?my son!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose up and arrested
 him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease of her for love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul was ill that
 Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile. His father
 had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips. They used to flame in the
 window in the March sunshine as he sat on the sofa chattering to his
 mother. The two knitted together in perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life
 now rooted itself in Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present and a letter
 from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had a letter at the New Year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there, and I
 enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every dance?did
 not sit out one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time after the
 death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze, staring wide-eyed and
 blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly and hurried out to the
 Three Spots, returning in his normal state. But never in his life would he
 go for a walk up Shepstone, past the office where his son had worked, and
 he always avoided the cemetery.

 CHAPTER VII
 </h2>
 <h3>
 LAD-AND-GIRL LOVE
 </h3>
 <p>
 PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn. He was
 friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not condescend
 at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached. She was afraid of
 being set at nought, as by her own brothers. The girl was romantic in her
 soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott heroine being loved by men with
 helmets or with plumes in their caps. She herself was something of a
 princess turned into a swine-girl in her own imagination. And she was
 afraid lest this boy, who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter
 Scott hero, who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
 and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her simply
 as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath; so she held
 aloof.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed, and
 inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion inside them,
 breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life in a mist thereof.
 So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure, which she loved
 tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset burned out the
 western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de Bois Guilberts,
 Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves in the morning, or
 sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed. That was life to her. For
 the rest, she drudged in the house, which work she would not have minded
 had not her clean red floor been mucked up immediately by the trampling
 farm-boots of her brothers. She madly wanted her little brother of four to
 let her swathe him and stifle him in her love; she went to church
 reverently, with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of
 the other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
 she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts; and she
 held not her father in too high esteem because he did not carry any
 mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted to have as easy a
 time as he could, and his meals when he was ready for them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered. She
 wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said he could
 read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the world would
 have a different face for her and a deepened respect. She could not be
 princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad to have learning whereon to
 pride herself. For she was different from other folk, and must not be
 scooped up among the common fry. Learning was the only distinction to
 which she thought to aspire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her beauty?that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive thing?seemed
 nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody, was not enough. She
 must have something to reinforce her pride, because she felt different
 from other people. Paul she eyed rather wistfully. On the whole, she
 scorned the male sex. But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful,
 who could be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
 a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor morsel of
 learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem. Yet she tried hard to
 scorn him, because he would not see in her the princess but only the
 swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she would be
 stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could be mistress of him
 in his weakness, take care of him, if he could depend on her, if she
 could, as it were, have him in her arms, how she would love him!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out, Paul drove off
 in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm. Mr. Leivers shouted in a
 kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked to the horse as they climbed the
 hill slowly, in the freshness of the morning. White clouds went on their
 way, crowding to the back of the hills that were rousing in the
 springtime. The water of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the
 seared meadows and the thorn-trees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges, vivid as
 copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called, and
 blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk through the
 big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the oak-wood, still
 bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down. He put up his hands
 for the whip and the rug that the good-looking, ruddy farmer handed down
 to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen, very beautiful,
 with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes dilating suddenly like an
 ecstasy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils are nearly out.
 Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The green on their buds?" and he faltered into silence timidly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded it to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take your coat. It IS
 heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused to such attention.
 She was almost smothered under its weight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
 swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you can
 manage there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been originally a
 labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered. But Paul loved
 it?loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug, and the funny
 little corner under the stairs, and the small window deep in the corner,
 through which, bending a little, he could see the plum trees in the back
 garden and the lovely round hills beyond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out, don't you
 think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines. I'm glad it's
 sunny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thank you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's your mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do. Perhaps in a
 little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll be able to rest. I
 s'll be glad if she can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't ill herself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched everything that
 happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes were quick and bright
 with life as ever. He watched the strange, almost rhapsodic way in which
 the girl moved about, carrying a great stew-jar to the oven, or looking in
 the saucepan. The atmosphere was different from that of his own home,
 where everything seemed so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly
 outside to the horse, that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in
 the garden, the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something
 had come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside the
 house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden in bondage,
 her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical. And her discoloured,
 old blue frock and her broken boots seemed only like the romantic rags of
 King Cophetua's beggar-maid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her, taking her all
 in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old frock hurt her. She
 resented his seeing everything. Even he knew that her stocking was not
 pulled up. She went into the scullery, blushing deeply. And afterwards her
 hands trembled slightly at her work. She nearly dropped all she handled.
 When her inside dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She
 resented that he saw so much.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she was needed
 at her work. She was too polite to leave him. Presently she excused
 herself and rose. After a while she looked into the tin saucepan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam started as if she had been stung.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "HAVE they, mother?" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't trusted them to
 you." She peered into the pan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated; she remained
 standing in the same spot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she answered, gripped tight in self-conscious shame, "I'm sure I
 looked at them five minutes since."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said the mother, "I know it's easily done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're not much burned," said Paul. "It doesn't matter, does it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Leivers looked at the youth with her brown, hurt eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It wouldn't matter but for the boys," she said to him. "Only Miriam knows
 what a trouble they make if the potatoes are 'caught'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then," thought Paul to himself, "you shouldn't let them make a trouble."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a while Edgar came in. He wore leggings, and his boots were covered
 with earth. He was rather small, rather formal, for a farmer. He glanced
 at Paul, nodded to him distantly, and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dinner ready?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nearly, Edgar," replied the mother apologetically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm ready for mine," said the young man, taking up the newspaper and
 reading. Presently the rest of the family trooped in. Dinner was served.
 The meal went rather brutally. The over-gentleness and apologetic tone of
 the mother brought out all the brutality of manners in the sons. Edgar
 tasted the potatoes, moved his mouth quickly like a rabbit, looked
 indignantly at his mother, and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These potatoes are burnt, mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Edgar. I forgot them for a minute. Perhaps you'll have bread if you
 can't eat them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar looked in anger across at Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was Miriam doing that she couldn't attend to them?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam looked up. Her mouth opened, her dark eyes blazed and winced, but
 she said nothing. She swallowed her anger and her shame, bowing her dark
 head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure she was trying hard," said the mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She hasn't got sense even to boil the potatoes," said Edgar. "What is she
 kept at home for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On'y for eating everything that's left in th' pantry," said Maurice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They don't forget that potato-pie against our Miriam," laughed the
 father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was utterly humiliated. The mother sat in silence, suffering, like
 some saint out of place at the brutal board.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It puzzled Paul. He wondered vaguely why all this intense feeling went
 running because of a few burnt potatoes. The mother exalted everything?even
 a bit of housework?to the plane of a religious trust. The sons
 resented this; they felt themselves cut away underneath, and they answered
 with brutality and also with a sneering superciliousness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was just opening out from childhood into manhood. This atmosphere,
 where everything took a religious value, came with a subtle fascination to
 him. There was something in the air. His own mother was logical. Here
 there was something different, something he loved, something that at times
 he hated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam quarrelled with her brothers fiercely. Later in the afternoon, when
 they had gone away again, her mother said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You disappointed me at dinner-time, Miriam."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl dropped her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are such BRUTES!" she suddenly cried, looking up with flashing eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But hadn't you promised not to answer them?" said the mother. "And I
 believed in you. I CAN'T stand it when you wrangle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But they're so hateful!" cried Miriam, "and?and LOW."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, dear. But how often have I asked you not to answer Edgar back? Can't
 you let him say what he likes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why should he say what he likes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you strong enough to bear it, Miriam, if even for my sake? Are you
 so weak that you must wrangle with them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Leivers stuck unflinchingly to this doctrine of "the other cheek".
 She could not instil it at all into the boys. With the girls she succeeded
 better, and Miriam was the child of her heart. The boys loathed the other
 cheek when it was presented to them. Miriam was often sufficiently lofty
 to turn it. Then they spat on her and hated her. But she walked in her
 proud humility, living within herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was always this feeling of jangle and discord in the Leivers family.
 Although the boys resented so bitterly this eternal appeal to their deeper
 feelings of resignation and proud humility, yet it had its effect on them.
 They could not establish between themselves and an outsider just the
 ordinary human feeling and unexaggerated friendship; they were always
 restless for the something deeper. Ordinary folk seemed shallow to them,
 trivial and inconsiderable. And so they were unaccustomed, painfully
 uncouth in the simplest social intercourse, suffering, and yet insolent in
 their superiority. Then beneath was the yearning for the soul-intimacy to
 which they could not attain because they were too dumb, and every approach
 to close connection was blocked by their clumsy contempt of other people.
 They wanted genuine intimacy, but they could not get even normally near to
 anyone, because they scorned to take the first steps, they scorned the
 triviality which forms common human intercourse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul fell under Mrs. Leivers's spell. Everything had a religious and
 intensified meaning when he was with her. His soul, hurt, highly
 developed, sought her as if for nourishment. Together they seemed to sift
 the vital fact from an experience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was her mother's daughter. In the sunshine of the afternoon mother
 and daughter went down the fields with him. They looked for nests. There
 was a jenny wren's in the hedge by the orchard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I DO want you to see this," said Mrs. Leivers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He crouched down and carefully put his finger through the thorns into the
 round door of the nest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's almost as if you were feeling inside the live body of the bird," he
 said, "it's so warm. They say a bird makes its nest round like a cup with
 pressing its breast on it. Then how did it make the ceiling round, I
 wonder?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nest seemed to start into life for the two women. After that, Miriam
 came to see it every day. It seemed so close to her. Again, going down the
 hedgeside with the girl, he noticed the celandines, scalloped splashes of
 gold, on the side of the ditch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I like them," he said, "when their petals go flat back with the sunshine.
 They seemed to be pressing themselves at the sun."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then the celandines ever after drew her with a little spell.
 Anthropomorphic as she was, she stimulated him into appreciating things
 thus, and then they lived for her. She seemed to need things kindling in
 her imagination or in her soul before she felt she had them. And she was
 cut off from ordinary life by her religious intensity which made the world
 for her either a nunnery garden or a paradise, where sin and knowledge
 were not, or else an ugly, cruel thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So it was in this atmosphere of subtle intimacy, this meeting in their
 common feeling for something in Nature, that their love started.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Personally, he was a long time before he realized her. For ten months he
 had to stay at home after his illness. For a while he went to Skegness
 with his mother, and was perfectly happy. But even from the seaside he
 wrote long letters to Mrs. Leivers about the shore and the sea. And he
 brought back his beloved sketches of the flat Lincoln coast, anxious for
 them to see. Almost they would interest the Leivers more than they
 interested his mother. It was not his art Mrs. Morel cared about; it was
 himself and his achievement. But Mrs. Leivers and her children were almost
 his disciples. They kindled him and made him glow to his work, whereas his
 mother's influence was to make him quietly determined, patient, dogged,
 unwearied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He soon was friends with the boys, whose rudeness was only superficial.
 They had all, when they could trust themselves, a strange gentleness and
 lovableness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you come with me on to the fallow?" asked Edgar, rather
 hesitatingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul went joyfully, and spent the afternoon helping to hoe or to single
 turnips with his friend. He used to lie with the three brothers in the hay
 piled up in the barn and tell them about Nottingham and about Jordan's. In
 return, they taught him to milk, and let him do little jobs?chopping
 hay or pulping turnips?just as much as he liked. At midsummer he
 worked all through hay-harvest with them, and then he loved them. The
 family was so cut off from the world actually. They seemed, somehow, like
 "<i>les derniers fils d'une race epuisee</i>". Though the lads were strong
 and healthy, yet they had all that over-sensitiveness and hanging-back
 which made them so lonely, yet also such close, delicate friends once
 their intimacy was won. Paul loved them dearly, and they him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam came later. But he had come into her life before she made any mark
 on his. One dull afternoon, when the men were on the land and the rest at
 school, only Miriam and her mother at home, the girl said to him, after
 having hesitated for some time:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you seen the swing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he answered. "Where?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the cowshed," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She always hesitated to offer or to show him anything. Men have such
 different standards of worth from women, and her dear things?the
 valuable things to her?her brothers had so often mocked or flouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on, then," he replied, jumping up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were two cowsheds, one on either side of the barn. In the lower,
 darker shed there was standing for four cows. Hens flew scolding over the
 manger-wall as the youth and girl went forward for the great thick rope
 which hung from the beam in the darkness overhead, and was pushed back
 over a peg in the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's something like a rope!" he exclaimed appreciatively; and he sat down
 on it, anxious to try it. Then immediately he rose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on, then, and have first go," he said to the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See," she answered, going into the barn, "we put some bags on the seat";
 and she made the swing comfortable for him. That gave her pleasure. He
 held the rope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on, then," he said to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I won't go first," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stood aside in her still, aloof fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You go," she pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Almost for the first time in her life she had the pleasure of giving up to
 a man, of spoiling him. Paul looked at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," he said, sitting down. "Mind out!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He set off with a spring, and in a moment was flying through the air,
 almost out of the door of the shed, the upper half of which was open,
 showing outside the drizzling rain, the filthy yard, the cattle standing
 disconsolate against the black cartshed, and at the back of all the
 grey-green wall of the wood. She stood below in her crimson tam-o'-shanter
 and watched. He looked down at her, and she saw his blue eyes sparkling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a treat of a swing," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was swinging through the air, every bit of him swinging, like a bird
 that swoops for joy of movement. And he looked down at her. Her crimson
 cap hung over her dark curls, her beautiful warm face, so still in a kind
 of brooding, was lifted towards him. It was dark and rather cold in the
 shed. Suddenly a swallow came down from the high roof and darted out of
 the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't know a bird was watching," he called.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He swung negligently. She could feel him falling and lifting through the
 air, as if he were lying on some force.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now I'll die," he said, in a detached, dreamy voice, as though he were
 the dying motion of the swing. She watched him, fascinated. Suddenly he
 put on the brake and jumped out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've had a long turn," he said. "But it's a treat of a swing?it's a
 real treat of a swing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was amused that he took a swing so seriously and felt so warmly
 over it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; you go on," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, don't you want one?" he asked, astonished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, not much. I'll have just a little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down, whilst he kept the bags in place for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's so ripping!" he said, setting her in motion. "Keep your heels up, or
 they'll bang the manger wall."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She felt the accuracy with which he caught her, exactly at the right
 moment, and the exactly proportionate strength of his thrust, and she was
 afraid. Down to her bowels went the hot wave of fear. She was in his
 hands. Again, firm and inevitable came the thrust at the right moment. She
 gripped the rope, almost swooning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha!" she laughed in fear. "No higher!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you're not a BIT high," he remonstrated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But no higher."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He heard the fear in her voice, and desisted. Her heart melted in hot pain
 when the moment came for him to thrust her forward again. But he left her
 alone. She began to breathe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Won't you really go any farther?" he asked. "Should I keep you there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; let me go by myself," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He moved aside and watched her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you're scarcely moving," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed slightly with shame, and in a moment got down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They say if you can swing you won't be sea-sick," he said, as he mounted
 again. "I don't believe I should ever be sea-sick."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Away he went. There was something fascinating to her in him. For the
 moment he was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff; not a particle of him
 that did not swing. She could never lose herself so, nor could her
 brothers. It roused a warmth in her. It was almost as if he were a flame
 that had lit a warmth in her whilst he swung in the middle air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And gradually the intimacy with the family concentrated for Paul on three
 persons?the mother, Edgar, and Miriam. To the mother he went for
 that sympathy and that appeal which seemed to draw him out. Edgar was his
 very close friend. And to Miriam he more or less condescended, because she
 seemed so humble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the girl gradually sought him out. If he brought up his sketch-book,
 it was she who pondered longest over the last picture. Then she would look
 up at him. Suddenly, her dark eyes alight like water that shakes with a
 stream of gold in the dark, she would ask:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why do I like this so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Always something in his breast shrank from these close, intimate, dazzled
 looks of hers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why DO you?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know. It seems so true."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's because?it's because there is scarcely any shadow in it; it's
 more shimmery, as if I'd painted the shimmering protoplasm in the leaves
 and everywhere, and not the stiffness of the shape. That seems dead to me.
 Only this shimmeriness is the real living. The shape is a dead crust. The
 shimmer is inside really."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she, with her little finger in her mouth, would ponder these sayings.
 They gave her a feeling of life again, and vivified things which had meant
 nothing to her. She managed to find some meaning in his struggling,
 abstract speeches. And they were the medium through which she came
 distinctly at her beloved objects.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another day she sat at sunset whilst he was painting some pine-trees which
 caught the red glare from the west. He had been quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There you are!" he said suddenly. "I wanted that. Now, look at them and
 tell me, are they pine trunks or are they red coals, standing-up pieces of
 fire in that darkness? There's God's burning bush for you, that burned not
 away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam looked, and was frightened. But the pine trunks were wonderful to
 her, and distinct. He packed his box and rose. Suddenly he looked at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why are you always sad?" he asked her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sad!" she exclaimed, looking up at him with startled, wonderful brown
 eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he replied. "You are always sad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am not?oh, not a bit!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But even your joy is like a flame coming off of sadness," he persisted.
 "You're never jolly, or even just all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she pondered. "I wonder?why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because you're not; because you're different inside, like a pine-tree,
 and then you flare up; but you're not just like an ordinary tree, with
 fidgety leaves and jolly?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got tangled up in his own speech; but she brooded on it, and he had a
 strange, roused sensation, as if his feelings were new. She got so near
 him. It was a strange stimulant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then sometimes he hated her. Her youngest brother was only five. He was a
 frail lad, with immense brown eyes in his quaint fragile face?one of
 Reynolds's "Choir of Angels", with a touch of elf. Often Miriam kneeled to
 the child and drew him to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, my Hubert!" she sang, in a voice heavy and surcharged with love. "Eh,
 my Hubert!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, folding him in her arms, she swayed slightly from side to side with
 love, her face half lifted, her eyes half closed, her voice drenched with
 love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't!" said the child, uneasy?"don't, Miriam!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; you love me, don't you?" she murmured deep in her throat, almost as
 if she were in a trance, and swaying also as if she were swooned in an
 ecstasy of love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't!" repeated the child, a frown on his clear brow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You love me, don't you?" she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you make such a FUSS for?" cried Paul, all in suffering because
 of her extreme emotion. "Why can't you be ordinary with him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She let the child go, and rose, and said nothing. Her intensity, which
 would leave no emotion on a normal plane, irritated the youth into a
 frenzy. And this fearful, naked contact of her on small occasions shocked
 him. He was used to his mother's reserve. And on such occasions he was
 thankful in his heart and soul that he had his mother, so sane and
 wholesome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the life of Miriam's body was in her eyes, which were usually dark as
 a dark church, but could flame with light like a conflagration. Her face
 scarcely ever altered from its look of brooding. She might have been one
 of the women who went with Mary when Jesus was dead. Her body was not
 flexible and living. She walked with a swing, rather heavily, her head
 bowed forward, pondering. She was not clumsy, and yet none of her
 movements seemed quite THE movement. Often, when wiping the dishes, she
 would stand in bewilderment and chagrin because she had pulled in two
 halves a cup or a tumbler. It was as if, in her fear and self-mistrust,
 she put too much strength into the effort. There was no looseness or
 abandon about her. Everything was gripped stiff with intensity, and her
 effort, overcharged, closed in on itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rarely varied from her swinging, forward, intense walk. Occasionally
 she ran with Paul down the fields. Then her eyes blazed naked in a kind of
 ecstasy that frightened him. But she was physically afraid. If she were
 getting over a stile, she gripped his hands in a little hard anguish, and
 began to lose her presence of mind. And he could not persuade her to jump
 from even a small height. Her eyes dilated, became exposed and
 palpitating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" she cried, half laughing in terror?"no!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shall!" he cried once, and, jerking her forward, he brought her
 falling from the fence. But her wild "Ah!" of pain, as if she were losing
 consciousness, cut him. She landed on her feet safely, and afterwards had
 courage in this respect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was very much dissatisfied with her lot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you like being at home?" Paul asked her, surprised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who would?" she answered, low and intense. "What is it? I'm all day
 cleaning what the boys make just as bad in five minutes. I don't WANT to
 be at home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you want, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want to do something. I want a chance like anybody else. Why should I,
 because I'm a girl, be kept at home and not allowed to be anything? What
 chance HAVE I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chance of what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of knowing anything?of learning, of doing anything. It's not fair,
 because I'm a woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed very bitter. Paul wondered. In his own home Annie was almost
 glad to be a girl. She had not so much responsibility; things were lighter
 for her. She never wanted to be other than a girl. But Miriam almost
 fiercely wished she were a man. And yet she hated men at the same time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's as well to be a woman as a man," he said, frowning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha! Is it? Men have everything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think women ought to be as glad to be women as men are to be
 men," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!"?she shook her head?"no! Everything the men have."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what do you want?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want to learn. Why SHOULD it be that I know nothing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! such as mathematics and French?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why SHOULDN'T I know mathematics? Yes!" she cried, her eye expanding in a
 kind of defiance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you can learn as much as I know," he said. "I'll teach you, if you
 like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her eyes dilated. She mistrusted him as teacher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her head had dropped, and she was sucking her finger broodingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said hesitatingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He used to tell his mother all these things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going to teach Miriam algebra," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," replied Mrs. Morel, "I hope she'll get fat on it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he went up to the farm on the Monday evening, it was drawing
 twilight. Miriam was just sweeping up the kitchen, and was kneeling at the
 hearth when he entered. Everyone was out but her. She looked round at him,
 flushed, her dark eyes shining, her fine hair falling about her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" she said, soft and musical. "I knew it was you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knew your step. Nobody treads so quick and firm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat down, sighing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ready to do some algebra?" he asked, drawing a little book from his
 pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He could feel her backing away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You said you wanted," he insisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To-night, though?" she faltered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I came on purpose. And if you want to learn it, you must begin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took up her ashes in the dustpan and looked at him, half tremulously,
 laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but to-night! You see, I haven't thought of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, my goodness! Take the ashes and come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went and sat on the stone bench in the back-yard, where the big
 milk-cans were standing, tipped up, to air. The men were in the cowsheds.
 He could hear the little sing-song of the milk spurting into the pails.
 Presently she came, bringing some big greenish apples.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know you like them," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a bite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sit down," he said, with his mouth full.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was short-sighted, and peered over his shoulder. It irritated him. He
 gave her the book quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here," he said. "It's only letters for figures. You put down 'a' instead
 of '2' or '6'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They worked, he talking, she with her head down on the book. He was quick
 and hasty. She never answered. Occasionally, when he demanded of her, "Do
 you see?" she looked up at him, her eyes wide with the half-laugh that
 comes of fear. "Don't you?" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had been too fast. But she said nothing. He questioned her more, then
 got hot. It made his blood rouse to see her there, as it were, at his
 mercy, her mouth open, her eyes dilated with laughter that was afraid,
 apologetic, ashamed. Then Edgar came along with two buckets of milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" he said. "What are you doing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Algebra," replied Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Algebra!" repeated Edgar curiously. Then he passed on with a laugh. Paul
 took a bite at his forgotten apple, looked at the miserable cabbages in
 the garden, pecked into lace by the fowls, and he wanted to pull them up.
 Then he glanced at Miriam. She was poring over the book, seemed absorbed
 in it, yet trembling lest she could not get at it. It made him cross. She
 was ruddy and beautiful. Yet her soul seemed to be intensely supplicating.
 The algebra-book she closed, shrinking, knowing he was angered; and at the
 same instant he grew gentle, seeing her hurt because she did not
 understand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But things came slowly to her. And when she held herself in a grip, seemed
 so utterly humble before the lesson, it made his blood rouse. He stormed
 at her, got ashamed, continued the lesson, and grew furious again, abusing
 her. She listened in silence. Occasionally, very rarely, she defended
 herself. Her liquid dark eyes blazed at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't give me time to learn it," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," he answered, throwing the book on the table and lighting a
 cigarette. Then, after a while, he went back to her repentant. So the
 lessons went. He was always either in a rage or very gentle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you tremble your SOUL before it for?" he cried. "You don't learn
 algebra with your blessed soul. Can't you look at it with your clear
 simple wits?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Often, when he went again into the kitchen, Mrs. Leivers would look at him
 reproachfully, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul, don't be so hard on Miriam. She may not be quick, but I'm sure she
 tries."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't help it," he said rather pitiably. "I go off like it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't mind me, Miriam, do you?" he asked of the girl later.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she reassured him in her beautiful deep tones?"no, I don't
 mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't mind me; it's my fault."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, in spite of himself, his blood began to boil with her. It was strange
 that no one else made him in such fury. He flared against her. Once he
 threw the pencil in her face. There was a silence. She turned her face
 slightly aside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't?" he began, but got no farther, feeling weak in all his
 bones. She never reproached him or was angry with him. He was often
 cruelly ashamed. But still again his anger burst like a bubble surcharged;
 and still, when he saw her eager, silent, as it were, blind face, he felt
 he wanted to throw the pencil in it; and still, when he saw her hand
 trembling and her mouth parted with suffering, his heart was scalded with
 pain for her. And because of the intensity to which she roused him, he
 sought her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he often avoided her and went with Edgar. Miriam and her brother were
 naturally antagonistic. Edgar was a rationalist, who was curious, and had
 a sort of scientific interest in life. It was a great bitterness to Miriam
 to see herself deserted by Paul for Edgar, who seemed so much lower. But
 the youth was very happy with her elder brother. The two men spent
 afternoons together on the land or in the loft doing carpentry, when it
 rained. And they talked together, or Paul taught Edgar the songs he
 himself had learned from Annie at the piano. And often all the men, Mr.
 Leivers as well, had bitter debates on the nationalizing of the land and
 similar problems. Paul had already heard his mother's views, and as these
 were as yet his own, he argued for her. Miriam attended and took part, but
 was all the time waiting until it should be over and a personal
 communication might begin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After all," she said within herself, "if the land were nationalized,
 Edgar and Paul and I would be just the same." So she waited for the youth
 to come back to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was studying for his painting. He loved to sit at home, alone with his
 mother, at night, working and working. She sewed or read. Then, looking up
 from his task, he would rest his eyes for a moment on her face, that was
 bright with living warmth, and he returned gladly to his work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can do my best things when you sit there in your rocking-chair,
 mother," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure!" she exclaimed, sniffing with mock scepticism. But she felt it
 was so, and her heart quivered with brightness. For many hours she sat
 still, slightly conscious of him labouring away, whilst she worked or read
 her book. And he, with all his soul's intensity directing his pencil,
 could feel her warmth inside him like strength. They were both very happy
 so, and both unconscious of it. These times, that meant so much, and which
 were real living, they almost ignored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was conscious only when stimulated. A sketch finished, he always wanted
 to take it to Miriam. Then he was stimulated into knowledge of the work he
 had produced unconsciously. In contact with Miriam he gained insight; his
 vision went deeper. From his mother he drew the life-warmth, the strength
 to produce; Miriam urged this warmth into intensity like a white light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he returned to the factory the conditions of work were better. He had
 Wednesday afternoon off to go to the Art School?Miss Jordan's
 provision?returning in the evening. Then the factory closed at six
 instead of eight on Thursday and Friday evenings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening in the summer Miriam and he went over the fields by Herod's
 Farm on their way from the library home. So it was only three miles to
 Willey Farm. There was a yellow glow over the mowing-grass, and the
 sorrel-heads burned crimson. Gradually, as they walked along the high
 land, the gold in the west sank down to red, the red to crimson, and then
 the chill blue crept up against the glow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They came out upon the high road to Alfreton, which ran white between the
 darkening fields. There Paul hesitated. It was two miles home for him, one
 mile forward for Miriam. They both looked up the road that ran in shadow
 right under the glow of the north-west sky. On the crest of the hill,
 Selby, with its stark houses and the up-pricked headstocks of the pit,
 stood in black silhouette small against the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at his watch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nine o'clock!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The pair stood, loth to part, hugging their books.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The wood is so lovely now," she said. "I wanted you to see it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He followed her slowly across the road to the white gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They grumble so if I'm late," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you're not doing anything wrong," she answered impatiently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He followed her across the nibbled pasture in the dusk. There was a
 coolness in the wood, a scent of leaves, of honeysuckle, and a twilight.
 The two walked in silence. Night came wonderfully there, among the throng
 of dark tree-trunks. He looked round, expectant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wanted to show him a certain wild-rose bush she had discovered. She
 knew it was wonderful. And yet, till he had seen it, she felt it had not
 come into her soul. Only he could make it her own, immortal. She was
 dissatisfied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dew was already on the paths. In the old oak-wood a mist was rising, and
 he hesitated, wondering whether one whiteness were a strand of fog or only
 campion-flowers pallid in a cloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the time they came to the pine-trees Miriam was getting very eager and
 very tense. Her bush might be gone. She might not be able to find it; and
 she wanted it so much. Almost passionately she wanted to be with him when
 he stood before the flowers. They were going to have a communion together?something
 that thrilled her, something holy. He was walking beside her in silence.
 They were very near to each other. She trembled, and he listened, vaguely
 anxious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Coming to the edge of the wood, they saw the sky in front, like
 mother-of-pearl, and the earth growing dark. Somewhere on the outermost
 branches of the pine-wood the honeysuckle was streaming scent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Down the middle path," she murmured, quivering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they turned the corner of the path she stood still. In the wide walk
 between the pines, gazing rather frightened, she could distinguish nothing
 for some moments; the greying light robbed things of their colour. Then
 she saw her bush.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" she cried, hastening forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was very still. The tree was tall and straggling. It had thrown its
 briers over a hawthorn-bush, and its long streamers trailed thick, right
 down to the grass, splashing the darkness everywhere with great spilt
 stars, pure white. In bosses of ivory and in large splashed stars the
 roses gleamed on the darkness of foliage and stems and grass. Paul and
 Miriam stood close together, silent, and watched. Point after point the
 steady roses shone out to them, seeming to kindle something in their
 souls. The dusk came like smoke around, and still did not put out the
 roses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul looked into Miriam's eyes. She was pale and expectant with wonder,
 her lips were parted, and her dark eyes lay open to him. His look seemed
 to travel down into her. Her soul quivered. It was the communion she
 wanted. He turned aside, as if pained. He turned to the bush.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They seem as if they walk like butterflies, and shake themselves," he
 said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at her roses. They were white, some incurved and holy, others
 expanded in an ecstasy. The tree was dark as a shadow. She lifted her hand
 impulsively to the flowers; she went forward and touched them in worship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us go," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a cool scent of ivory roses?a white, virgin scent.
 Something made him feel anxious and imprisoned. The two walked in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Till Sunday," he said quietly, and left her; and she walked home slowly,
 feeling her soul satisfied with the holiness of the night. He stumbled
 down the path. And as soon as he was out of the wood, in the free open
 meadow, where he could breathe, he started to run as fast as he could. It
 was like a delicious delirium in his veins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Always when he went with Miriam, and it grew rather late, he knew his
 mother was fretting and getting angry about him?why, he could not
 understand. As he went into the house, flinging down his cap, his mother
 looked up at the clock. She had been sitting thinking, because a chill to
 her eyes prevented her reading. She could feel Paul being drawn away by
 this girl. And she did not care for Miriam. "She is one of those who will
 want to suck a man's soul out till he has none of his own left," she said
 to herself; "and he is just such a gaby as to let himself be absorbed. She
 will never let him become a man; she never will." So, while he was away
 with Miriam, Mrs. Morel grew more and more worked up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She glanced at the clock and said, coldly and rather tired:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have been far enough to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His soul, warm and exposed from contact with the girl, shrank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must have been right home with her," his mother continued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He would not answer. Mrs. Morel, looking at him quickly, saw his hair was
 damp on his forehead with haste, saw him frowning in his heavy fashion,
 resentfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She must be wonderfully fascinating, that you can't get away from her,
 but must go trailing eight miles at this time of night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was hurt between the past glamour with Miriam and the knowledge that
 his mother fretted. He had meant not to say anything, to refuse to answer.
 But he could not harden his heart to ignore his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I DO like to talk to her," he answered irritably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there nobody else to talk to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You wouldn't say anything if I went with Edgar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know I should. You know, whoever you went with, I should say it was
 too far for you to go trailing, late at night, when you've been to
 Nottingham. Besides"?her voice suddenly flashed into anger and
 contempt?"it is disgusting?bits of lads and girls courting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is NOT courting," he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what else you call it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not! Do you think we SPOON and do? We only talk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Till goodness knows what time and distance," was the sarcastic rejoinder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul snapped at the laces of his boots angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you so mad about?" he asked. "Because you don't like her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't say I don't like her. But I don't hold with children keeping
 company, and never did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you don't mind our Annie going out with Jim Inger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They've more sense than you two."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Our Annie's not one of the deep sort."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He failed to see the meaning of this remark. But his mother looked tired.
 She was never so strong after William's death; and her eyes hurt her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "it's so pretty in the country. Mr. Sleath asked about
 you. He said he'd missed you. Are you a bit better?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ought to have been in bed a long time ago," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, mother, you know you wouldn't have gone before quarter-past ten."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, I should!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, little woman, you'd say anything now you're disagreeable with me,
 wouldn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He kissed her forehead that he knew so well: the deep marks between the
 brows, the rising of the fine hair, greying now, and the proud setting of
 the temples. His hand lingered on her shoulder after his kiss. Then he
 went slowly to bed. He had forgotten Miriam; he only saw how his mother's
 hair was lifted back from her warm, broad brow. And somehow, she was hurt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the next time he saw Miriam he said to her:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't let me be late to-night?not later than ten o'clock. My mother
 gets so upset."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam dropped her bead, brooding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why does she get upset?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because she says I oughtn't to be out late when I have to get up early."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well!" said Miriam, rather quietly, with just a touch of a sneer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He resented that. And he was usually late again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That there was any love growing between him and Miriam neither of them
 would have acknowledged. He thought he was too sane for such
 sentimentality, and she thought herself too lofty. They both were late in
 coming to maturity, and psychical ripeness was much behind even the
 physical. Miriam was exceedingly sensitive, as her mother had always been.
 The slightest grossness made her recoil almost in anguish. Her brothers
 were brutal, but never coarse in speech. The men did all the discussing of
 farm matters outside. But, perhaps, because of the continual business of
 birth and of begetting which goes on upon every farm, Miriam was the more
 hypersensitive to the matter, and her blood was chastened almost to
 disgust of the faintest suggestion of such intercourse. Paul took his
 pitch from her, and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and
 chaste fashion. It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a week, but he
 was happy. His painting went well, and life went well enough. On the Good
 Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone. There were three lads of
 his own age, then Annie and Arthur, Miriam and Geoffrey. Arthur,
 apprenticed as an electrician in Nottingham, was home for the holiday.
 Morel, as usual, was up early, whistling and sawing in the yard. At seven
 o'clock the family heard him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he
 talked with gusto to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my
 darling". He turned away several boys who came with more buns, telling
 them they had been "kested" by a little lass. Then Mrs. Morel got up, and
 the family straggled down. It was an immense luxury to everybody, this
 lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday. And Paul and
 Arthur read before breakfast, and had the meal unwashed, sitting in their
 shirt-sleeves. This was another holiday luxury. The room was warm.
 Everything felt free of care and anxiety. There was a sense of plenty in
 the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden. They were
 now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill Street home, which had
 been left soon after William had died. Directly came an excited cry from
 the garden:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul! Paul! come and look!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was his mother's voice. He threw down his book and went out. There was
 a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day, with a sharp
 wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away Bestwood began, with a
 jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which rose the church tower and
 the spire of the Congregational Chapel. And beyond went woods and hills,
 right away to the pale grey heights of the Pennine Chain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared among the
 young currant-bushes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come here!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What for?" he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come and see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees. Paul went up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her son went to her side. Under the fence, in a little bed, was a ravel of
 poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature bulbs, and three
 scyllas in bloom. Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, just see those!" she exclaimed. "I was looking at the currant
 bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something very blue; is it a
 bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you! Sugar-bag! Three glories of the
 snow, and such beauties! But where on earth did they come from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's a marvel, now! I THOUGHT I knew every weed and blade in this
 garden. But HAVEN'T they done well? You see, that gooseberry-bush just
 shelters them. Not nipped, not touched!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little blue flowers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're a glorious colour!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't they!" she cried. "I guess they come from Switzerland, where they
 say they have such lovely things. Fancy them against the snow! But where
 have they come from? They can't have BLOWN here, can they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash of bulbs to
 mature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you never told me," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And now, you see! I might have missed them. And I've never had a glory of
 the snow in my garden in my life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was full of excitement and elation. The garden was an endless joy to
 her. Paul was thankful for her sake at last to be in a house with a long
 garden that went down to a field. Every morning after breakfast she went
 out and was happy pottering about in it. And it was true, she knew every
 weed and blade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody turned up for the walk. Food was packed, and they set off, a
 merry, delighted party. They hung over the wall of the mill-race, dropped
 paper in the water on one side of the tunnel and watched it shoot out on
 the other. They stood on the foot-bridge over Boathouse Station and looked
 at the metals gleaming coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past six!" said
 Leonard, whose father was a signalman. "Lad, but she doesn't half buzz!"
 and the little party looked up the lines one way, to London, and the other
 way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch of these two magical places.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the public-houses to
 open. It was a town of idleness and lounging. At Stanton Gate the iron
 foundry blazed. Over everything there were great discussions. At Trowell
 they crossed again from Derbyshire into Nottinghamshire. They came to the
 Hemlock Stone at dinner-time. Its field was crowded with folk from
 Nottingham and Ilkeston.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had expected a venerable and dignified monument. They found a little,
 gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a decayed mushroom,
 standing out pathetically on the side of a field. Leonard and Dick
 immediately proceeded to carve their initials, "L. W." and "R. P.", in the
 old red sandstone; but Paul desisted, because he had read in the newspaper
 satirical remarks about initial-carvers, who could find no other road to
 immortality. Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look
 round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating lunch or
 sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor. It had yew-hedges
 and thick clumps and borders of yellow crocuses round the lawn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she looked gratefully.
 He had not seemed to belong to her among all these others; he was
 different then?not her Paul, who understood the slightest quiver of
 her innermost soul, but something else, speaking another language than
 hers. How it hurt her, and deadened her very perceptions. Only when he
 came right back to her, leaving his other, his lesser self, as she
 thought, would she feel alive again. And now he asked her to look at this
 garden, wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the
 field, she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up
 crocuses. A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her. It
 felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon they started home.
 Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did not fit in with the others; she
 could very rarely get into human relations with anyone: so her friend, her
 companion, her lover, was Nature. She saw the sun declining wanly. In the
 dusky, cold hedgerows were some red leaves. She lingered to gather them,
 tenderly, passionately. The love in her finger-tips caressed the leaves;
 the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road, and she hurried
 forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she came upon Paul, who stood bent
 over something, his mind fixed on it, working away steadily, patiently, a
 little hopelessly. She hesitated in her approach, to watch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond, one rift of
 rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make him stand out in
 dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm, as if the setting sun had
 given him to her. A deep pain took hold of her, and she knew she must love
 him. And she had discovered him, discovered in him a rare potentiality,
 discovered his loneliness. Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went
 slowly forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last he looked up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella was
 injured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done the damage himself,
 but that Geoffrey was responsible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles, made such a
 mountain of this molehill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know," he said quietly,
 still patiently working at the umbrella.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was the
 confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him. But there was about
 him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him, not even speak
 softly to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on," he said. "I can't do it;" and they went in silence along the
 road.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That same evening they were walking along under the trees by Nether Green.
 He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be struggling to convince
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves, the other
 does."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" she answered. "Like mother said to me when I was little, 'Love
 begets love.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very terrible thing,"
 she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but it IS?at least with most people," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong in herself. She
 always regarded that sudden coming upon him in the lane as a revelation.
 And this conversation remained graven in her mind as one of the letters of
 the law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time, he outraged the
 family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult, she stuck to
 him, and believed he was right. And at this time she dreamed dreams of
 him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams came again later on, developed to
 a more subtle psychological stage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion to Wingfield Manor.
 It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a train at Sethley Bridge, amid
 all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd. They left the train at Alfreton.
 Paul was interested in the street and in the colliers with their dogs.
 Here was a new race of miners. Miriam did not live till they came to the
 church. They were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food,
 for fear of being turned out. Leonard, a comic, thin fellow, went first;
 Paul, who would have died rather than be sent back, went last. The place
 was decorated for Easter. In the font hundreds of white narcissi seemed to
 be growing. The air was dim and coloured from the windows and thrilled
 with a subtle scent of lilies and narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's
 soul came into a glow. Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he
 was sensitive to the feel of the place. Miriam turned to him. He answered.
 They were together. He would not go beyond the Communion-rail. She loved
 him for that. Her soul expanded into prayer beside him. He felt the
 strange fascination of shadowy religious places. All his latent mysticism
 quivered into life. She was drawn to him. He was a prayer along with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once became awkward
 in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor. All
 things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm and enlivening.
 Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was tip-top full with
 happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft, atmospheric grey of the
 castle walls, the gentleness of everything near the ruin, was perfect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls are blank and
 calm. The young folk were in raptures. They went in trepidation, almost
 afraid that the delight of exploring this ruin might be denied them. In
 the first courtyard, within the high broken walls, were farm-carts, with
 their shafts lying idle on the ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant
 with gold-red rust. It was very still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through the fine clean
 arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy. Here on the pavement, where
 the hall had been, an old thorn tree was budding. All kinds of strange
 openings and broken rooms were in the shadow around them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin. This time the
 girls went with the boys, who could act as guides and expositors. There
 was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering, where they say Mary
 Queen of Scots was imprisoned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice, as she
 climbed the hollow stairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism like anything. I
 reckon they treated her rottenly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I don't. She was only lively."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind, blowing
 through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft, and filled the girl's
 skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed, until he took the hem of
 her dress and held it down for her. He did it perfectly simply, as he
 would have picked up her glove. She remembered this always.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out, old and handsome.
 Also, there were a few chill gillivers, in pale cold bud. Miriam wanted to
 lean over for some ivy, but he would not let her. Instead, she had to wait
 behind him, and take from him each spray as he gathered it and held it to
 her, each one separately, in the purest manner of chivalry. The tower
 seemed to rock in the wind. They looked over miles and miles of wooded
 country, and country with gleams of pasture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The crypt underneath the manor was beautiful, and in perfect preservation.
 Paul made a drawing: Miriam stayed with him. She was thinking of Mary
 Queen of Scots looking with her strained, hopeless eyes, that could not
 understand misery, over the hills whence no help came, or sitting in this
 crypt, being told of a God as cold as the place she sat in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They set off again gaily, looking round on their beloved manor that stood
 so clean and big on its hill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Supposing you could have THAT farm," said Paul to Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wouldn't it be lovely to come and see you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were now in the bare country of stone walls, which he loved, and
 which, though only ten miles from home, seemed so foreign to Miriam. The
 party was straggling. As they were crossing a large meadow that sloped
 away from the sun, along a path embedded with innumerable tiny glittering
 points, Paul, walking alongside, laced his fingers in the strings of the
 bag Miriam was carrying, and instantly she felt Annie behind, watchful and
 jealous. But the meadow was bathed in a glory of sunshine, and the path
 was jewelled, and it was seldom that he gave her any sign. She held her
 fingers very still among the strings of the bag, his fingers touching; and
 the place was golden as a vision.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last they came into the straggling grey village of Crich, that lies
 high. Beyond the village was the famous Crich Stand that Paul could see
 from the garden at home. The party pushed on. Great expanse of country
 spread around and below. The lads were eager to get to the top of the
 hill. It was capped by a round knoll, half of which was by now cut away,
 and on the top of which stood an ancient monument, sturdy and squat, for
 signalling in old days far down into the level lands of Nottinghamshire
 and Leicestershire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was blowing so hard, high up there in the exposed place, that the only
 way to be safe was to stand nailed by the wind to the wan of the tower. At
 their feet fell the precipice where the limestone was quarried away. Below
 was a jumble of hills and tiny villages?Mattock, Ambergate, Stoney
 Middleton. The lads were eager to spy out the church of Bestwood, far away
 among the rather crowded country on the left. They were disgusted that it
 seemed to stand on a plain. They saw the hills of Derbyshire fall into the
 monotony of the Midlands that swept away South.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was somewhat scared by the wind, but the lads enjoyed it. They went
 on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell. All the food was eaten, everybody
 was hungry, and there was very little money to get home with. But they
 managed to procure a loaf and a currant-loaf, which they hacked to pieces
 with shut-knives, and ate sitting on the wall near the bridge, watching
 the bright Derwent rushing by, and the brakes from Matlock pulling up at
 the inn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was now pale with weariness. He had been responsible for the party
 all day, and now he was done. Miriam understood, and kept close to him,
 and he left himself in her hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had an hour to wait at Ambergate Station. Trains came, crowded with
 excursionists returning to Manchester, Birmingham, and London.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We might be going there?folk easily might think we're going that
 far," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They got back rather late. Miriam, walking home with Geoffrey, watched the
 moon rise big and red and misty. She felt something was fulfilled in her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had an elder sister, Agatha, who was a school-teacher. Between the two
 girls was a feud. Miriam considered Agatha worldly. And she wanted herself
 to be a school-teacher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One Saturday afternoon Agatha and Miriam were upstairs dressing. Their
 bedroom was over the stable. It was a low room, not very large, and bare.
 Miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction of Veronese's "St.
 Catherine". She loved the woman who sat in the window, dreaming. Her own
 windows were too small to sit in. But the front one was dripped over with
 honeysuckle and virginia creeper, and looked upon the tree-tops of the
 oak-wood across the yard, while the little back window, no bigger than a
 handkerchief, was a loophole to the east, to the dawn beating up against
 the beloved round hills.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two sisters did not talk much to each other. Agatha, who was fair and
 small and determined, had rebelled against the home atmosphere, against
 the doctrine of "the other cheek". She was out in the world now, in a fair
 way to be independent. And she insisted on worldly values, on appearance,
 on manners, on position, which Miriam would fain have ignored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both girls liked to be upstairs, out of the way, when Paul came. They
 preferred to come running down, open the stair-foot door, and see him
 watching, expectant of them. Miriam stood painfully pulling over her head
 a rosary he had given her. It caught in the fine mesh of her hair. But at
 last she had it on, and the red-brown wooden beads looked well against her
 cool brown neck. She was a well-developed girl, and very handsome. But in
 the little looking-glass nailed against the whitewashed wall she could
 only see a fragment of herself at a time. Agatha had bought a little
 mirror of her own, which she propped up to suit herself. Miriam was near
 the window. Suddenly she heard the well-known click of the chain, and she
 saw Paul fling open the gate, push his bicycle into the yard. She saw him
 look at the house, and she shrank away. He walked in a nonchalant fashion,
 and his bicycle went with him as if it were a live thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul's come!" she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you glad?" said Agatha cuttingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam stood still in amazement and bewilderment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, aren't you?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but I'm not going to let him see it, and think I wanted him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was startled. She heard him putting his bicycle in the stable
 underneath, and talking to Jimmy, who had been a pit-horse, and who was
 seedy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Jimmy my lad, how are ter? Nobbut sick an' sadly, like? Why, then,
 it's a shame, my owd lad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted its head from
 the lad's caress. How she loved to listen when he thought only the horse
 could hear. But there was a serpent in her Eden. She searched earnestly in
 herself to see if she wanted Paul Morel. She felt there would be some
 disgrace in it. Full of twisted feeling, she was afraid she did want him.
 She stood self-convicted. Then came an agony of new shame. She shrank
 within herself in a coil of torture. Did she want Paul Morel, and did he
 know she wanted him? What a subtle infamy upon her. She felt as if her
 whole soul coiled into knots of shame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Agatha was dressed first, and ran downstairs. Miriam heard her greet the
 lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes became with that tone.
 She herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him in such wise. Yet
 there she stood under the self-accusation of wanting him, tied to that
 stake of torture. In bitter perplexity she kneeled down and prayed:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O Lord, let me not love Paul Morel. Keep me from loving him, if I ought
 not to love him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something anomalous in the prayer arrested her. She lifted her head and
 pondered. How could it be wrong to love him? Love was God's gift. And yet
 it caused her shame. That was because of him, Paul Morel. But, then, it
 was not his affair, it was her own, between herself and God. She was to be
 a sacrifice. But it was God's sacrifice, not Paul Morel's or her own.
 After a few minutes she hid her face in the pillow again, and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Lord, if it is Thy will that I should love him, make me love him?as
 Christ would, who died for the souls of men. Make me love him splendidly,
 because he is Thy son."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She remained kneeling for some time, quite still, and deeply moved, her
 black hair against the red squares and the lavender-sprigged squares of
 the patchwork quilt. Prayer was almost essential to her. Then she fell
 into that rapture of self-sacrifice, identifying herself with a God who
 was sacrificed, which gives to so many human souls their deepest bliss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she went downstairs Paul was lying back in an armchair, holding forth
 with much vehemence to Agatha, who was scorning a little painting he had
 brought to show her. Miriam glanced at the two, and avoided their levity.
 She went into the parlour to be alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was tea-time before she was able to speak to Paul, and then her manner
 was so distant he thought he had offended her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam discontinued her practice of going each Thursday evening to the
 library in Bestwood. After calling for Paul regularly during the whole
 spring, a number of trifling incidents and tiny insults from his family
 awakened her to their attitude towards her, and she decided to go no more.
 So she announced to Paul one evening she would not call at his house again
 for him on Thursday nights.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" he asked, very short.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing. Only I'd rather not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," she faltered, "if you'd care to meet me, we could still go
 together."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Meet you where?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Somewhere?where you like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shan't meet you anywhere. I don't see why you shouldn't keep calling
 for me. But if you won't, I don't want to meet you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the Thursday evenings which had been so precious to her, and to him,
 were dropped. He worked instead. Mrs. Morel sniffed with satisfaction at
 this arrangement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He would not have it that they were lovers. The intimacy between them had
 been kept so abstract, such a matter of the soul, all thought and weary
 struggle into consciousness, that he saw it only as a platonic friendship.
 He stoutly denied there was anything else between them. Miriam was silent,
 or else she very quietly agreed. He was a fool who did not know what was
 happening to himself. By tacit agreement they ignored the remarks and
 insinuations of their acquaintances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We aren't lovers, we are friends," he said to her. "WE know it. Let them
 talk. What does it matter what they say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes, as they were walking together, she slipped her arm timidly into
 his. But he always resented it, and she knew it. It caused a violent
 conflict in him. With Miriam he was always on the high plane of
 abstraction, when his natural fire of love was transmitted into the fine
 stream of thought. She would have it so. If he were jolly and, as she put
 it, flippant, she waited till he came back to her, till the change had
 taken place in him again, and he was wrestling with his own soul,
 frowning, passionate in his desire for understanding. And in this passion
 for understanding her soul lay close to his; she had him all to herself.
 But he must be made abstract first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, if she put her arm in his, it caused him almost torture. His
 consciousness seemed to split. The place where she was touching him ran
 hot with friction. He was one internecine battle, and he became cruel to
 her because of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening in midsummer Miriam called at the house, warm from climbing.
 Paul was alone in the kitchen; his mother could be heard moving about
 upstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come and look at the sweet-peas," he said to the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went into the garden. The sky behind the townlet and the church was
 orange-red; the flower-garden was flooded with a strange warm light that
 lifted every leaf into significance. Paul passed along a fine row of
 sweet-peas, gathering a blossom here and there, all cream and pale blue.
 Miriam followed, breathing the fragrance. To her, flowers appealed with
 such strength she felt she must make them part of herself. When she bent
 and breathed a flower, it was as if she and the flower were loving each
 other. Paul hated her for it. There seemed a sort of exposure about the
 action, something too intimate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had got a fair bunch, they returned to the house. He listened for
 a moment to his mother's quiet movement upstairs, then he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come here, and let me pin them in for you." He arranged them two or three
 at a time in the bosom of her dress, stepping back now and then to see the
 effect. "You know," he said, taking the pin out of his mouth, "a woman
 ought always to arrange her flowers before her glass."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam laughed. She thought flowers ought to be pinned in one's dress
 without any care. That Paul should take pains to fix her flowers for her
 was his whim.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was rather offended at her laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some women do?those who look decent," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam laughed again, but mirthlessly, to hear him thus mix her up with
 women in a general way. From most men she would have ignored it. But from
 him it hurt her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had nearly finished arranging the flowers when he heard his mother's
 footstep on the stairs. Hurriedly he pushed in the last pin and turned
 away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't let mater know," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam picked up her books and stood in the doorway looking with chagrin
 at the beautiful sunset. She would call for Paul no more, she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-evening, Mrs. Morel," she said, in a deferential way. She sounded as
 if she felt she had no right to be there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, is it you, Miriam?" replied Mrs. Morel coolly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Paul insisted on everybody's accepting his friendship with the girl,
 and Mrs. Morel was too wise to have any open rupture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not till he was twenty years old that the family could ever afford
 to go away for a holiday. Mrs. Morel had never been away for a holiday,
 except to see her sister, since she had been married. Now at last Paul had
 saved enough money, and they were all going. There was to be a party: some
 of Annie's friends, one friend of Paul's, a young man in the same office
 where William had previously been, and Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and his mother debated it
 endlessly between them. They wanted a furnished cottage for two weeks. She
 thought one week would be enough, but he insisted on two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they wished
 for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation. Paul was wild
 with joy for his mother's sake. She would have a real holiday now. He and
 she sat at evening picturing what it would be like. Annie came in, and
 Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty. There was wild rejoicing and anticipation.
 Paul told Miriam. She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morel's
 house rang with excitement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train. Paul suggested
 that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it was so far for her to
 walk. She came down for supper. Everybody was so excited that even Miriam
 was accepted with warmth. But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in
 the family became close and tight. He had discovered a poem by Jean
 Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe, and so he must read it to Miriam. He
 would never have got so far in the direction of sentimentality as to read
 poetry to his own family. But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat
 on the sofa absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by
 him, when he was present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair. She
 was going to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended, Morel with
 his head cocked on one side, like somebody listening to a sermon and
 feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his head over the book. He had
 got now all the audience he cared for. And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost
 contested with Miriam who should listen best and win his favour. He was in
 very high feather.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what IS the 'Bride of Enderby' that the
 bells are supposed to ring?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning against
 water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood," he replied.
 He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was, but he would never
 have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk. They listened and
 believed him. He believed himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o' the
 Forest'?and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How?" said Annie. "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung backwards or
 forwards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," he said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up to the high
 one?der?der?der?der?der?der?der?der!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thought so too. Then,
 waiting a minute, he continued the poem.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. "But I wish everything
 that's written weren't so sad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for," said Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam rose to help with the pots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let ME help to wash up," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly not," cried Annie. "You sit down again. There aren't many."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down again to look
 at the book with Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was master of the party; his father was no good. And great tortures he
 suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby instead of at
 Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage. His bold little
 mother did that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here!" she cried to a man. "Here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two shillings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, how far is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A good way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't believe it," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one old seaside
 carriage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each, and if it were a
 tramcar?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it this? Now, this is it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There was a universal sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel. "I WAS frightened."
 They drove on and on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last they descended at a house that stood alone over the dyke by the
 highroad. There was wild excitement because they had to cross a little
 bridge to get into the front garden. But they loved the house that lay so
 solitary, with a sea-meadow on one side, and immense expanse of land
 patched in white barley, yellow oats, red wheat, and green root-crops,
 flat and stretching level to the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show. The total expenses?lodging,
 food, everything?was sixteen shillings a week per person. He and
 Leonard went bathing in the mornings. Morel was wandering abroad quite
 early.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece of
 bread-and-butter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at the
 breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husband was blind,
 and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washed the pots in the
 kitchen and made the beds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now you work."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Work!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking about!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He loved to go with her across the fields to the village and the sea. She
 was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her for being a baby. On the
 whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the others went
 to the "Coons". Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam, so he thought
 they were to himself also, and he preached priggishly to Annie about the
 fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, too, knew all their songs, and sang
 them along the roads roisterously. And if he found himself listening, the
 stupidity pleased him very much. Yet to Annie he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody with more
 gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen." And to Miriam he
 said, with much scorn of Annie and the others: "I suppose they're at the
 'Coons'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straight chin
 that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn. She
 always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang, even when
 it was:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Come down lover's lane
 For a walk with me, talk with me."
</pre>
 <p>
 Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at the "Coons",
 she had him to herself. He talked to her endlessly about his love of
 horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky and land in Lincolnshire,
 meant to him the eternality of the will, just as the bowed Norman arches
 of the church, repeating themselves, meant the dogged leaping forward of
 the persistent human soul, on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction
 to the perpendicular lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt
 up at heaven and touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine.
 Himself, he said, was Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even
 to that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore of sand towards
 Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ran in a hiss of foam along
 the coast. It was a warm evening. There was not a figure but themselves on
 the far reaches of sand, no noise but the sound of the sea. Paul loved to
 see it clanging at the land. He loved to feel himself between the noise of
 it and the silence of the sandy shore. Miriam was with him. Everything
 grew very intense. It was quite dark when they turned again. The way home
 was through a gap in the sandhills, and then along a raised grass road
 between two dykes. The country was black and still. From behind the
 sandhills came the whisper of the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence.
 Suddenly he started. The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame,
 and he could scarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at them
 from the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy moon, the
 only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level. His heart beat
 heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for ever in shadow. Her
 face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watching him unseen. But
 she was brooding. She was slightly afraid?deeply moved and
 religious. That was her best state. He was impotent against it. His blood
 was concentrated like a flame in his chest. But he could not get across to
 her. There were flashes in his blood. But somehow she ignored them. She
 was expecting some religious state in him. Still yearning, she was half
 aware of his passion, and gazed at him, troubled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" she murmured again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the moon," he answered, frowning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she assented. "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious about him. The
 crisis was past.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturally so young,
 and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he wanted to crush her
 on to his breast to ease the ache there. He was afraid of her. The fact
 that he might want her as a man wants a woman had in him been suppressed
 into a shame. When she shrank in her convulsed, coiled torture from the
 thought of such a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now
 this "purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could
 scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss, and
 then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moon and did not
 speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for she seemed in some way to
 make him despise himself. Looking ahead?he saw the one light in the
 darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother as they
 entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does that matter!" he cried irritably. "I can go a walk if I like,
 can't I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I should have thought you could get in to supper with the rest," said
 Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall please myself," he retorted. "It's not LATE. I shall do as I
 like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then DO as you like." And she
 took no further notice of him that evening. Which he pretended neither to
 notice nor to care about, but sat reading. Miriam read also, obliterating
 herself. Mrs. Morel hated her for making her son like this. She watched
 Paul growing irritable, priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the
 blame on Miriam. Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam
 had no friend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,
 because she despised the triviality of these other people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease and naturalness.
 And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation.

 CHAPTER VIII
 </h2>
 <h3>
 STRIFE IN LOVE
 </h3>
 <p>
 ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical plant
 at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chance of getting on.
 But he was wild and restless. He did not drink nor gamble. Yet he somehow
 contrived to get into endless scrapes, always through some hot-headed
 thoughtlessness. Either he went rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or
 he stayed in Nottingham all night instead of coming home, or he
 miscalculated his dive into the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest
 into one mass of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had not been at his work many months when again he did not come home
 one night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do not," replied his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is a fool," said Paul. "And if he DID anything I shouldn't mind. But
 no, he simply can't come away from a game of whist, or else he must see a
 girl home from the skating-rink?quite proprietously?and so
 can't get home. He's a fool."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know that it would make it any better if he did something to make
 us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went on with breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you ask that for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She may do?but I don't. No, he wearies me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you'd actually rather he was good?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often. She saw
 the sunshine going out of him, and she resented it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they were finishing breakfast came the postman with a letter from
 Derby. Mrs. Morel screwed up her eyes to look at the address.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Give it here, blind eye!" exclaimed her son, snatching it away from her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She started, and almost boxed his ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's from your son, Arthur," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What now?!" cried Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'My dearest Mother,'" Paul read, "'I don't know what made me such a fool.
 I want you to come and fetch me back from here. I came with Jack Bredon
 yesterday, instead of going to work, and enlisted. He said he was sick of
 wearing the seat of a stool out, and, like the idiot you know I am, I came
 away with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'I have taken the King's shilling, but perhaps if you came for me they
 would let me go back with you. I was a fool when I did it. I don't want to
 be in the army. My dear mother, I am nothing but a trouble to you. But if
 you get me out of this, I promise I will have more sense and
 consideration. . . .'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel sat down in her rocking-chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, NOW," she cried, "let him stop!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Paul, "let him stop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was silence. The mother sat with her hands folded in her apron, her
 face set, thinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I'm not SICK!" she cried suddenly. "Sick!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," said Paul, beginning to frown, "you're not going to worry your soul
 out about this, do you hear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose I'm to take it as a blessing," she flashed, turning on her son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're not going to mount it up to a tragedy, so there," he retorted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The FOOL!?the young fool!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He'll look well in uniform," said Paul irritatingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother turned on him like a fury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, will he!" she cried. "Not in my eyes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He should get in a cavalry regiment; he'll have the time of his life, and
 will look an awful swell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swell!?SWELL!?a mighty swell idea indeed!?a common
 soldier!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Paul, "what am I but a common clerk?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A good deal, my boy!" cried his mother, stung.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At any rate, a MAN, and not a thing in a red coat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't mind being in a red coat?or dark blue, that would suit
 me better?if they didn't boss me about too much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But his mother had ceased to listen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just as he was getting on, or might have been getting on, at his job?a
 young nuisance?here he goes and ruins himself for life. What good
 will he be, do you think, after THIS?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It may lick him into shape beautifully," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lick him into shape!?lick what marrow there WAS out of his bones. A
 SOLDIER!?a common SOLDIER!?nothing but a body that makes
 movements when it hears a shout! It's a fine thing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't understand why it upsets you," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, perhaps you can't. But I understand"; and she sat back in her chair,
 her chin in one hand, holding her elbow with the other, brimmed up with
 wrath and chagrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And shall you go to Derby?" asked Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's no good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll see for myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why on earth don't you let him stop. It's just what he wants."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course," cried the mother, "YOU know what he wants!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She got ready and went by the first train to Derby, where she saw her son
 and the sergeant. It was, however, no good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Morel was having his dinner in the evening, she said suddenly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've had to go to Derby to-day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The miner turned up his eyes, showing the whites in his black face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has ter, lass. What took thee there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That Arthur!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?an' what's agate now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's only enlisted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel put down his knife and leaned back in his chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay," he said, "that he niver 'as!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And is going down to Aldershot tomorrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" exclaimed the miner. "That's a winder." He considered it a moment,
 said "H'm!" and proceeded with his dinner. Suddenly his face contracted
 with wrath. "I hope he may never set foot i' my house again," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The idea!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Saying such a thing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do," repeated Morel. "A fool as runs away for a soldier, let 'im look
 after 'issen; I s'll do no more for 'im."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A fat sight you have done as it is," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Morel was almost ashamed to go to his public-house that evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, did you go?" said Paul to his mother when he came home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And could you see him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what did he say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He blubbered when I came away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so did I, so you needn't 'h'm'!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel fretted after her son. She knew he would not like the army. He
 did not. The discipline was intolerable to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the doctor," she said with some pride to Paul, "said he was perfectly
 proportioned?almost exactly; all his measurements were correct. He
 IS good-looking, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's awfully nice-looking. But he doesn't fetch the girls like William,
 does he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; it's a different character. He's a good deal like his father,
 irresponsible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To console his mother, Paul did not go much to Willey Farm at this time.
 And in the autumn exhibition of students' work in the Castle he had two
 studies, a landscape in water-colour and a still life in oil, both of
 which had first-prize awards. He was highly excited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you think I've got for my pictures, mother?" he asked, coming
 home one evening. She saw by his eyes he was glad. Her face flushed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, how should I know, my boy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A first prize for those glass jars?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And a first prize for that sketch up at Willey Farm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Both first?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a rosy, bright look about her, though she said nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's nice," he said, "isn't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you praise me up to the skies?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should have the trouble of dragging you down again," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she was full of joy, nevertheless. William had brought her his
 sporting trophies. She kept them still, and she did not forgive his death.
 Arthur was handsome?at least, a good specimen?and warm and
 generous, and probably would do well in the end. But Paul was going to
 distinguish himself. She had a great belief in him, the more because he
 was unaware of his own powers. There was so much to come out of him. Life
 for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled. Not for
 nothing had been her struggle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several times during the exhibition Mrs. Morel went to the Castle unknown
 to Paul. She wandered down the long room looking at the other exhibits.
 Yes, they were good. But they had not in them a certain something which
 she demanded for her satisfaction. Some made her jealous, they were so
 good. She looked at them a long time trying to find fault with them. Then
 suddenly she had a shock that made her heart beat. There hung Paul's
 picture! She knew it as if it were printed on her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Name?Paul Morel?First Prize."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It looked so strange, there in public, on the walls of the Castle gallery,
 where in her lifetime she had seen so many pictures. And she glanced round
 to see if anyone had noticed her again in front of the same sketch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she felt a proud woman. When she met well-dressed ladies going home to
 the Park, she thought to herself:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you look very well?but I wonder if YOUR son has two first
 prizes in the Castle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she walked on, as proud a little woman as any in Nottingham. And Paul
 felt he had done something for her, if only a trifle. All his work was
 hers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day, as he was going up Castle Gate, he met Miriam. He had seen her on
 the Sunday, and had not expected to meet her in town. She was walking with
 a rather striking woman, blonde, with a sullen expression, and a defiant
 carriage. It was strange how Miriam, in her bowed, meditative bearing,
 looked dwarfed beside this woman with the handsome shoulders. Miriam
 watched Paul searchingly. His gaze was on the stranger, who ignored him.
 The girl saw his masculine spirit rear its head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" he said, "you didn't tell me you were coming to town."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," replied Miriam, half apologetically. "I drove in to Cattle Market
 with father."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at her companion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've told you about Mrs. Dawes," said Miriam huskily; she was nervous.
 "Clara, do you know Paul?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I've seen him before," replied Mrs. Dawes indifferently, as she
 shook hands with him. She had scornful grey eyes, a skin like white honey,
 and a full mouth, with a slightly lifted upper lip that did not know
 whether it was raised in scorn of all men or out of eagerness to be
 kissed, but which believed the former. She carried her head back, as if
 she had drawn away in contempt, perhaps from men also. She wore a large,
 dowdy hat of black beaver, and a sort of slightly affected simple dress
 that made her look rather sack-like. She was evidently poor, and had not
 much taste. Miriam usually looked nice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where have you seen me?" Paul asked of the woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him as if she would not trouble to answer. Then:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Walking with Louie Travers," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Louie was one of the "Spiral" girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, do you know her?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not answer. He turned to Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where are you going?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the Castle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What train are you going home by?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am driving with father. I wish you could come too. What time are you
 free?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know not till eight to-night, damn it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And directly the two women moved on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul remembered that Clara Dawes was the daughter of an old friend of Mrs.
 Leivers. Miriam had sought her out because she had once been Spiral
 overseer at Jordan's, and because her husband, Baxter Dawes, was smith for
 the factory, making the irons for cripple instruments, and so on. Through
 her Miriam felt she got into direct contact with Jordan's, and could
 estimate better Paul's position. But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her
 husband, and had taken up Women's Rights. She was supposed to be clever.
 It interested Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a man of thirty-one or
 thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul's corner?a big,
 well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome. There was a peculiar
 similarity between himself and his wife. He had the same white skin, with
 a clear, golden tinge. His hair was of soft brown, his moustache was
 golden. And he had a similar defiance in his bearing and manner. But then
 came the difference. His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were
 dissolute. They protruded very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in
 a way that was half hate. His mouth, too, was sensual. His whole manner
 was of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody down who
 disapproved of him?perhaps because he really disapproved of himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,
 deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind the counter and
 talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty, with a kind of rottenness.
 Again he found the youth with his cool, critical gaze fixed on his face.
 The smith started round as if he had been stung.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why yer?!" shouted Dawes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating voice which
 means, "He's only one of your good little sops who can't help it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time he came through
 with the same curious criticism, glancing away before he met the smith's
 eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated each other in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband the home had
 been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother. Dawes lodged
 with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, and somehow Paul
 knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman. She was a
 handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and yet flushed if he
 walked along to the station with her as she went home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening. She had a
 fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others, except her
 father and mother and the young children, had gone out, so the two had the
 parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room. There were three of
 Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo was on the mantelpiece.
 On the table and on the high old rosewood piano were bowls of coloured
 leaves. He sat in the armchair, she crouched on the hearthrug near his
 feet. The glow was warm on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there
 like a devotee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said, in a deep tone,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like her for some
 things. IS she disagreeable?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What with?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions so soon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I should have thought she had enough fight in her to match him," he
 said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam bowed her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay?" she queried satirically. "What makes you think so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at her mouth?made for passion?and the very setback of
 her throat?" He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam bowed a little lower.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know?her skin and the texture of her?and her?I
 don't know?there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I
 appreciate her as an artist, that's all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way. It
 irritated him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't?you can't?not really."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then what?" she asked slowly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, I don't know?perhaps you like her because she's got a grudge
 against men."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking Mrs. Dawes, but
 this did not occur to him. They were silent. There had come into his
 forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him,
 particularly when he was with Miriam. She longed to smooth it away, and
 she was afraid of it. It seemed the stamp of a man who was not her man in
 Paul Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl. He reached
 over and pulled out a bunch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would you look like
 some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed with a naked, painful sound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why can't you laugh?" he said. "You never laugh laughter. You only laugh
 when something is odd or incongruous, and then it almost seems to hurt
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute?just for one
 minute. I feel as if it would set something free."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But"?and she looked up at him with eyes frightened and struggling?"I
 do laugh at you?I DO."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laugh I could always
 cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering. Oh, you make me knit the
 brows of my very soul and cogitate."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Slowly she shook her head despairingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure I don't want to," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise." But he
 saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tear him in two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels like a
 disembodied spirit then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was still another silence. This peculiar sadness between them
 thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with his eyes gone dark, and
 looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You make me so spiritual!" he lamented. "And I don't want to be
 spiritual."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked up at him
 almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in her great dark eyes,
 and there was the same yearning appeal upon her. If he could have kissed
 her in abstract purity he would have done so. But he could not kiss her
 thus?and she seemed to leave no other way. And she yearned to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He gave a brief laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some?some Verlaine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation. And she rose and
 got the books. And her rather red, nervous hands looked so pitiful, he was
 mad to comfort her and kiss her. But then be dared not?or could not.
 There was something prevented him. His kisses were wrong for her. They
 continued the reading till ten o'clock, when they went into the kitchen,
 and Paul was natural and jolly again with the father and mother. His eyes
 were dark and shining; there was a kind of fascination about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front wheel
 punctured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her. "I shall be late,
 and then I s'll catch it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up the bicycle,
 and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl of water and stood
 close to him, watching. She loved to see his hands doing things. He was
 slim and vigorous, with a kind of easiness even in his most hasty
 movements. And busy at his work he seemed to forget her. She loved him
 absorbedly. She wanted to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted
 to embrace him, so long as he did not want her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There!" he said, rising suddenly. "Now, could you have done it quicker?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" she laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She put her two hands
 on his sides, and ran them quickly down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are so FINE!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave of flame by
 her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this. He might have been
 an object. She never realised the male he was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn floor to see
 that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's all right!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you have them mended?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why didn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The back one goes on a bit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's not safe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can use my toe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't worry?come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do?about four. I'll come to meet you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate. Looking
 across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the kitchen the heads of
 Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow. It looked very cosy. The road, with
 pine trees, was quite black in front.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Till tomorrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a moment watching
 the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground. She turned
 very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood, his dog
 twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the world was full of
 darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattle in their stalls.
 She prayed earnestly for his safety that night. When he left her, she
 often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had got home safely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy, so he had
 to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged over the second,
 steeper drop in the hill. "Here goes!" he said. It was risky, because of
 the curve in the darkness at the bottom, and because of the brewers'
 waggons with drunken waggoners asleep. His bicycle seemed to fall beneath
 him, and he loved it. Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman.
 He feels he is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself to deprive
 her altogether.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers, silver upon the
 blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the long climb home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves on to the
 table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again. She sat reading,
 alone, as she always did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't they pretty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't mind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still she did not answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know whether I mind or not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then why do you begrudge them tea?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I begrudge whom tea?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you so horrid for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient. She'll
 come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merely Miriam she
 objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was glad to see them
 coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock. Everywhere was clean and
 still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel sat in her black dress and black
 apron. She rose to meet the visitors. With Edgar she was cordial, but with
 Miriam cold and rather grudging. Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice
 in her brown cashmere frock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would have gladly
 proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home. There was
 about it now, he thought, a certain distinction. The chairs were only
 wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrug and cushions were cosy;
 the pictures were prints in good taste; there was a simplicity in
 everything, and plenty of books. He was never ashamed in the least of his
 home, nor was Miriam of hers, because both were what they should be, and
 warm. And then he was proud of the table; the china was pretty, the cloth
 was fine. It did not matter that the spoons were not silver nor the knives
 ivory-handled; everything looked nice. Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully
 while her children were growing up, so that nothing was out of place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic. But Mrs. Morel
 was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew. Morel never
 went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel, like a little
 champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other end; and at first
 Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like home. It was a pretty
 place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars, and flowers. And the same
 people had sat in the same places ever since he was a boy. It was
 wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit there for an hour and a half, next
 to Miriam, and near to his mother, uniting his two loves under the spell
 of the place of worship. Then he felt warm and happy and religious at
 once. And after chapel he walked home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent
 the rest of the evening with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenly
 alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam. He never went
 past the pits at night, by the lighted lamp-house, the tall black
 headstocks and lines of trucks, past the fans spinning slowly like
 shadows, without the feeling of Miriam returning to him, keen and almost
 unbearable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father took one for
 themselves once more. It was under the little gallery, opposite the
 Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapel the Leivers's pew was
 always empty. He was anxious for fear she would not come: it was so far,
 and there were so many rainy Sundays. Then, often very late indeed, she
 came in, with her long stride, her head bowed, her face hidden under her
 bat of dark green velvet. Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in
 shadow. But it gave him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred
 within him, to see her there. It was not the same glow, happiness, and
 pride, that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more
 wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain, as if there were
 something he could not get to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed. He was
 twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginning to dread the spring: he
 became so wild, and hurt her so much. All the way he went cruelly smashing
 her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it. He was by nature critical and rather
 dispassionate. But Miriam suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect
 like a knife, the man she loved examined her religion in which she lived
 and moved and had her being. But he did not spare her. He was cruel. And
 when they went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill her
 soul. He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She exults?she exults as she carries him off from me," Mrs. Morel
 cried in her heart when Paul had gone. "She's not like an ordinary woman,
 who can leave me my share in him. She wants to absorb him. She wants to
 draw him out and absorb him till there is nothing left of him, even for
 himself. He will never be a man on his own feet?she will suck him
 up." So the mother sat, and battled and brooded bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild with torture. He
 walked biting his lips and with clenched fists, going at a great rate.
 Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for some minutes, and did not
 move. There was a great hollow of darkness fronting him, and on the black
 upslopes patches of tiny lights, and in the lowest trough of the night, a
 flare of the pit. It was all weird and dreadful. Why was he torn so,
 almost bewildered, and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and
 suffer? He knew she suffered badly. But why should she? And why did he
 hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother.
 If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he hated her?and he
 easily hated her. Why did she make him feel as if he were uncertain of
 himself, insecure, an indefinite thing, as if he had not sufficient
 sheathing to prevent the night and the space breaking into him? How he
 hated her! And then, what a rush of tenderness and humility!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mother saw on him the
 marks of some agony, and she said nothing. But he had to make her talk to
 him. Then she was angry with him for going so far with Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously. "I'm sure I've tried to
 like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't?I can't!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intense and cruel. So he
 decided to stay away from her. Then came the hours when he knew Miriam was
 expecting him. His mother watched him growing restless. He could not go on
 with his work. He could do nothing. It was as if something were drawing
 his soul out towards Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying
 nothing. And his mother knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the way
 he sighed with relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriam sitting
 beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day. Big clouds, so
 brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole along on the water. The
 clear spaces in the sky were of clean, cold blue. Paul lay on his back in
 the old grass, looking up. He could not bear to look at Miriam. She seemed
 to want him, and he resisted. He resisted all the time. He wanted now to
 give her passion and tenderness, and he could not. He felt that she wanted
 the soul out of his body, and not him. All his strength and energy she
 drew into herself through some channel which united them. She did not want
 to meet him, so that there were two of them, man and woman together. She
 wanted to draw all of him into her. It urged him to an intensity like
 madness, which fascinated him, as drug-taking might.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she were fingering
 the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life, as she heard him.
 It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the end it frightened her. There
 he lay in the white intensity of his search, and his voice gradually
 filled her with fear, so level it was, almost inhuman, as if in a trance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand on his
 forehead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body was somewhere
 discarded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not? Are you tired?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and it wears you out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laughed shortly, realising.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet you always make me like it," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't wish to," she said, very low.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it. But your
 unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose I want it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went on, in his dead fashion:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel off for you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I!" she cried bitterly?"I! Why, when would you let me take you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together, he got up
 and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial. In a vague way he
 hated her for it. And he knew he was as much to blame himself. This,
 however, did not prevent his hating her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening about this time he had walked along the home road with her.
 They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood, unable to part. As the
 stars came out the clouds closed. They had glimpses of their own
 constellation, Orion, towards the west. His jewels glimmered for a moment,
 his dog ran low, struggling with difficulty through the spume of cloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations. They
 had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling, until they
 seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars. This evening Paul had
 been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed just an ordinary constellation
 to him. He had fought against his glamour and fascination. Miriam was
 watching her lover's mood carefully. But he said nothing that gave him
 away, till the moment came to part, when he stood frowning gloomily at the
 gathered clouds, behind which the great constellation must be striding
 still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was to be a little party at his house the next day, at which she was
 to attend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shan't come and meet you," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not that?only they don't like me to. They say I care more for
 you than for them. And you understand, don't you? You know it's only
 friendship."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him an effort. She
 left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation. A fine rain blew
 in her face as she walked along the road. She was hurt deep down; and she
 despised him for being blown about by any wind of authority. And in her
 heart of hearts, unconsciously, she felt that he was trying to get away
 from her. This she would never have acknowledged. She pitied him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse. Mr.
 Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paul remained with
 Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages were to be raised to thirty
 shillings at the year-end, if things went well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson. Paul
 did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved at the thought of
 her education's coming to end; moreover, they both loved to be together,
 in spite of discords. So they read Balzac, and did compositions, and felt
 highly cultured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Friday night was reckoning night for the miners. Morel "reckoned"?shared
 up the money of the stall?either in the New Inn at Bretty or in his
 own house, according as his fellow-butties wished. Barker had turned a
 non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again. She was still a
 tomboy; and she was engaged to be married. Paul was studying design.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the week's
 earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner, prepared to
 get washed. It was decorum for the women to absent themselves while the
 men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spy into such a masculine privacy
 as the butties' reckoning, nor were they to know the exact amount of the
 week's earnings. So, whilst her father was spluttering in the scullery,
 Annie went out to spend an hour with a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to
 her baking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e thy jaw rattle,"
 he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. Paul and the mother frowned
 to hear him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy water
 dripping from him, dithering with cold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my sirs!" he said. "Wheer's my towel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he would have
 bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels before the hot baking-fire
 to dry himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel. "It's NOT cold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery," said
 the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi' thy nesh sides."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul, curious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father. "But there's that
 much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through your ribs like through a
 five-barred gate."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me!" he exclaimed. "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit. My bones fair juts out
 on me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like to know where," retorted his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body, muscular,
 without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear. It might have been the
 body of a man of twenty-eight, except that there were, perhaps, too many
 blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the coal-dust remained under the
 skin, and that his chest was too hairy. But he put his hand on his side
 ruefully. It was his fixed belief that, because he did not get fat, he was
 as thin as a starved rat. Paul looked at his father's thick, brownish
 hands all scarred, with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his
 sides, and the incongruity struck him. It seemed strange they were the
 same flesh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid, like a
 child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself up as if he
 was trying to get in the smallest space he could."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me!" exclaimed Morel?"me a good figure! I wor niver much more n'r a
 skeleton."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Strewth!" he said. "Tha's niver knowed me but what I looked as if I wor
 goin' off in a rapid decline."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat and laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never a man had a
 better start, if it was body that counted. You should have seen him as a
 young man," she cried suddenly to Paul, drawing herself up to imitate her
 husband's once handsome bearing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion she had had for him. It
 blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy, rather scared, and humble. Yet
 again he felt his old glow. And then immediately he felt the ruin he had
 made during these years. He wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it on his shoulders. He
 gave a jump.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried. "Cowd as death!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed, washing his back. It
 was very rarely she would do anything so personal for him. The children
 did those things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion, and went
 upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers. When he was
 dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny, with hair on
 end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his pit-trousers, he stood
 warming the garments he was going to put on. He turned them, he pulled
 them inside out, he scorched them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd as a tub o' water?"
 he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black. He did all
 this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annie and her familiar
 friends had been present.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the red earthenware
 panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took another handful of
 paste, worked it to the proper shape, and dropped it into a tin. As she
 was doing so Barker knocked and entered. He was a quiet, compact little
 man, who looked as if he would go through a stone wall. His black hair was
 cropped short, his head was bony. Like most miners, he was pale, but
 healthy and taut.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated himself with a
 sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-evening," she replied cordially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I dunno as I have," said Barker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen, effacing himself rather.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's missis?" she asked of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had told her some time back:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're expectin' us third just now, you see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty middlin', I
 think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's see?when?" asked Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! And she's kept fairly?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, tidy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. An' I've done another silly trick."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm come be-out th' market-bag."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can have mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shan't. I take a string bag always."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's groceries and
 meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him. "Barker's little, but he's
 ten times the man you are," she said to her husband.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking, with a boyish
 ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile, despite his seven children.
 But his wife was a passionate woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Barker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler. His nose was
 pointed and red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a bit nippy," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then come to the fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, I s'll do where I am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to come on to the
 hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go thy ways i' th' armchair," cried Morel cheerily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly. It was
 too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully happy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. "Did you have that
 flannel singlet made?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not yet," he smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, why didn't you?" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'll come," he smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then, they were both
 as hard as nails, physically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Count it, boy," he asked humbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the bag upside
 down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver, sovereigns and
 loose money. He counted quickly, referred to the checks?the written
 papers giving amount of coal?put the money in order. Then Barker
 glanced at the checks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table. Morel, as
 master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his back to the hot fire.
 The two butties had cooler seats. None of them counted the money.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties cavilled for
 a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the amount was put aside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' Bill Naylor's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This money also was taken from the pack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses, and his rent
 had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each. And because
 Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped, Barker and Wesson
 took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing. Morel gave each of
 them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns; each half a crown
 till there were no more half-crowns; each a shilling till there were no
 more shillings. If there was anything at the end that wouldn't split,
 Morel took it and stood drinks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the house before
 his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended. She looked
 hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing on the table, she saw her
 money lying. Paul had been working all the time. But now he felt his
 mother counting the week's money, and her wrath rising,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He frowned. He could not work when she was cross. She counted again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed. "How much was the
 cheque?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably. He dreaded what was coming.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his club this week! But I
 know him. He thinks because YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any
 longer. No, all he has to do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show
 him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't carry on again. I can't work."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went very quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think I'm going to
 manage?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put up with."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to hell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly. When she
 was fretted he could not bear it. But now he began to insist on her
 recognizing him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done in twenty minutes.
 Don't forget them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," he answered; and she went to market.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentration became
 unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-past seven came a
 low knock, and Miriam entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All alone?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat, hanging
 them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house, his and
 hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It irritated him that she peered so into everything that was his,
 searching him out. He went into the parlour and returned with a bundle of
 brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it, he spread it on the floor. It
 proved to be a curtain or portiere, beautifully stencilled with a design
 on roses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, how beautiful!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The spread cloth, with its wonderful reddish roses and dark green stems,
 all so simple, and somehow so wicked-looking, lay at her feet. She went on
 her knees before it, her dark curls dropping. He saw her crouched
 voluptuously before his work, and his heart beat quickly. Suddenly she
 looked up at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why does it seem cruel?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There seems a feeling of cruelty about it," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's jolly good, whether or not," he replied, folding up his work with a
 lover's hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose slowly, pondering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what will you do with it?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Send it to Liberty's. I did it for my mother, but I think she'd rather
 have the money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Miriam. He had spoken with a touch of bitterness, and Miriam
 sympathised. Money would have been nothing to HER.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the cloth back into the parlour. When he returned he threw to
 Miriam a smaller piece. It was a cushion-cover with the same design.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did that for you," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She fingered the work with trembling hands, and did not speak. He became
 embarrassed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By Jove, the bread!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the top loaves out, tapped them vigorously. They were done. He put
 them on the hearth to cool. Then he went to the scullery, wetted his
 hands, scooped the last white dough out of the punchion, and dropped it in
 a baking-tin. Miriam was still bent over her painted cloth. He stood
 rubbing the bits of dough from his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do like it?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked up at him, with her dark eyes one flame of love. He laughed
 uncomfortably. Then he began to talk about the design. There was for him
 the most intense pleasure in talking about his work to Miriam. All his
 passion, all his wild blood, went into this intercourse with her, when he
 talked and conceived his work. She brought forth to him his imaginations.
 She did not understand, any more than a woman understands when she
 conceives a child in her womb. But this was life for her and for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While they were talking, a young woman of about twenty-two, small and
 pale, hollow-eyed, yet with a relentless look about her, entered the room.
 She was a friend at the Morel's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take your things off," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I'm not stopping."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down in the armchair opposite Paul and Miriam, who were on the
 sofa. Miriam moved a little farther from him. The room was hot, with a
 scent of new bread. Brown, crisp loaves stood on the hearth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't have expected to see you here to-night, Miriam Leivers," said
 Beatrice wickedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?" murmured Miriam huskily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, let's look at your shoes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam remained uncomfortably still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If tha doesna tha durs'na," laughed Beatrice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam put her feet from under her dress. Her boots had that queer,
 irresolute, rather pathetic look about them, which showed how
 self-conscious and self-mistrustful she was. And they were covered with
 mud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Glory! You're a positive muck-heap," exclaimed Beatrice. "Who cleans your
 boots?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I clean them myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you wanted a job," said Beatrice. "It would ha' taken a lot of men
 to ha' brought me down here to-night. But love laughs at sludge, doesn't
 it, 'Postle my duck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Inter alia," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Lord! are you going to spout foreign languages? What does it mean,
 Miriam?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a fine sarcasm in the last question, but Miriam did not see it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Among other things,' I believe," she said humbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Beatrice put her tongue between her teeth and laughed wickedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Among other things,' 'Postle?" she repeated. "Do you mean love laughs at
 mothers, and fathers, and sisters, and brothers, and men friends, and lady
 friends, and even at the b'loved himself?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She affected a great innocence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In fact, it's one big smile," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Up its sleeve, 'Postle Morel?you believe me," she said; and she
 went off into another burst of wicked, silent laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam sat silent, withdrawn into herself. Every one of Paul's friends
 delighted in taking sides against her, and he left her in the lurch?seemed
 almost to have a sort of revenge upon her then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you still at school?" asked Miriam of Beatrice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've not had your notice, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I expect it at Easter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it an awful shame, to turn you off merely because you didn't pass
 the exam?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," said Beatrice coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Agatha says you're as good as any teacher anywhere. It seems to me
 ridiculous. I wonder why you didn't pass."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Short of brains, eh, 'Postle?" said Beatrice briefly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only brains to bite with," replied Paul, laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nuisance!" she cried; and, springing from her seat, she rushed and boxed
 his ears. She had beautiful small hands. He held her wrists while she
 wrestled with him. At last she broke free, and seized two handfuls of his
 thick, dark brown hair, which she shook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Beat!" he said, as he pulled his hair straight with his fingers. "I hate
 you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed with glee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mind!" she said. "I want to sit next to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd as lief be neighbours with a vixen," he said, nevertheless making
 place for her between him and Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did it ruffle his pretty hair, then!" she cried; and, with her hair-comb,
 she combed him straight. "And his nice little moustache!" she exclaimed.
 She tilted his head back and combed his young moustache. "It's a wicked
 moustache, 'Postle," she said. "It's a red for danger. Have you got any of
 those cigarettes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pulled his cigarette-case from his pocket. Beatrice looked inside it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And fancy me having Connie's last cig.," said Beatrice, putting the thing
 between her teeth. He held a lit match to her, and she puffed daintily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thanks so much, darling," she said mockingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It gave her a wicked delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you think he does it nicely, Miriam?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very!" said Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a cigarette for himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Light, old boy?" said Beatrice, tilting her cigarette at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He bent forward to her to light his cigarette at hers. She was winking at
 him as he did so. Miriam saw his eyes trembling with mischief, and his
 full, almost sensual, mouth quivering. He was not himself, and she could
 not bear it. As he was now, she had no connection with him; she might as
 well not have existed. She saw the cigarette dancing on his full red lips.
 She hated his thick hair for being tumbled loose on his forehead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sweet boy!" said Beatrice, tipping up his chin and giving him a little
 kiss on the cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I s'll kiss thee back, Beat," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha wunna!" she giggled, jumping up and going away. "Isn't he shameless,
 Miriam?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite," said Miriam. "By the way, aren't you forgetting the bread?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By Jove!" he cried, flinging open the oven door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Out puffed the bluish smoke and a smell of burned bread.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, golly!" cried Beatrice, coming to his side. He crouched before the
 oven, she peered over his shoulder. "This is what comes of the oblivion of
 love, my boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was ruefully removing the loaves. One was burnt black on the hot
 side; another was hard as a brick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor mater!" said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You want to grate it," said Beatrice. "Fetch me the nutmeg-grater."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She arranged the bread in the oven. He brought the grater, and she grated
 the bread on to a newspaper on the table. He set the doors open to blow
 away the smell of burned bread. Beatrice grated away, puffing her
 cigarette, knocking the charcoal off the poor loaf.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word, Miriam! you're in for it this time," said Beatrice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I!" exclaimed Miriam in amazement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd better be gone when his mother comes in. I know why King Alfred
 burned the cakes. Now I see it! 'Postle would fix up a tale about his work
 making him forget, if he thought it would wash. If that old woman had come
 in a bit sooner, she'd have boxed the brazen thing's ears who made the
 oblivion, instead of poor Alfred's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She giggled as she scraped the loaf. Even Miriam laughed in spite of
 herself. Paul mended the fire ruefully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The garden gate was heard to bang.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick!" cried Beatrice, giving Paul the scraped loaf. "Wrap it up in a
 damp towel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul disappeared into the scullery. Beatrice hastily blew her scrapings
 into the fire, and sat down innocently. Annie came bursting in. She was an
 abrupt, quite smart young woman. She blinked in the strong light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Smell of burning!" she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the cigarettes," replied Beatrice demurely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's Paul?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leonard had followed Annie. He had a long comic face and blue eyes, very
 sad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose he's left you to settle it between you," he said. He nodded
 sympathetically to Miriam, and became gently sarcastic to Beatrice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said Beatrice, "he's gone off with number nine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I just met number five inquiring for him," said Leonard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?we're going to share him up like Solomon's baby," said
 Beatrice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, ay," said Leonard. "And which bit should you have?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," said Beatrice. "I'll let all the others pick first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' you'd have the leavings, like?" said Leonard, twisting up a comic
 face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie was looking in the oven. Miriam sat ignored. Paul entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This bread's a fine sight, our Paul," said Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you should stop an' look after it," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean YOU should do what you're reckoning to do," replied Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He should, shouldn't he!" cried Beatrice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I s'd think he'd got plenty on hand," said Leonard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You had a nasty walk, didn't you, Miriam?" said Annie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?but I'd been in all week?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you wanted a bit of a change, like," insinuated Leonard kindly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you can't be stuck in the house for ever," Annie agreed. She was
 quite amiable. Beatrice pulled on her coat, and went out with Leonard and
 Annie. She would meet her own boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't forget that bread, our Paul," cried Annie. "Good-night, Miriam. I
 don't think it will rain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they had all gone, Paul fetched the swathed loaf, unwrapped it, and
 surveyed it sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a mess!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," answered Miriam impatiently, "what is it, after all?twopence,
 ha'penny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but?it's the mater's precious baking, and she'll take it to
 heart. However, it's no good bothering."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the loaf back into the scullery. There was a little distance
 between him and Miriam. He stood balanced opposite her for some moments
 considering, thinking of his behaviour with Beatrice. He felt guilty
 inside himself, and yet glad. For some inscrutable reason it served Miriam
 right. He was not going to repent. She wondered what he was thinking of as
 he stood suspended. His thick hair was tumbled over his forehead. Why
 might she not push it back for him, and remove the marks of Beatrice's
 comb? Why might she not press his body with her two hands. It looked so
 firm, and every whit living. And he would let other girls, why not her?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly he started into life. It made her quiver almost with terror as he
 quickly pushed the hair off his forehead and came towards her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Half-past eight!" he said. "We'd better buck up. Where's your French?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam shyly and rather bitterly produced her exercise-book. Every week
 she wrote for him a sort of diary of her inner life, in her own French. He
 had found this was the only way to get her to do compositions. And her
 diary was mostly a love-letter. He would read it now; she felt as if her
 soul's history were going to be desecrated by him in his present mood. He
 sat beside her. She watched his hand, firm and warm, rigorously scoring
 her work. He was reading only the French, ignoring her soul that was
 there. But gradually his hand forgot its work. He read in silence,
 motionless. She quivered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'<i>Ce matin les oiseaux m'ont eveille,'" he read. "'Il faisait encore un
 crepuscule. Mais la petite fenetre de ma chambre etait bleme, et puis,
 jaune, et tous les oiseaux du bois eclaterent dans un chanson vif et
 resonnant. Toute l'aube tressaillit. J'avais reve de vous. Est-ce que vous
 voyez aussi l'aube? Les oiseaux m'eveillent presque tous les matins, et
 toujours il y a quelque chose de terreur dans le cri des grives. Il est si
 clair</i>?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam sat tremulous, half ashamed. He remained quite still, trying to
 understand. He only knew she loved him. He was afraid of her love for him.
 It was too good for him, and he was inadequate. His own love was at fault,
 not hers. Ashamed, he corrected her work, humbly writing above her words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look," he said quietly, "the past participle conjugated with <i>avoir</i>
 agrees with the direct object when it precedes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She bent forward, trying to see and to understand. Her free, fine curls
 tickled his face. He started as if they had been red hot, shuddering. He
 saw her peering forward at the page, her red lips parted piteously, the
 black hair springing in fine strands across her tawny, ruddy cheek. She
 was coloured like a pomegranate for richness. His breath came short as he
 watched her. Suddenly she looked up at him. Her dark eyes were naked with
 their love, afraid, and yearning. His eyes, too, were dark, and they hurt
 her. They seemed to master her. She lost all her self-control, was exposed
 in fear. And he knew, before he could kiss her, he must drive something
 out of himself. And a touch of hate for her crept back again into his
 heart. He returned to her exercise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly he flung down the pencil, and was at the oven in a leap, turning
 the bread. For Miriam he was too quick. She started violently, and it hurt
 her with real pain. Even the way he crouched before the oven hurt her.
 There seemed to be something cruel in it, something cruel in the swift way
 he pitched the bread out of the tins, caught it up again. If only he had
 been gentle in his movements she would have felt so rich and warm. As it
 was, she was hurt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He returned and finished the exercise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've done well this week," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She saw he was flattered by her diary. It did not repay her entirely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You really do blossom out sometimes," he said. "You ought to write
 poetry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She lifted her head with joy, then she shook it mistrustfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't trust myself," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You should try!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again she shook her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall we read, or is it too late?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is late?but we can read just a little," she pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was really getting now the food for her life during the next week. He
 made her copy Baudelaire's "Le Balcon". Then he read it for her. His voice
 was soft and caressing, but growing almost brutal. He had a way of lifting
 his lips and showing his teeth, passionately and bitterly, when he was
 much moved. This he did now. It made Miriam feel as if he were trampling
 on her. She dared not look at him, but sat with her head bowed. She could
 not understand why he got into such a tumult and fury. It made her
 wretched. She did not like Baudelaire, on the whole?nor Verlaine.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Behold her singing in the field
 Yon solitary highland lass."
</pre>
 <p>
 That nourished her heart. So did "Fair Ines". And?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "It was a beauteous evening, calm and pure,
 And breathing holy quiet like a nun."
</pre>
 <p>
 These were like herself. And there was he, saying in his throat bitterly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Tu te rappelleras la beaute des caresses</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poem was finished; he took the bread out of the oven, arranging the
 burnt loaves at the bottom of the panchion, the good ones at the top. The
 desiccated loaf remained swathed up in the scullery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mater needn't know till morning," he said. "It won't upset her so much
 then as at night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam looked in the bookcase, saw what postcards and letters he had
 received, saw what books were there. She took one that had interested him.
 Then he turned down the gas and they set off. He did not trouble to lock
 the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was not home again until a quarter to eleven. His mother was seated in
 the rocking-chair. Annie, with a rope of hair hanging down her back,
 remained sitting on a low stool before the fire, her elbows on her knees,
 gloomily. On the table stood the offending loaf unswathed. Paul entered
 rather breathless. No one spoke. His mother was reading the little local
 newspaper. He took off his coat, and went to sit down on the sofa. His
 mother moved curtly aside to let him pass. No one spoke. He was very
 uncomfortable. For some minutes he sat pretending to read a piece of paper
 he found on the table. Then?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I forgot that bread, mother," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no answer from either woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "it's only twopence ha'penny. I can pay you for that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Being angry, he put three pennies on the table and slid them towards his
 mother. She turned away her head. Her mouth was shut tightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Annie, "you don't know how badly my mother is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl sat staring glumly into the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why is she badly?" asked Paul, in his overbearing way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said Annie. "She could scarcely get home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked closely at his mother. She looked ill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "WHY could you scarcely get home?" he asked her, still sharply. She would
 not answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I found her as white as a sheet sitting here," said Annie, with a
 suggestion of tears in her voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, WHY?" insisted Paul. His brows were knitting, his eyes dilating
 passionately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was enough to upset anybody," said Mrs. Morel, "hugging those parcels?meat,
 and green-groceries, and a pair of curtains?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, why DID you hug them; you needn't have done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then who would?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let Annie fetch the meat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and I WOULD fetch the meat, but how was I to know. You were off with
 Miriam, instead of being in when my mother came."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what was the matter with you?" asked Paul of his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose it's my heart," she replied. Certainly she looked bluish round
 the mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And have you felt it before?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?often enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then why haven't you told me??and why haven't you seen a doctor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel shifted in her chair, angry with him for his hectoring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd never notice anything," said Annie. "You're too eager to be off
 with Miriam."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, am I?and any worse than you with Leonard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was in at a quarter to ten."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was silence in the room for a time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should have thought," said Mrs. Morel bitterly, "that she wouldn't have
 occupied you so entirely as to burn a whole ovenful of bread."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Beatrice was here as well as she."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very likely. But we know why the bread is spoilt."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" he flashed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because you were engrossed with Miriam," replied Mrs. Morel hotly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well?then it was NOT!" he replied angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was distressed and wretched. Seizing a paper, he began to read. Annie,
 her blouse unfastened, her long ropes of hair twisted into a plait, went
 up to bed, bidding him a very curt good-night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul sat pretending to read. He knew his mother wanted to upbraid him. He
 also wanted to know what had made her ill, for he was troubled. So,
 instead of running away to bed, as he would have liked to do, he sat and
 waited. There was a tense silence. The clock ticked loudly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd better go to bed before your father comes in," said the mother
 harshly. "And if you're going to have anything to eat, you'd better get
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want anything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was his mother's custom to bring him some trifle for supper on Friday
 night, the night of luxury for the colliers. He was too angry to go and
 find it in the pantry this night. This insulted her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I WANTED you to go to Selby on Friday night, I can imagine the scene,"
 said Mrs. Morel. "But you're never too tired to go if SHE will come for
 you. Nay, you neither want to eat nor drink then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't let her go alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't you? And why does she come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not because I ask her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She doesn't come without you want her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what if I DO want her?" he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, nothing, if it was sensible or reasonable. But to go trapseing up
 there miles and miles in the mud, coming home at midnight, and got to go
 to Nottingham in the morning?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I hadn't, you'd be just the same."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I should, because there's no sense in it. Is she so fascinating that
 you must follow her all that way?" Mrs. Morel was bitterly sarcastic. She
 sat still, with averted face, stroking with a rhythmic, jerked movement,
 the black sateen of her apron. It was a movement that hurt Paul to see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do like her," he said, "but?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "LIKE her!" said Mrs. Morel, in the same biting tones. "It seems to me you
 like nothing and nobody else. There's neither Annie, nor me, nor anyone
 now for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What nonsense, mother?you know I don't love her?I?I
 tell you I DON'T love her?she doesn't even walk with my arm, because
 I don't want her to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then why do you fly to her so often?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I DO like to talk to her?I never said I didn't. But I DON'T love
 her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there nobody else to talk to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not about the things we talk of. There's a lot of things that you're not
 interested in, that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What things?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel was so intense that Paul began to pant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?painting?and books. YOU don't care about Herbert
 Spencer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," was the sad reply. "And YOU won't at my age."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, but I do now?and Miriam does?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how do you know," Mrs. Morel flashed defiantly, "that I shouldn't. Do
 you ever try me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you don't, mother, you know you don't care whether a picture's
 decorative or not; you don't care what MANNER it is in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you know I don't care? Do you ever try me? Do you ever talk to me
 about these things, to try?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's not that that matters to you, mother, you know t's not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it, then?what is it, then, that matters to me?" she
 flashed. He knitted his brows with pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're old, mother, and we're young."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He only meant that the interests of HER age were not the interests of his.
 But he realised the moment he had spoken that he had said the wrong thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I know it well?I am old. And therefore I may stand aside; I
 have nothing more to do with you. You only want me to wait on you?the
 rest is for Miriam."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He could not bear it. Instinctively he realised that he was life to her.
 And, after all, she was the chief thing to him, the only supreme thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know it isn't, mother, you know it isn't!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was moved to pity by his cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It looks a great deal like it," she said, half putting aside her despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, mother?I really DON'T love her. I talk to her, but I want to
 come home to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had taken off his collar and tie, and rose, bare-throated, to go to
 bed. As he stooped to kiss his mother, she threw her arms round his neck,
 hid her face on his shoulder, and cried, in a whimpering voice, so unlike
 her own that he writhed in agony:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't bear it. I could let another woman?but not her. She'd leave
 me no room, not a bit of room?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And immediately he hated Miriam bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I've never?you know, Paul?I've never had a husband?not
 really?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she exults so in taking you from me?she's not like ordinary
 girls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't love her, mother," he murmured, bowing his head and hiding
 his eyes on her shoulder in misery. His mother kissed him a long, fervent
 kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My boy!" she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There," said his mother, "now go to bed. You'll be so tired in the
 morning." As she was speaking she heard her husband coming. "There's your
 father?now go." Suddenly she looked at him almost as if in fear.
 "Perhaps I'm selfish. If you want her, take her, my boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother looked so strange, Paul kissed her, trembling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha?mother!" he said softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel came in, walking unevenly. His hat was over one corner of his eye.
 He balanced in the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At your mischief again?" he said venomously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel's emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkard who had come
 in thus upon her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At any rate, it is sober," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm?h'm! h'm?h'm!" he sneered. He went into the passage, hung
 up his hat and coat. Then they heard him go down three steps to the
 pantry. He returned with a piece of pork-pie in his fist. It was what Mrs.
 Morel had bought for her son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor was that bought for you. If you can give me no more than twenty-five
 shillings, I'm sure I'm not going to buy you pork-pie to stuff, after
 you've swilled a bellyful of beer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wha-at?wha-at!" snarled Morel, toppling in his balance. "Wha-at?not
 for me?" He looked at the piece of meat and crust, and suddenly, in a
 vicious spurt of temper, flung it into the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul started to his feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Waste your own stuff!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?what!" suddenly shouted Morel, jumping up and clenching his
 fist. "I'll show yer, yer young jockey!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right!" said Paul viciously, putting his head on one side. "Show me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smack at something.
 Morel was half crouching, fists up, ready to spring. The young man stood,
 smiling with his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ussha!" hissed the father, swiping round with a great stroke just past
 his son's face. He dared not, even though so close, really touch the young
 man, but swerved an inch away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Right!" said Paul, his eyes upon the side of his father's mouth, where in
 another instant his fist would have hit. He ached for that stroke. But he
 heard a faint moan from behind. His mother was deadly pale and dark at the
 mouth. Morel was dancing up to deliver another blow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Father!" said Paul, so that the word rang.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel started, and stood at attention.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother!" moaned the boy. "Mother!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She began to struggle with herself. Her open eyes watched him, although
 she could not move. Gradually she was coming to herself. He laid her down
 on the sofa, and ran upstairs for a little whisky, which at last she could
 sip. The tears were hopping down his face. As he kneeled in front of her
 he did not cry, but the tears ran down his face quickly. Morel, on the
 opposite side of the room, sat with his elbows on his knees glaring
 across.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's a-matter with 'er?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Faint!" replied Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elderly man began to unlace his boots. He stumbled off to bed. His
 last fight was fought in that home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul kneeled there, stroking his mother's hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be poorly, mother?don't be poorly!" he said time after time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's nothing, my boy," she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last he rose, fetched in a large piece of coal, and raked the fire.
 Then he cleared the room, put everything straight, laid the things for
 breakfast, and brought his mother's candle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you go to bed, mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I'll come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sleep with Annie, mother, not with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I'll sleep in my own bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't sleep with him, mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll sleep in my own bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose, and he turned out the gas, then followed her closely upstairs,
 carrying her candle. On the landing he kissed her close.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night, mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pressed his face upon the pillow in a fury of misery. And yet,
 somewhere in his soul, he was at peace because he still loved his mother
 best. It was the bitter peace of resignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The efforts of his father to conciliate him next day were a great
 humiliation to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody tried to forget the scene.

 CHAPTER IX
 </h2>
 <h3>
 DEFEAT OF MIRIAM
 </h3>
 <p>
 PAUL was dissatisfied with himself and with everything. The deepest of his
 love belonged to his mother. When he felt he had hurt her, or wounded his
 love for her, he could not bear it. Now it was spring, and there was
 battle between him and Miriam. This year he had a good deal against her.
 She was vaguely aware of it. The old feeling that she was to be a
 sacrifice to this love, which she had had when she prayed, was mingled in
 all her emotions. She did not at the bottom believe she ever would have
 him. She did not believe in herself primarily: doubted whether she could
 ever be what he would demand of her. Certainly she never saw herself
 living happily through a lifetime with him. She saw tragedy, sorrow, and
 sacrifice ahead. And in sacrifice she was proud, in renunciation she was
 strong, for she did not trust herself to support everyday life. She was
 prepared for the big things and the deep things, like tragedy. It was the
 sufficiency of the small day-life she could not trust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Easter holidays began happily. Paul was his own frank self. Yet she
 felt it would go wrong. On the Sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom
 window, looking across at the oak-trees of the wood, in whose branches a
 twilight was tangled, below the bright sky of the afternoon. Grey-green
 rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window, some already, she
 fancied, showing bud. It was spring, which she loved and dreaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense. It was a bright grey
 day. Paul came into the yard with his bicycle, which glittered as he
 walked. Usually he rang his bell and laughed towards the house. To-day he
 walked with shut lips and cold, cruel bearing, that had something of a
 slouch and a sneer in it. She knew him well by now, and could tell from
 that keen-looking, aloof young body of his what was happening inside him.
 There was a cold correctness in the way he put his bicycle in its place,
 that made her heart sink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came downstairs nervously. She was wearing a new net blouse that she
 thought became her. It had a high collar with a tiny ruff, reminding her
 of Mary, Queen of Scots, and making her, she thought, look wonderfully a
 woman, and dignified. At twenty she was full-breasted and luxuriously
 formed. Her face was still like a soft rich mask, unchangeable. But her
 eyes, once lifted, were wonderful. She was afraid of him. He would notice
 her new blouse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He, being in a hard, ironical mood, was entertaining the family to a
 description of a service given in the Primitive Methodist Chapel,
 conducted by one of the well-known preachers of the sect. He sat at the
 head of the table, his mobile face, with the eyes that could be so
 beautiful, shining with tenderness or dancing with laughter, now taking on
 one expression and then another, in imitation of various people he was
 mocking. His mockery always hurt her; it was too near the reality. He was
 too clever and cruel. She felt that when his eyes were like this, hard
 with mocking hate, he would spare neither himself nor anybody else. But
 Mrs. Leivers was wiping her eyes with laughter, and Mr. Leivers, just
 awake from his Sunday nap, was rubbing his head in amusement. The three
 brothers sat with ruffled, sleepy appearance in their shirt-sleeves,
 giving a guffaw from time to time. The whole family loved a "take-off"
 more than anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took no notice of Miriam. Later, she saw him remark her new blouse, saw
 that the artist approved, but it won from him not a spark of warmth. She
 was nervous, could hardly reach the teacups from the shelves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the men went out to milk, she ventured to address him personally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were late," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was I?" he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was silence for a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was it rough riding?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't notice it." She continued quickly to lay the table. When she had
 finished?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tea won't be for a few minutes. Will you come and look at the daffodils?"
 she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rose without answering. They went out into the back garden under the
 budding damson-trees. The hills and the sky were clean and cold.
 Everything looked washed, rather hard. Miriam glanced at Paul. He was pale
 and impassive. It seemed cruel to her that his eyes and brows, which she
 loved, could look so hurting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has the wind made you tired?" she asked. She detected an underneath
 feeling of weariness about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I think not," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It must be rough on the road?the wood moans so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can see by the clouds it's a south-west wind; that helps me here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see, I don't cycle, so I don't understand," she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there need to cycle to know that!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She thought his sarcasms were unnecessary. They went forward in silence.
 Round the wild, tussocky lawn at the back of the house was a thorn hedge,
 under which daffodils were craning forward from among their sheaves of
 grey-green blades. The cheeks of the flowers were greenish with cold. But
 still some had burst, and their gold ruffled and glowed. Miriam went on
 her knees before one cluster, took a wild-looking daffodil between her
 hands, turned up its face of gold to her, and bowed down, caressing it
 with her mouth and cheeks and brow. He stood aside, with his hands in his
 pockets, watching her. One after another she turned up to him the faces of
 the yellow, bursten flowers appealingly, fondling them lavishly all the
 while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't they magnificent?" she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Magnificent! It's a bit thick?they're pretty!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She bowed again to her flowers at his censure of her praise. He watched
 her crouching, sipping the flowers with fervid kisses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why must you always be fondling things?" he said irritably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I love to touch them," she replied, hurt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you never like things without clutching them as if you wanted to pull
 the heart out of them? Why don't you have a bit more restraint, or
 reserve, or something?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked up at him full of pain, then continued slowly to stroke her
 lips against a ruffled flower. Their scent, as she smelled it, was so much
 kinder than he; it almost made her cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You wheedle the soul out of things," he said. "I would never wheedle?at
 any rate, I'd go straight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He scarcely knew what he was saying. These things came from him
 mechanically. She looked at him. His body seemed one weapon, firm and hard
 against her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're always begging things to love you," he said, "as if you were a
 beggar for love. Even the flowers, you have to fawn on them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rhythmically, Miriam was swaying and stroking the flower with her mouth,
 inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudder as it came to her
 nostrils.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't want to love?your eternal and abnormal craving is to be
 loved. You aren't positive, you're negative. You absorb, absorb, as if you
 must fill yourself up with love, because you've got a shortage somewhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was stunned by his cruelty, and did not hear. He had not the faintest
 notion of what he was saying. It was as if his fretted, tortured soul, run
 hot by thwarted passion, jetted off these sayings like sparks from
 electricity. She did not grasp anything he said. She only sat crouched
 beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her. She never realised in a flash.
 Over everything she brooded and brooded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After tea he stayed with Edgar and the brothers, taking no notice of
 Miriam. She, extremely unhappy on this looked-for holiday, waited for him.
 And at last he yielded and came to her. She was determined to track this
 mood of his to its origin. She counted it not much more than a mood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall we go through the wood a little way?" she asked him, knowing he
 never refused a direct request.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went down to the warren. On the middle path they passed a trap, a
 narrow horseshoe hedge of small fir-boughs, baited with the guts of a
 rabbit. Paul glanced at it frowning. She caught his eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it dreadful?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know! Is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a rabbit's
 throat? One weasel or many rabbits? One or the other must go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was taking the bitterness of life badly. She was rather sorry for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We will go back to the house," he said. "I don't want to walk out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went past the lilac-tree, whose bronze leaf-buds were coming
 unfastened. Just a fragment remained of the haystack, a monument squared
 and brown, like a pillar of stone. There was a little bed of hay from the
 last cutting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us sit here a minute," said Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat down against his will, resting his back against the hard wall of
 hay. They faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowed with sunset,
 tiny white farms standing out, the meadows golden, the woods dark and yet
 luminous, tree-tops folded over tree-tops, distinct in the distance. The
 evening had cleared, and the east was tender with a magenta flush under
 which the land lay still and rich.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it beautiful?" she pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he only scowled. He would rather have had it ugly just then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that moment a big bull-terrier came rushing up, open-mouthed, pranced
 his two paws on the youth's shoulders, licking his face. Paul drew back,
 laughing. Bill was a great relief to him. He pushed the dog aside, but it
 came leaping back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get out," said the lad, "or I'll dot thee one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the dog was not to be pushed away. So Paul had a little battle with
 the creature, pitching poor Bill away from him, who, however, only
 floundered tumultuously back again, wild with joy. The two fought
 together, the man laughing grudgingly, the dog grinning all over. Miriam
 watched them. There was something pathetic about the man. He wanted so
 badly to love, to be tender. The rough way he bowled the dog over was
 really loving. Bill got up, panting with happiness, his brown eyes rolling
 in his white face, and lumbered back again. He adored Paul. The lad
 frowned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bill, I've had enough o' thee," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the dog only stood with two heavy paws, that quivered with love, upon
 his thigh, and flickered a red tongue at him. He drew back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he said?"no?I've had enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in a minute the dog trotted off happily, to vary the fun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He remained staring miserably across at the hills, whose still beauty he
 begrudged. He wanted to go and cycle with Edgar. Yet he had not the
 courage to leave Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why are you sad?" she asked humbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not sad; why should I be," he answered. "I'm only normal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wondered why he always claimed to be normal when he was disagreeable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what is the matter?" she pleaded, coaxing him soothingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay!" she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd far better not talk," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I wish to know?" she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laughed resentfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You always do," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not fair to me," she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He thrust, thrust, thrust at the ground with the pointed stick, digging up
 little clods of earth as if he were in a fever of irritation. She gently
 and firmly laid her band on his wrist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't!" she said. "Put it away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He flung the stick into the currant-bushes, and leaned back. Now he was
 bottled up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" she pleaded softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lay perfectly still, only his eyes alive, and they full of torment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know," he said at length, rather wearily?"you know?we'd
 better break off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was what she dreaded. Swiftly everything seemed to darken before her
 eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why!" she murmured. "What has happened?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing has happened. We only realise where we are. It's no good?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She waited in silence, sadly, patiently. It was no good being impatient
 with him. At any rate, he would tell her now what ailed him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We agreed on friendship," he went on in a dull, monotonous voice. "How
 often HAVE we agreed for friendship! And yet?it neither stops there,
 nor gets anywhere else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was silent again. She brooded. What did he mean? He was so wearying.
 There was something he would not yield. Yet she must be patient with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can only give friendship?it's all I'm capable of?it's a
 flaw in my make-up. The thing overbalances to one side?I hate a
 toppling balance. Let us have done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was warmth of fury in his last phrases. He meant she loved him more
 than he her. Perhaps he could not love her. Perhaps she had not in herself
 that which he wanted. It was the deepest motive of her soul, this
 self-mistrust. It was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge.
 Perhaps she was deficient. Like an infinitely subtle shame, it kept her
 always back. If it were so, she would do without him. She would never let
 herself want him. She would merely see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what has happened?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing?it's all in myself?it only comes out just now. We're
 always like this towards Easter-time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He grovelled so helplessly, she pitied him. At least she never floundered
 in such a pitiable way. After all, it was he who was chiefly humiliated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you want?" she asked him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?I mustn't come often?that's all. Why should I monopolise
 you when I'm not?You see, I'm deficient in something with regard to
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was telling her he did not love her, and so ought to leave her a chance
 with another man. How foolish and blind and shamefully clumsy he was! What
 were other men to her! What were men to her at all! But he, ah! she loved
 his soul. Was HE deficient in something? Perhaps he was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I don't understand," she said huskily. "Yesterday?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The night was turning jangled and hateful to him as the twilight faded.
 And she bowed under her suffering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know," he cried, "you never will! You'll never believe that I can't?can't
 physically, any more than I can fly up like a skylark?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?" she murmured. Now she dreaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Love you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hated her bitterly at that moment because he made her suffer. Love her!
 She knew he loved her. He really belonged to her. This about not loving
 her, physically, bodily, was a mere perversity on his part, because he
 knew she loved him. He was stupid like a child. He belonged to her. His
 soul wanted her. She guessed somebody had been influencing him. She felt
 upon him the hardness, the foreignness of another influence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What have they been saying at home?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not that," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then she knew it was. She despised them for their commonness, his
 people. They did not know what things were really worth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He and she talked very little more that night. After all he left her to
 cycle with Edgar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had come back to his mother. Hers was the strongest tie in his life.
 When he thought round, Miriam shrank away. There was a vague, unreal feel
 about her. And nobody else mattered. There was one place in the world that
 stood solid and did not melt into unreality: the place where his mother
 was. Everybody else could grow shadowy, almost non-existent to him, but
 she could not. It was as if the pivot and pole of his life, from which he
 could not escape, was his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in the same way she waited for him. In him was established her life
 now. After all, the life beyond offered very little to Mrs. Morel. She saw
 that our chance for DOING is here, and doing counted with her. Paul was
 going to prove that she had been right; he was going to make a man whom
 nothing should shift off his feet; he was going to alter the face of the
 earth in some way which mattered. Wherever he went she felt her soul went
 with him. Whatever he did she felt her soul stood by him, ready, as it
 were, to hand him his tools. She could not bear it when he was with
 Miriam. William was dead. She would fight to keep Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he came back to her. And in his soul was a feeling of the satisfaction
 of self-sacrifice because he was faithful to her. She loved him first; he
 loved her first. And yet it was not enough. His new young life, so strong
 and imperious, was urged towards something else. It made him mad with
 restlessness. She saw this, and wished bitterly that Miriam had been a
 woman who could take this new life of his, and leave her the roots. He
 fought against his mother almost as he fought against Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a week before he went again to Willey Farm. Miriam had suffered a
 great deal, and was afraid to see him again. Was she now to endure the
 ignominy of his abandoning her? That would only be superficial and
 temporary. He would come back. She held the keys to his soul. But
 meanwhile, how he would torture her with his battle against her. She
 shrank from it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, the Sunday after Easter he came to tea. Mrs. Leivers was glad to
 see him. She gathered something was fretting him, that he found things
 hard. He seemed to drift to her for comfort. And she was good to him. She
 did him that great kindness of treating him almost with reverence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He met her with the young children in the front garden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm glad you've come," said the mother, looking at him with her great
 appealing brown eyes. "It is such a sunny day. I was just going down the
 fields for the first time this year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He felt she would like him to come. That soothed him. They went, talking
 simply, he gentle and humble. He could have wept with gratitude that she
 was deferential to him. He was feeling humiliated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the bottom of the Mow Close they found a thrush's nest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall I show you the eggs?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do!" replied Mrs. Leivers. "They seem SUCH a sign of spring, and so
 hopeful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He put aside the thorns, and took out the eggs, holding them in the palm
 of his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are quite hot?I think we frightened her off them," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, poor thing!" said Mrs. Leivers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam could not help touching the eggs, and his hand which, it seemed to
 her, cradled them so well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it a strange warmth!" she murmured, to get near him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blood heat," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She watched him putting them back, his body pressed against the hedge, his
 arm reaching slowly through the thorns, his hand folded carefully over the
 eggs. He was concentrated on the act. Seeing him so, she loved him; he
 seemed so simple and sufficient to himself. And she could not get to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After tea she stood hesitating at the bookshelf. He took "Tartarin de
 Tarascon". Again they sat on the bank of hay at the foot of the stack. He
 read a couple of pages, but without any heart for it. Again the dog came
 racing up to repeat the fun of the other day. He shoved his muzzle in the
 man's chest. Paul fingered his ear for a moment. Then he pushed him away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go away, Bill," he said. "I don't want you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bill slunk off, and Miriam wondered and dreaded what was coming. There was
 a silence about the youth that made her still with apprehension. It was
 not his furies, but his quiet resolutions that she feared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Turning his face a little to one side, so that she could not see him, he
 began, speaking slowly and painfully:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think?if I didn't come up so much?you might get to
 like somebody else?another man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So this was what he was still harping on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I don't know any other men. Why do you ask?" she replied, in a low
 tone that should have been a reproach to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," he blurted, "because they say I've no right to come up like this?without
 we mean to marry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was indignant at anybody's forcing the issues between them. She had
 been furious with her own father for suggesting to Paul, laughingly, that
 he knew why he came so much.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who says?" she asked, wondering if her people had anything to do with it.
 They had not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother?and the others. They say at this rate everybody will
 consider me engaged, and I ought to consider myself so, because it's not
 fair to you. And I've tried to find out?and I don't think I love you
 as a man ought to love his wife. What do you think about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam bowed her head moodily. She was angry at having this struggle.
 People should leave him and her alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," she murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think we love each other enough to marry?" he asked definitely. It
 made her tremble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she answered truthfully. "I don't think so?we're too young."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought perhaps," he went on miserably, "that you, with your intensity
 in things, might have given me more?than I could ever make up to
 you. And even now?if you think it better?we'll be engaged."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now Miriam wanted to cry. And she was angry, too. He was always such a
 child for people to do as they liked with.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I don't think so," she said firmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pondered a minute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see," he said, "with me?I don't think one person would ever
 monopolize me?be everything to me?I think never."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This she did not consider.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she murmured. Then, after a pause, she looked at him, and her dark
 eyes flashed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is your mother," she said. "I know she never liked me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, it isn't," he said hastily. "It was for your sake she spoke this
 time. She only said, if I was going on, I ought to consider myself
 engaged." There was a silence. "And if I ask you to come down any time,
 you won't stop away, will you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not answer. By this time she was very angry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what shall we do?" she said shortly. "I suppose I'd better drop
 French. I was just beginning to get on with it. But I suppose I can go on
 alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't see that we need," he said. "I can give you a French lesson,
 surely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?and there are Sunday nights. I shan't stop coming to chapel,
 because I enjoy it, and it's all the social life I get. But you've no need
 to come home with me. I can go alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," he answered, rather taken aback. "But if I ask Edgar, he'll
 always come with us, and then they can say nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was silence. After all, then, she would not lose much. For all their
 talk down at his home there would not be much difference. She wished they
 would mind their own business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you won't think about it, and let it trouble you, will you?" he
 asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no," replied Miriam, without looking at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was silent. She thought him unstable. He had no fixity of purpose, no
 anchor of righteousness that held him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because," he continued, "a man gets across his bicycle?and goes to
 work?and does all sorts of things. But a woman broods."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I shan't bother," said Miriam. And she meant it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It had gone rather chilly. They went indoors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How white Paul looks!" Mrs. Leivers exclaimed. "Miriam, you shouldn't
 have let him sit out of doors. Do you think you've taken cold, Paul?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no!" he laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he felt done up. It wore him out, the conflict in himself. Miriam
 pitied him now. But quite early, before nine o'clock, he rose to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're not going home, are you?" asked Mrs. Leivers anxiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he replied. "I said I'd be early." He was very awkward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But this IS early," said Mrs. Leivers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam sat in the rocking-chair, and did not speak. He hesitated,
 expecting her to rise and go with him to the barn as usual for his
 bicycle. She remained as she was. He was at a loss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?good-night, all!" he faltered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She spoke her good-night along with all the others. But as he went past
 the window he looked in. She saw him pale, his brows knit slightly in a
 way that had become constant with him, his eyes dark with pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose and went to the doorway to wave good-bye to him as he passed
 through the gate. He rode slowly under the pine-trees, feeling a cur and a
 miserable wretch. His bicycle went tilting down the hills at random. He
 thought it would be a relief to break one's neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two days later he sent her up a book and a little note, urging her to read
 and be busy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this time he gave all his friendship to Edgar. He loved the family so
 much, he loved the farm so much; it was the dearest place on earth to him.
 His home was not so lovable. It was his mother. But then he would have
 been just as happy with his mother anywhere. Whereas Willey Farm he loved
 passionately. He loved the little pokey kitchen, where men's boots
 tramped, and the dog slept with one eye open for fear of being trodden on;
 where the lamp hung over the table at night, and everything was so silent.
 He loved Miriam's long, low parlour, with its atmosphere of romance, its
 flowers, its books, its high rosewood piano. He loved the gardens and the
 buildings that stood with their scarlet roofs on the naked edges of the
 fields, crept towards the wood as if for cosiness, the wild country
 scooping down a valley and up the uncultured hills of the other side. Only
 to be there was an exhilaration and a joy to him. He loved Mrs. Leivers,
 with her unworldliness and her quaint cynicism; he loved Mr. Leivers, so
 warm and young and lovable; he loved Edgar, who lit up when he came, and
 the boys and the children and Bill?even the sow Circe and the Indian
 game-cock called Tippoo. All this besides Miriam. He could not give it up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he went as often, but he was usually with Edgar. Only all the family,
 including the father, joined in charades and games at evening. And later,
 Miriam drew them together, and they read Macbeth out of penny books,
 taking parts. It was great excitement. Miriam was glad, and Mrs. Leivers
 was glad, and Mr. Leivers enjoyed it. Then they all learned songs together
 from tonic sol-fa, singing in a circle round the fire. But now Paul was
 very rarely alone with Miriam. She waited. When she and Edgar and he
 walked home together from chapel or from the literary society in Bestwood,
 she knew his talk, so passionate and so unorthodox nowadays, was for her.
 She did envy Edgar, however, his cycling with Paul, his Friday nights, his
 days working in the fields. For her Friday nights and her French lessons
 were gone. She was nearly always alone, walking, pondering in the wood,
 reading, studying, dreaming, waiting. And he wrote to her frequently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One Sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony. Edgar had
 stayed to Communion?he wondered what it was like?with Mrs.
 Morel. So Paul came on alone with Miriam to his home. He was more or less
 under her spell again. As usual, they were discussing the sermon. He was
 setting now full sail towards Agnosticism, but such a religious
 Agnosticism that Miriam did not suffer so badly. They were at the Renan
 Vie de Jesus stage. Miriam was the threshing-floor on which he threshed
 out all his beliefs. While he trampled his ideas upon her soul, the truth
 came out for him. She alone was his threshing-floor. She alone helped him
 towards realization. Almost impassive, she submitted to his argument and
 expounding. And somehow, because of her, he gradually realized where he
 was wrong. And what he realized, she realized. She felt he could not do
 without her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They came to the silent house. He took the key out of the scullery window,
 and they entered. All the time he went on with his discussion. He lit the
 gas, mended the fire, and brought her some cakes from the pantry. She sat
 on the sofa, quietly, with a plate on her knee. She wore a large white hat
 with some pinkish flowers. It was a cheap hat, but he liked it. Her face
 beneath was still and pensive, golden-brown and ruddy. Always her ears
 were hid in her short curls. She watched him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She liked him on Sundays. Then he wore a dark suit that showed the lithe
 movement of his body. There was a clean, clear-cut look about him. He went
 on with his thinking to her. Suddenly he reached for a Bible. Miriam liked
 the way he reached up?so sharp, straight to the mark. He turned the
 pages quickly, and read her a chapter of St. John. As he sat in the
 armchair reading, intent, his voice only thinking, she felt as if he were
 using her unconsciously as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent
 on. She loved it. And the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to
 something, and it was as if she were what he reached with. She sat back on
 the sofa away from him, and yet feeling herself the very instrument his
 hand grasped. It gave her great pleasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he began to falter and to get self-conscious. And when he came to the
 verse, "A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow because her hour is
 come", he missed it out. Miriam had felt him growing uncomfortable. She
 shrank when the well-known words did not follow. He went on reading, but
 she did not hear. A grief and shame made her bend her head. Six months ago
 he would have read it simply. Now there was a scotch in his running with
 her. Now she felt there was really something hostile between them,
 something of which they were ashamed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She ate her cake mechanically. He tried to go on with his argument, but
 could not get back the right note. Soon Edgar came in. Mrs. Morel had gone
 to her friends'. The three set off to Willey Farm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam brooded over his split with her. There was something else he
 wanted. He could not be satisfied; he could give her no peace. There was
 between them now always a ground for strife. She wanted to prove him. She
 believed that his chief need in life was herself. If she could prove it,
 both to herself and to him, the rest might go; she could simply trust to
 the future.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So in May she asked him to come to Willey Farm and meet Mrs. Dawes. There
 was something he hankered after. She saw him, whenever they spoke of Clara
 Dawes, rouse and get slightly angry. He said he did not like her. Yet he
 was keen to know about her. Well, he should put himself to the test. She
 believed that there were in him desires for higher things, and desires for
 lower, and that the desire for the higher would conquer. At any rate, he
 should try. She forgot that her "higher" and "lower" were arbitrary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was rather excited at the idea of meeting Clara at Willey Farm. Mrs.
 Dawes came for the day. Her heavy, dun-coloured hair was coiled on top of
 her head. She wore a white blouse and navy skirt, and somehow, wherever
 she was, seemed to make things look paltry and insignificant. When she was
 in the room, the kitchen seemed too small and mean altogether. Miriam's
 beautiful twilighty parlour looked stiff and stupid. All the Leivers were
 eclipsed like candles. They found her rather hard to put up with. Yet she
 was perfectly amiable, but indifferent, and rather hard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul did not come till afternoon. He was early. As he swung off his
 bicycle, Miriam saw him look round at the house eagerly. He would be
 disappointed if the visitor had not come. Miriam went out to meet him,
 bowing her head because of the sunshine. Nasturtiums were coming out
 crimson under the cool green shadow of their leaves. The girl stood,
 dark-haired, glad to see him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hasn't Clara come?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Miriam in her musical tone. "She's reading."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wheeled his bicycle into the barn. He had put on a handsome tie, of
 which he was rather proud, and socks to match.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She came this morning?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Miriam, as she walked at his side. "You said you'd bring me
 that letter from the man at Liberty's. Have you remembered?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, dash, no!" he said. "But nag at me till you get it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't like to nag at you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do it whether or not. And is she any more agreeable?" he continued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know I always think she is quite agreeable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was silent. Evidently his eagerness to be early to-day had been the
 newcomer. Miriam already began to suffer. They went together towards the
 house. He took the clips off his trousers, but was too lazy to brush the
 dust from his shoes, in spite of the socks and tie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara sat in the cool parlour reading. He saw the nape of her white neck,
 and the fine hair lifted from it. She rose, looking at him indifferently.
 To shake hands she lifted her arm straight, in a manner that seemed at
 once to keep him at a distance, and yet to fling something to him. He
 noticed how her breasts swelled inside her blouse, and how her shoulder
 curved handsomely under the thin muslin at the top of her arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have chosen a fine day," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It happens so," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he said; "I am glad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down, not thanking him for his politeness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What have you been doing all morning?" asked Paul of Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you see," said Miriam, coughing huskily, "Clara only came with
 father?and so?she's not been here very long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara sat leaning on the table, holding aloof. He noticed her hands were
 large, but well kept. And the skin on them seemed almost coarse, opaque,
 and white, with fine golden hairs. She did not mind if he observed her
 hands. She intended to scorn him. Her heavy arm lay negligently on the
 table. Her mouth was closed as if she were offended, and she kept her face
 slightly averted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were at Margaret Bonford's meeting the other evening," he said to
 her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam did not know this courteous Paul. Clara glanced at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," asked Miriam, "how do you know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I went in for a few minutes before the train came," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara turned away again rather disdainfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think she's a lovable little woman," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret Bonford!" exclaimed Clara. "She's a great deal cleverer than
 most men."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I didn't say she wasn't," he said, deprecating. "She's lovable for
 all that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And, of course, that is all that matters," said Clara witheringly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rubbed his head, rather perplexed, rather annoyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose it matters more than her cleverness," he said; "which, after
 all, would never get her to heaven."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not heaven she wants to get?it's her fair share on earth,"
 retorted Clara. She spoke as if he were responsible for some deprivation
 which Miss Bonford suffered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "I thought she was warm, and awfully nice?only too
 frail. I wished she was sitting comfortably in peace?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Darning her husband's stockings,'" said Clara scathingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sure she wouldn't mind darning even my stockings," he said. "And I'm
 sure she'd do them well. Just as I wouldn't mind blacking her boots if she
 wanted me to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Clara refused to answer this sally of his. He talked to Miriam for a
 little while. The other woman held aloof.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "I think I'll go and see Edgar. Is he on the land?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I believe," said Miriam, "he's gone for a load of coal. He should be back
 directly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then," he said, "I'll go and meet him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam dared not propose anything for the three of them. He rose and left
 them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the top road, where the gorse was out, he saw Edgar walking lazily
 beside the mare, who nodded her white-starred forehead as she dragged the
 clanking load of coal. The young farmer's face lighted up as he saw his
 friend. Edgar was good-looking, with dark, warm eyes. His clothes were old
 and rather disreputable, and he walked with considerable pride.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!" he said, seeing Paul bareheaded. "Where are you going?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Came to meet you. Can't stand 'Nevermore.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar's teeth flashed in a laugh of amusement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is 'Nevermore'?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The lady?Mrs. Dawes?it ought to be Mrs. The Raven that
 quothed 'Nevermore.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar laughed with glee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you like her?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not a fat lot," said Paul. "Why, do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" The answer came with a deep ring of conviction. "No!" Edgar pursed
 up his lips. "I can't say she's much in my line." He mused a little. Then:
 "But why do you call her 'Nevermore'?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Paul, "if she looks at a man she says haughtily 'Nevermore,'
 and if she looks at herself in the looking-glass she says disdainfully
 'Nevermore,' and if she thinks back she says it in disgust, and if she
 looks forward she says it cynically."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar considered this speech, failed to make much out of it, and said,
 laughing:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You think she's a man-hater?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "SHE thinks she is," replied Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you don't think so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," replied Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wasn't she nice with you, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Could you imagine her NICE with anybody?" asked the young man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar laughed. Together they unloaded the coal in the yard. Paul was
 rather self-conscious, because he knew Clara could see if she looked out
 of the window. She didn't look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Saturday afternoons the horses were brushed down and groomed. Paul and
 Edgar worked together, sneezing with the dust that came from the pelts of
 Jimmy and Flower.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know a new song to teach me?" said Edgar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He continued to work all the time. The back of his neck was sun-red when
 he bent down, and his fingers that held the brush were thick. Paul watched
 him sometimes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Mary Morrison'?" suggested the younger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar agreed. He had a good tenor voice, and he loved to learn all the
 songs his friend could teach him, so that he could sing whilst he was
 carting. Paul had a very indifferent baritone voice, but a good ear.
 However, he sang softly, for fear of Clara. Edgar repeated the line in a
 clear tenor. At times they both broke off to sneeze, and first one, then
 the other, abused his horse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was impatient of men. It took so little to amuse them?even
 Paul. She thought it anomalous in him that he could be so thoroughly
 absorbed in a triviality.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was tea-time when they had finished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What song was that?" asked Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edgar told her. The conversation turned to singing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have such jolly times," Miriam said to Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Dawes ate her meal in a slow, dignified way. Whenever the men were
 present she grew distant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you like singing?" Miriam asked her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it is good," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul, of course, coloured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean if it is high-class and trained?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think a voice needs training before the singing is anything," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You might as well insist on having people's voices trained before you
 allowed them to talk," he replied. "Really, people sing for their own
 pleasure, as a rule."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And it may be for other people's discomfort."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then the other people should have flaps to their ears," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys laughed. There was a silence. He flushed deeply, and ate in
 silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After tea, when all the men had gone but Paul, Mrs. Leivers said to Clara:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you find life happier now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Infinitely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you are satisfied?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long as I can be free and independent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you don't MISS anything in your life?" asked Mrs. Leivers gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've put all that behind me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul had been feeling uncomfortable during this discourse. He got up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll find you're always tumbling over the things you've put behind
 you," he said. Then he took his departure to the cowsheds. He felt he had
 been witty, and his manly pride was high. He whistled as he went down the
 brick track.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam came for him a little later to know if he would go with Clara and
 her for a walk. They set off down to Strelley Mill Farm. As they were
 going beside the brook, on the Willey Water side, looking through the
 brake at the edge of the wood, where pink campions glowed under a few
 sunbeams, they saw, beyond the tree-trunks and the thin hazel bushes, a
 man leading a great bay horse through the gullies. The big red beast
 seemed to dance romantically through that dimness of green hazel drift,
 away there where the air was shadowy, as if it were in the past, among the
 fading bluebells that might have bloomed for Deidre or Iseult.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The three stood charmed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a treat to be a knight," he said, "and to have a pavilion here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And to have us shut up safely?" replied Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he answered, "singing with your maids at your broidery. I would
 carry your banner of white and green and heliotrope. I would have
 'W.S.P.U.' emblazoned on my shield, beneath a woman rampant."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have no doubt," said Clara, "that you would much rather fight for a
 woman than let her fight for herself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I would. When she fights for herself she seems like a dog before a
 looking-glass, gone into a mad fury with its own shadow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And YOU are the looking-glass?" she asked, with a curl of the lip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or the shadow," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am afraid," she said, "that you are too clever."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I leave it to you to be GOOD," he retorted, laughing. "Be good,
 sweet maid, and just let ME be clever."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Clara wearied of his flippancy. Suddenly, looking at her, he saw that
 the upward lifting of her face was misery and not scorn. His heart grew
 tender for everybody. He turned and was gentle with Miriam, whom he had
 neglected till then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the wood's edge they met Limb, a thin, swarthy man of forty, tenant of
 Strelley Mill, which he ran as a cattle-raising farm. He held the halter
 of the powerful stallion indifferently, as if he were tired. The three
 stood to let him pass over the stepping-stones of the first brook. Paul
 admired that so large an animal should walk on such springy toes, with an
 endless excess of vigour. Limb pulled up before them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell your father, Miss Leivers," he said, in a peculiar piping voice,
 "that his young beas'es 'as broke that bottom fence three days an'
 runnin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which?" asked Miriam, tremulous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The great horse breathed heavily, shifting round its red flanks, and
 looking suspiciously with its wonderful big eyes upwards from under its
 lowered head and falling mane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come along a bit," replied Limb, "an' I'll show you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man and the stallion went forward. It danced sideways, shaking its
 white fetlocks and looking frightened, as it felt itself in the brook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No hanky-pankyin'," said the man affectionately to the beast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It went up the bank in little leaps, then splashed finely through the
 second brook. Clara, walking with a kind of sulky abandon, watched it
 half-fascinated, half-contemptuous. Limb stopped and pointed to the fence
 under some willows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, you see where they got through," he said. "My man's druv 'em back
 three times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," answered Miriam, colouring as if she were at fault.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you comin' in?" asked the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thanks; but we should like to go by the pond."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, just as you've a mind," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The horse gave little whinneys of pleasure at being so near home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is glad to be back," said Clara, who was interested in the creature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?'e's been a tidy step to-day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went through the gate, and saw approaching them from the big
 farmhouse a smallish, dark, excitable-looking woman of about thirty-five.
 Her hair was touched with grey, her dark eyes looked wild. She walked with
 her hands behind her back. Her brother went forward. As it saw her, the
 big bay stallion whinneyed again. She came up excitedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you home again, my boy!" she said tenderly to the horse, not to the
 man. The great beast shifted round to her, ducking his head. She smuggled
 into his mouth the wrinkled yellow apple she had been hiding behind her
 back, then she kissed him near the eyes. He gave a big sigh of pleasure.
 She held his head in her arms against her breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't he splendid!" said Miriam to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Limb looked up. Her dark eyes glanced straight at Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, good-evening, Miss Leivers," she said. "It's ages since you've been
 down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam introduced her friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your horse IS a fine fellow!" said Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't he!" Again she kissed him. "As loving as any man!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "More loving than most men, I should think," replied Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's a nice boy!" cried the woman, again embracing the horse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara, fascinated by the big beast, went up to stroke his neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's quite gentle," said Miss Limb. "Don't you think big fellows are?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's a beauty!" replied Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wanted to look in his eyes. She wanted him to look at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pity he can't talk," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, but he can?all but," replied the other woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then her brother moved on with the horse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you coming in? DO come in, Mr.?I didn't catch it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Morel," said Miriam. "No, we won't come in, but we should like to go by
 the mill-pond."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?yes, do. Do you fish, Mr. Morel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because if you do you might come and fish any time," said Miss Limb. "We
 scarcely see a soul from week's end to week's end. I should be thankful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What fish are there in the pond?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went through the front garden, over the sluice, and up the steep bank
 to the pond, which lay in shadow, with its two wooded islets. Paul walked
 with Miss Limb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't mind swimming here," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do," she replied. "Come when you like. My brother will be awfully pleased
 to talk with you. He is so quiet, because there is no one to talk to. Do
 come and swim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara came up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a fine depth," she said, "and so clear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Miss Limb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you swim?" said Paul. "Miss Limb was just saying we could come when we
 liked."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course there's the farm-hands," said Miss Limb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They talked a few moments, then went on up the wild hill, leaving the
 lonely, haggard-eyed woman on the bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hillside was all ripe with sunshine. It was wild and tussocky, given
 over to rabbits. The three walked in silence. Then:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She makes me feel uncomfortable," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean Miss Limb?" asked Miriam. "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's a matter with her? Is she going dotty with being too lonely?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Miriam. "It's not the right sort of life for her. I think it's
 cruel to bury her there. I really ought to go and see her more. But?she
 upsets me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She makes me feel sorry for her?yes, and she bothers me," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose," blurted Clara suddenly, "she wants a man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other two were silent for a few moments.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's the loneliness sends her cracked," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara did not answer, but strode on uphill. She was walking with her hand
 hanging, her legs swinging as she kicked through the dead thistles and the
 tussocky grass, her arms hanging loose. Rather than walking, her handsome
 body seemed to be blundering up the hill. A hot wave went over Paul. He
 was curious about her. Perhaps life had been cruel to her. He forgot
 Miriam, who was walking beside him talking to him. She glanced at him,
 finding he did not answer her. His eyes were fixed ahead on Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you still think she is disagreeable?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not notice that the question was sudden. It ran with his thoughts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Something's the matter with her," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," answered Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found at the top of the hill a hidden wild field, two sides of which
 were backed by the wood, the other sides by high loose hedges of hawthorn
 and elder bushes. Between these overgrown bushes were gaps that the cattle
 might have walked through had there been any cattle now. There the turf
 was smooth as velveteen, padded and holed by the rabbits. The field itself
 was coarse, and crowded with tall, big cowslips that had never been cut.
 Clusters of strong flowers rose everywhere above the coarse tussocks of
 bent. It was like a roadstead crowded with tan, fairy shipping.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" cried Miriam, and she looked at Paul, her dark eyes dilating. He
 smiled. Together they enjoyed the field of flowers. Clara, a little way
 off, was looking at the cowslips disconsolately. Paul and Miriam stayed
 close together, talking in subdued tones. He kneeled on one knee, quickly
 gathering the best blossoms, moving from tuft to tuft restlessly, talking
 softly all the time. Miriam plucked the flowers lovingly, lingering over
 them. He always seemed to her too quick and almost scientific. Yet his
 bunches had a natural beauty more than hers. He loved them, but as if they
 were his and he had a right to them. She had more reverence for them: they
 held something she had not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The flowers were very fresh and sweet. He wanted to drink them. As he
 gathered them, he ate the little yellow trumpets. Clara was still
 wandering about disconsolately. Going towards her, he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you get some?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't believe in it. They look better growing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you'd like some?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They want to be left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't believe they do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want the corpses of flowers about me," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a stiff, artificial notion," he said. "They don't die any quicker
 in water than on their roots. And besides, they LOOK nice in a bowl?they
 look jolly. And you only call a thing a corpse because it looks
 corpse-like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whether it is one or not?" she argued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't one to me. A dead flower isn't a corpse of a flower."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara now ignored him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And even so?what right have you to pull them?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I like them, and want them?and there's plenty of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And that is sufficient?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Why not? I'm sure they'd smell nice in your room in Nottingham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I should have the pleasure of watching them die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But then?it does not matter if they do die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon he left her, and went stooping over the clumps of tangled
 flowers which thickly sprinkled the field like pale, luminous foam-clots.
 Miriam had come close. Clara was kneeling, breathing some scent from the
 cowslips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think," said Miriam, "if you treat them with reverence you don't do
 them any harm. It is the spirit you pluck them in that matters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he said. "But no, you get 'em because you want 'em, and that's
 all." He held out his bunch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam was silent. He picked some more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at these!" he continued; "sturdy and lusty like little trees and
 like boys with fat legs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara's hat lay on the grass not far off. She was kneeling, bending
 forward still to smell the flowers. Her neck gave him a sharp pang, such a
 beautiful thing, yet not proud of itself just now. Her breasts swung
 slightly in her blouse. The arching curve of her back was beautiful and
 strong; she wore no stays. Suddenly, without knowing, he was scattering a
 handful of cowslips over her hair and neck, saying:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust,
 If the Lord won't have you the devil must."
</pre>
 <p>
 The chill flowers fell on her neck. She looked up at him, with almost
 pitiful, scared grey eyes, wondering what he was doing. Flowers fell on
 her face, and she shut her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly, standing there above her, he felt awkward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought you wanted a funeral," he said, ill at ease.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara laughed strangely, and rose, picking the cowslips from her hair. She
 took up her hat and pinned it on. One flower had remained tangled in her
 hair. He saw, but would not tell her. He gathered up the flowers he had
 sprinkled over her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the edge of the wood the bluebells had flowed over into the field and
 stood there like flood-water. But they were fading now. Clara strayed up
 to them. He wandered after her. The bluebells pleased him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look how they've come out of the wood!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she turned with a flash of warmth and of gratitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His blood beat up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It makes me think of the wild men of the woods, how terrified they would
 be when they got breast to breast with the open space."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think they were?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder which was more frightened among old tribes?those bursting
 out of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light, or those from
 the open tiptoeing into the forests."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think the second," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you DO feel like one of the open space sort, trying to force
 yourself into the dark, don't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How should I know?" she answered queerly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The conversation ended there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The evening was deepening over the earth. Already the valley was full of
 shadow. One tiny square of light stood opposite at Crossleigh Bank Farm.
 Brightness was swimming on the tops of the hills. Miriam came up slowly,
 her face in her big, loose bunch of flowers, walking ankle-deep through
 the scattered froth of the cowslips. Beyond her the trees were coming into
 shape, all shadow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall we go?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the three turned away. They were all silent. Going down the path they
 could see the light of home right across, and on the ridge of the hill a
 thin dark outline with little lights, where the colliery village touched
 the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It has been nice, hasn't it?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam murmured assent. Clara was silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you think so?" he persisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she walked with her head up, and still did not answer. He could tell
 by the way she moved, as if she didn't care, that she suffered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this time Paul took his mother to Lincoln. She was bright and
 enthusiastic as ever, but as he sat opposite her in the railway carriage,
 she seemed to look frail. He had a momentary sensation as if she were
 slipping away from him. Then he wanted to get hold of her, to fasten her,
 almost to chain her. He felt he must keep hold of her with his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They drew near to the city. Both were at the window looking for the
 cathedral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There she is, mother!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They saw the great cathedral lying couchant above the plain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" she exclaimed. "So she is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at his mother. Her blue eyes were watching the cathedral
 quietly. She seemed again to be beyond him. Something in the eternal
 repose of the uplifted cathedral, blue and noble against the sky, was
 reflected in her, something of the fatality. What was, WAS. With all his
 young will he could not alter it. He saw her face, the skin still fresh
 and pink and downy, but crow's-feet near her eyes, her eyelids steady,
 sinking a little, her mouth always closed with disillusion; and there was
 on her the same eternal look, as if she knew fate at last. He beat against
 it with all the strength of his soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look, mother, how big she is above the town! Think, there are streets and
 streets below her! She looks bigger than the city altogether."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So she does!" exclaimed his mother, breaking bright into life again. But
 he had seen her sitting, looking steady out of the window at the
 cathedral, her face and eyes fixed, reflecting the relentlessness of life.
 And the crow's-feet near her eyes, and her mouth shut so hard, made him
 feel he would go mad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They ate a meal that she considered wildly extravagant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't imagine I like it," she said, as she ate her cutlet. "I DON'T like
 it, I really don't! Just THINK of your money wasted!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You never mind my money," he said. "You forget I'm a fellow taking his
 girl for an outing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he bought her some blue violets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop it at once, sir!" she commanded. "How can I do it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've got nothing to do. Stand still!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in the middle of High Street he stuck the flowers in her coat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An old thing like me!" she said, sniffing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see," he said, "I want people to think we're awful swells. So look
 ikey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll jowl your head," she laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Strut!" he commanded. "Be a fantail pigeon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It took him an hour to get her through the street. She stood above Glory
 Hole, she stood before Stone Bow, she stood everywhere, and exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man came up, took off his hat, and bowed to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I show you the town, madam?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thank you," she answered. "I've got my son."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Paul was cross with her for not answering with more dignity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You go away with you!" she exclaimed. "Ha! that's the Jew's House. Now,
 do you remember that lecture, Paul??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she could scarcely climb the cathedral hill. He did not notice. Then
 suddenly he found her unable to speak. He took her into a little
 public-house, where she rested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's nothing," she said. "My heart is only a bit old; one must expect
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not answer, but looked at her. Again his heart was crushed in a hot
 grip. He wanted to cry, he wanted to smash things in fury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They set off again, pace by pace, so slowly. And every step seemed like a
 weight on his chest. He felt as if his heart would burst. At last they
 came to the top. She stood enchanted, looking at the castle gate, looking
 at the cathedral front. She had quite forgotten herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now THIS is better than I thought it could be!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he hated it. Everywhere he followed her, brooding. They sat together
 in the cathedral. They attended a little service in the choir. She was
 timid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose it is open to anybody?" she asked him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he replied. "Do you think they'd have the damned cheek to send us
 away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm sure," she exclaimed, "they would if they heard your language."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her face seemed to shine again with joy and peace during the service. And
 all the time he was wanting to rage and smash things and cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Afterwards, when they were leaning over the wall, looking at the town
 below, he blurted suddenly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why can't a man have a YOUNG mother? What is she old for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," his mother laughed, "she can scarcely help it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why wasn't I the oldest son? Look?they say the young ones have
 the advantage?but look, THEY had the young mother. You should have
 had me for your eldest son."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't arrange it," she remonstrated. "Come to consider, you're as much
 to blame as me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned on her, white, his eyes furious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you old for!" he said, mad with his impotence. "WHY can't you
 walk? WHY can't you come with me to places?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At one time," she replied, "I could have run up that hill a good deal
 better than you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the good of that to ME?" he cried, hitting his fist on the wall.
 Then he became plaintive. "It's too bad of you to be ill. Little, it is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ill!" she cried. "I'm a bit old, and you'll have to put up with it,
 that's all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were quiet. But it was as much as they could bear. They got jolly
 again over tea. As they sat by Brayford, watching the boats, he told her
 about Clara. His mother asked him innumerable questions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then who does she live with?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With her mother, on Bluebell Hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And have they enough to keep them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think so. I think they do lace work."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And wherein lies her charm, my boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know that she's charming, mother. But she's nice. And she seems
 straight, you know?not a bit deep, not a bit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But she's a good deal older than you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's thirty, I'm going on twenty-three."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You haven't told me what you like her for."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I don't know?a sort of defiant way she's got?a sort
 of angry way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel considered. She would have been glad now for her son to fall in
 love with some woman who would?she did not know what. But he fretted
 so, got so furious suddenly, and again was melancholic. She wished he knew
 some nice woman?She did not know what she wished, but left it vague.
 At any rate, she was not hostile to the idea of Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie, too, was getting married. Leonard had gone away to work in
 Birmingham. One week-end when he was home she had said to him:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't look very well, my lad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I dunno," he said. "I feel anyhow or nohow, ma."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He called her "ma" already in his boyish fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you sure they're good lodgings?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?yes. Only?it's a winder when you have to pour your own
 tea out?an' nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and sup
 it up. It somehow takes a' the taste out of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so it knocks you up?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I dunno. I want to get married," he blurted, twisting his fingers and
 looking down at his boots. There was a silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," she exclaimed, "I thought you said you'd wait another year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I did say so," he replied stubbornly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again she considered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you know," she said, "Annie's a bit of a spendthrift. She's saved no
 more than eleven pounds. And I know, lad, you haven't had much chance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He coloured up to the ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got thirty-three quid," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It doesn't go far," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He said nothing, but twisted his fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you know," she said, "I've nothing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't want, ma!" he cried, very red, suffering and remonstrating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my lad, I know. I was only wishing I had. And take away five pounds
 for the wedding and things?it leaves twenty-nine pounds. You won't
 do much on that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He twisted still, impotent, stubborn, not looking up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But do you really want to get married?" she asked. "Do you feel as if you
 ought?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He gave her one straight look from his blue eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then," she replied, "we must all do the best we can for it, lad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next time he looked up there were tears in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want Annie to feel handicapped," he said, struggling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My lad," she said, "you're steady?you've got a decent place. If a
 man had NEEDED me I'd have married him on his last week's wages. She may
 find it a bit hard to start humbly. Young girls ARE like that. They look
 forward to the fine home they think they'll have. But I had expensive
 furniture. It's not everything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the wedding took place almost immediately. Arthur came home, and was
 splendid in uniform. Annie looked nice in a dove-grey dress that she could
 take for Sundays. Morel called her a fool for getting married, and was
 cool with his son-in-law. Mrs. Morel had white tips in her bonnet, and
 some white on her blouse, and was teased by both her sons for fancying
 herself so grand. Leonard was jolly and cordial, and felt a fearful fool.
 Paul could not quite see what Annie wanted to get married for. He was fond
 of her, and she of him. Still, he hoped rather lugubriously that it would
 turn out all right. Arthur was astonishingly handsome in his scarlet and
 yellow, and he knew it well, but was secretly ashamed of the uniform.
 Annie cried her eyes up in the kitchen, on leaving her mother. Mrs. Morel
 cried a little, then patted her on the back and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But don't cry, child, he'll be good to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel stamped and said she was a fool to go and tie herself up. Leonard
 looked white and overwrought. Mrs. Morel said to him:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I s'll trust her to you, my lad, and hold you responsible for her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can," he said, nearly dead with the ordeal. And it was all over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Morel and Arthur were in bed, Paul sat talking, as he often did, with
 his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're not sorry she's married, mother, are you?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not sorry she's married?but?it seems strange that she
 should go from me. It even seems to me hard that she can prefer to go with
 her Leonard. That's how mothers are?I know it's silly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And shall you be miserable about her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When I think of my own wedding day," his mother answered, "I can only
 hope her life will be different."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you can trust him to be good to her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes. They say he's not good enough for her. But I say if a man is
 GENUINE, as he is, and a girl is fond of him?then?it should be
 all right. He's as good as she."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you don't mind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I would NEVER have let a daughter of mine marry a man I didn't FEEL to be
 genuine through and through. And yet, there's a gap now she's gone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were both miserable, and wanted her back again. It seemed to Paul his
 mother looked lonely, in her new black silk blouse with its bit of white
 trimming.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At any rate, mother, I s'll never marry," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, they all say that, my lad. You've not met the one yet. Only wait a
 year or two."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I shan't marry, mother. I shall live with you, and we'll have a
 servant."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, my lad, it's easy to talk. We'll see when the time comes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What time? I'm nearly twenty-three."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you're not one that would marry young. But in three years' time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall be with you just the same."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We'll see, my boy, we'll see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you don't want me to marry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't like to think of you going through your life without anybody
 to care for you and do?no."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you think I ought to marry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sooner or later every man ought."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you'd rather it were later."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would be hard?and very hard. It's as they say:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "'A son's my son till he takes him a wife,
 But my daughter's my daughter the whole of her life.'"
</pre>
 <p>
 "And you think I'd let a wife take me from you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you wouldn't ask her to marry your mother as well as you," Mrs.
 Morel smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She could do what she liked; she wouldn't have to interfere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She wouldn't?till she'd got you?and then you'd see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never will see. I'll never marry while I've got you?I won't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I shouldn't like to leave you with nobody, my boy," she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're not going to leave me. What are you? Fifty-three! I'll give you
 till seventy-five. There you are, I'm fat and forty-four. Then I'll marry
 a staid body. See!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother sat and laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go to bed," she said?"go to bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And we'll have a pretty house, you and me, and a servant, and it'll be
 just all right. I s'll perhaps be rich with my painting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you go to bed!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And then you s'll have a pony-carriage. See yourself?a little Queen
 Victoria trotting round."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell you to go to bed," she laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He kissed her and went. His plans for the future were always the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel sat brooding?about her daughter, about Paul, about
 Arthur. She fretted at losing Annie. The family was very closely bound.
 And she felt she MUST live now, to be with her children. Life was so rich
 for her. Paul wanted her, and so did Arthur. Arthur never knew how deeply
 he loved her. He was a creature of the moment. Never yet had he been
 forced to realise himself. The army had disciplined his body, but not his
 soul. He was in perfect health and very handsome. His dark, vigorous hair
 sat close to his smallish head. There was something childish about his
 nose, something almost girlish about his dark blue eyes. But he had the
 fun red mouth of a man under his brown moustache, and his jaw was strong.
 It was his father's mouth; it was the nose and eyes of her own mother's
 people?good-looking, weak-principled folk. Mrs. Morel was anxious
 about him. Once he had really run the rig he was safe. But how far would
 he go?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The army had not really done him any good. He resented bitterly the
 authority of the officers. He hated having to obey as if he were an
 animal. But he had too much sense to kick. So he turned his attention to
 getting the best out of it. He could sing, he was a boon-companion. Often
 he got into scrapes, but they were the manly scrapes that are easily
 condoned. So he made a good time out of it, whilst his self-respect was in
 suppression. He trusted to his good looks and handsome figure, his
 refinement, his decent education to get him most of what he wanted, and he
 was not disappointed. Yet he was restless. Something seemed to gnaw him
 inside. He was never still, he was never alone. With his mother he was
 rather humble. Paul he admired and loved and despised slightly. And Paul
 admired and loved and despised him slightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel had had a few pounds left to her by her father, and she decided
 to buy her son out of the army. He was wild with joy. Now he was like a
 lad taking a holiday.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had always been fond of Beatrice Wyld, and during his furlough he
 picked up with her again. She was stronger and better in health. The two
 often went long walks together, Arthur taking her arm in soldier's
 fashion, rather stiffly. And she came to play the piano whilst he sang.
 Then Arthur would unhook his tunic collar. He grew flushed, his eyes were
 bright, he sang in a manly tenor. Afterwards they sat together on the
 sofa. He seemed to flaunt his body: she was aware of him so?the
 strong chest, the sides, the thighs in their close-fitting trousers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He liked to lapse into the dialect when he talked to her. She would
 sometimes smoke with him. Occasionally she would only take a few whiffs at
 his cigarette.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay," he said to her one evening, when she reached for his cigarette.
 "Nay, tha doesna. I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss if ter's a mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wanted a whiff, no kiss at all," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, an' tha s'lt ha'e a whiff," he said, "along wi' t' kiss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want a draw at thy fag," she cried, snatching for the cigarette between
 his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was sitting with his shoulder touching her. She was small and quick as
 lightning. He just escaped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha'rt a knivey nuisance, Arty Morel," she said, sitting back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha'e a smoke kiss?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The soldier leaned forward to her, smiling. His face was near hers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shonna!" she replied, turning away her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a draw at his cigarette, and pursed up his mouth, and put his lips
 close to her. His dark-brown cropped moustache stood out like a brush. She
 looked at the puckered crimson lips, then suddenly snatched the cigarette
 from his fingers and darted away. He, leaping after her, seized the comb
 from her back hair. She turned, threw the cigarette at him. He picked it
 up, put it in his mouth, and sat down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nuisance!" she cried. "Give me my comb!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was afraid that her hair, specially done for him, would come down. She
 stood with her hands to her head. He hid the comb between his knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've non got it," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cigarette trembled between his lips with laughter as he spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Liar!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'S true as I'm here!" he laughed, showing his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You brazen imp!" she exclaimed, rushing and scuffling for the comb, which
 he had under his knees. As she wrestled with him, pulling at his smooth,
 tight-covered knees, he laughed till he lay back on the sofa shaking with
 laughter. The cigarette fell from his mouth almost singeing his throat.
 Under his delicate tan the blood flushed up, and he laughed till his blue
 eyes were blinded, his throat swollen almost to choking. Then he sat up.
 Beatrice was putting in her comb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tha tickled me, Beat," he said thickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Like a flash her small white hand went out and smacked his face. He
 started up, glaring at her. They stared at each other. Slowly the flush
 mounted her cheek, she dropped her eyes, then her head. He sat down
 sulkily. She went into the scullery to adjust her hair. In private there
 she shed a few tears, she did not know what for.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she returned she was pursed up close. But it was only a film over her
 fire. He, with ruffled hair, was sulking upon the sofa. She sat down
 opposite, in the armchair, and neither spoke. The clock ticked in the
 silence like blows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are a little cat, Beat," he said at length, half apologetically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you shouldn't be brazen," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was again a long silence. He whistled to himself like a man much
 agitated but defiant. Suddenly she went across to him and kissed him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did it, pore fing!" she mocked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lifted his face, smiling curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kiss?" he invited her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren't I?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go on!" he challenged, his mouth lifted to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Deliberately, and with a peculiar quivering smile that seemed to
 overspread her whole body, she put her mouth on his. Immediately his arms
 folded round her. As soon as the long kiss was finished she drew back her
 head from him, put her delicate fingers on his neck, through the open
 collar. Then she closed her eyes, giving herself up again in a kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She acted of her own free will. What she would do she did, and made nobody
 responsible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul felt life changing around him. The conditions of youth were gone. Now
 it was a home of grown-up people. Annie was a married woman, Arthur was
 following his own pleasure in a way unknown to his folk. For so long they
 had all lived at home, and gone out to pass their time. But now, for Annie
 and Arthur, life lay outside their mother's house. They came home for
 holiday and for rest. So there was that strange, half-empty feeling about
 the house, as if the birds had flown. Paul became more and more unsettled.
 Annie and Arthur had gone. He was restless to follow. Yet home was for him
 beside his mother. And still there was something else, something outside,
 something he wanted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He grew more and more restless. Miriam did not satisfy him. His old mad
 desire to be with her grew weaker. Sometimes he met Clara in Nottingham,
 sometimes he went to meetings with her, sometimes he saw her at Willey
 Farm. But on these last occasions the situation became strained. There was
 a triangle of antagonism between Paul and Clara and Miriam. With Clara he
 took on a smart, worldly, mocking tone very antagonistic to Miriam. It did
 not matter what went before. She might be intimate and sad with him. Then
 as soon as Clara appeared, it all vanished, and he played to the newcomer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam had one beautiful evening with him in the hay. He had been on the
 horse-rake, and having finished, came to help her to put the hay in cocks.
 Then he talked to her of his hopes and despairs, and his whole soul seemed
 to lie bare before her. She felt as if she watched the very quivering
 stuff of life in him. The moon came out: they walked home together: he
 seemed to have come to her because he needed her so badly, and she
 listened to him, gave him all her love and her faith. It seemed to her he
 brought her the best of himself to keep, and that she would guard it all
 her life. Nay, the sky did not cherish the stars more surely and eternally
 than she would guard the good in the soul of Paul Morel. She went on home
 alone, feeling exalted, glad in her faith.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then, the next day, Clara came. They were to have tea in the hayfield.
 Miriam watched the evening drawing to gold and shadow. And all the time
 Paul was sporting with Clara. He made higher and higher heaps of hay that
 they were jumping over. Miriam did not care for the game, and stood aside.
 Edgar and Geoffrey and Maurice and Clara and Paul jumped. Paul won,
 because he was light. Clara's blood was roused. She could run like an
 Amazon. Paul loved the determined way she rushed at the hay-cock and
 leaped, landed on the other side, her breasts shaken, her thick hair come
 undone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You touched!" he cried. "You touched!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" she flashed, turning to Edgar. "I didn't touch, did I? Wasn't I
 clear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I couldn't say," laughed Edgar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 None of them could say.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you touched," said Paul. "You're beaten."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did NOT touch!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As plain as anything," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Box his ears for me!" she cried to Edgar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay," Edgar laughed. "I daren't. You must do it yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And nothing can alter the fact that you touched," laughed Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was furious with him. Her little triumph before these lads and men was
 gone. She had forgotten herself in the game. Now he was to humble her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think you are despicable!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And again he laughed, in a way that tortured Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I KNEW you couldn't jump that heap," he teased.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned her back on him. Yet everybody could see that the only person
 she listened to, or was conscious of, was he, and he of her. It pleased
 the men to see this battle between them. But Miriam was tortured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher, she saw. He could be
 unfaithful to himself, unfaithful to the real, deep Paul Morel. There was
 a danger of his becoming frivolous, of his running after his satisfaction
 like any Arthur, or like his father. It made Miriam bitter to think that
 he should throw away his soul for this flippant traffic of triviality with
 Clara. She walked in bitterness and silence, while the other two rallied
 each other, and Paul sported.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And afterwards, he would not own it, but he was rather ashamed of himself,
 and prostrated himself before Miriam. Then again he rebelled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not religious to be religious," he said. "I reckon a crow is
 religious when it sails across the sky. But it only does it because it
 feels itself carried to where it's going, not because it thinks it is
 being eternal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Miriam knew that one should be religious in everything, have God,
 whatever God might be, present in everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't believe God knows such a lot about Himself," he cried. "God
 doesn't KNOW things, He IS things. And I'm sure He's not soulful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then it seemed to her that Paul was arguing God on to his own side,
 because he wanted his own way and his own pleasure. There was a long
 battle between him and her. He was utterly unfaithful to her even in her
 own presence; then he was ashamed, then repentant; then he hated her, and
 went off again. Those were the ever-recurring conditions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She fretted him to the bottom of his soul. There she remained?sad,
 pensive, a worshipper. And he caused her sorrow. Half the time he grieved
 for her, half the time he hated her. She was his conscience; and he felt,
 somehow, he had got a conscience that was too much for him. He could not
 leave her, because in one way she did hold the best of him. He could not
 stay with her because she did not take the rest of him, which was
 three-quarters. So he chafed himself into rawness over her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she was twenty-one he wrote her a letter which could only have been
 written to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "May I speak of our old, worn love, this last time. It, too, is changing,
 is it not? Say, has not the body of that love died, and left you its
 invulnerable soul? You see, I can give you a spirit love, I have given it
 you this long, long time; but not embodied passion. See, you are a nun. I
 have given you what I would give a holy nun?as a mystic monk to a
 mystic nun. Surely you esteem it best. Yet you regret?no, have
 regretted?the other. In all our relations no body enters. I do not
 talk to you through the senses?rather through the spirit. That is
 why we cannot love in the common sense. Ours is not an everyday affection.
 As yet we are mortal, and to live side by side with one another would be
 dreadful, for somehow with you I cannot long be trivial, and, you know, to
 be always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it. If people marry,
 they must live together as affectionate humans, who may be commonplace
 with each other without feeling awkward?not as two souls. So I feel
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ought I to send this letter??I doubt it. But there?it is best
 to understand. Au revoir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam read this letter twice, after which she sealed it up. A year later
 she broke the seal to show her mother the letter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are a nun?you are a nun." The words went into her heart again
 and again. Nothing he ever had said had gone into her so deeply, fixedly,
 like a mortal wound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She answered him two days after the party.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Our intimacy would have been all-beautiful but for one little mistake,'"
 she quoted. "Was the mistake mine?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Almost immediately he replied to her from Nottingham, sending her at the
 same time a little "Omar Khayyam."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am glad you answered; you are so calm and natural you put me to shame.
 What a ranter I am! We are often out of sympathy. But in fundamentals we
 may always be together I think.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and drawing. Many a
 sketch is dedicated to you. I do look forward to your criticisms, which,
 to my shame and glory, are always grand appreciations. It is a lovely
 joke, that. Au revoir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was the end of the first phase of Paul's love affair. He was now
 about twenty-three years old, and, though still virgin, the sex instinct
 that Miriam had over-refined for so long now grew particularly strong.
 Often, as he talked to Clara Dawes, came that thickening and quickening of
 his blood, that peculiar concentration in the breast, as if something were
 alive there, a new self or a new centre of consciousness, warning him that
 sooner or later he would have to ask one woman or another. But he belonged
 to Miriam. Of that she was so fixedly sure that he allowed her right.

 CHAPTER X
 </h2>
 <h3>
 CLARA
 </h3>
 <p>
 WHEN he was twenty-three years old, Paul sent in a landscape to the winter
 exhibition at Nottingham Castle. Miss Jordan had taken a good deal of
 interest in him, and invited him to her house, where he met other artists.
 He was beginning to grow ambitious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One morning the postman came just as he was washing in the scullery.
 Suddenly he heard a wild noise from his mother. Rushing into the kitchen,
 he found her standing on the hearthrug wildly waving a letter and crying
 "Hurrah!" as if she had gone mad. He was shocked and frightened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, mother!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She flew to him, flung her arms round him for a moment, then waved the
 letter, crying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hurrah, my boy! I knew we should do it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was afraid of her?the small, severe woman with graying hair
 suddenly bursting out in such frenzy. The postman came running back,
 afraid something had happened. They saw his tipped cap over the short
 curtains. Mrs. Morel rushed to the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His picture's got first prize, Fred," she cried, "and is sold for twenty
 guineas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word, that's something like!" said the young postman, whom they had
 known all his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And Major Moreton has bought it!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It looks like meanin' something, that does, Mrs. Morel," said the
 postman, his blue eyes bright. He was glad to have brought such a lucky
 letter. Mrs. Morel went indoors and sat down, trembling. Paul was afraid
 lest she might have misread the letter, and might be disappointed after
 all. He scrutinised it once, twice. Yes, he became convinced it was true.
 Then he sat down, his heart beating with joy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't I SAY we should do it!" she said, pretending she was not crying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the kettle off the fire and mashed the tea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You didn't think, mother?" he began tentatively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my son?not so much?but I expected a good deal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But not so much," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?no?but I knew we should do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then she recovered her composure, apparently at least. He sat with his
 shirt turned back, showing his young throat almost like a girl's, and the
 towel in his hand, his hair sticking up wet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twenty guineas, mother! That's just what you wanted to buy Arthur out.
 Now you needn't borrow any. It'll just do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed, I shan't take it all," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I shan't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?you have twelve pounds, I'll have nine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They cavilled about sharing the twenty guineas. She wanted to take only
 the five pounds she needed. He would not hear of it. So they got over the
 stress of emotion by quarrelling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Morel came home at night from the pit, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They tell me Paul's got first prize for his picture, and sold it to Lord
 Henry Bentley for fifty pound."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, what stories people do tell!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha!" he answered. "I said I wor sure it wor a lie. But they said tha'd
 told Fred Hodgkisson."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As if I would tell him such stuff!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha!" assented the miner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he was disappointed nevertheless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's true he has got the first prize," said Mrs. Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The miner sat heavily in his chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has he, beguy!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stared across the room fixedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But as for fifty pounds?such nonsense!" She was silent awhile.
 "Major Moreton bought it for twenty guineas, that's true."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twenty guineas! Tha niver says!" exclaimed Morel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and it was worth it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay!" he said. "I don't misdoubt it. But twenty guineas for a bit of a
 paintin' as he knocked off in an hour or two!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was silent with conceit of his son. Mrs. Morel sniffed, as if it were
 nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And when does he handle th' money?" asked the collier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That I couldn't tell you. When the picture is sent home, I suppose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was silence. Morel stared at the sugar-basin instead of eating his
 dinner. His black arm, with the hand all gnarled with work lay on the
 table. His wife pretended not to see him rub the back of his hand across
 his eyes, nor the smear in the coal-dust on his black face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, an' that other lad 'ud 'a done as much if they hadna ha' killed
 'im," he said quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thought of William went through Mrs. Morel like a cold blade. It left
 her feeling she was tired, and wanted rest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was invited to dinner at Mr. Jordan's. Afterwards he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, I want an evening suit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I was afraid you would," she said. She was glad. There was a moment
 or two of silence. "There's that one of William's," she continued, "that I
 know cost four pounds ten and which he'd only worn three times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Should you like me to wear it, mother?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I think it would fit you?at least the coat. The trousers would
 want shortening."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went upstairs and put on the coat and vest. Coming down, he looked
 strange in a flannel collar and a flannel shirt-front, with an evening
 coat and vest. It was rather large.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The tailor can make it right," she said, smoothing her hand over his
 shoulder. "It's beautiful stuff. I never could find in my heart to let
 your father wear the trousers, and very glad I am now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as she smoothed her hand over the silk collar she thought of her
 eldest son. But this son was living enough inside the clothes. She passed
 her hand down his back to feel him. He was alive and hers. The other was
 dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went out to dinner several times in his evening suit that had been
 William's. Each time his mother's heart was firm with pride and joy. He
 was started now. The studs she and the children had bought for William
 were in his shirt-front; he wore one of William's dress shirts. But he had
 an elegant figure. His face was rough, but warm-looking and rather
 pleasing. He did not look particularly a gentleman, but she thought he
 looked quite a man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He told her everything that took place, everything that was said. It was
 as if she had been there. And he was dying to introduce her to these new
 friends who had dinner at seven-thirty in the evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go along with you!" she said. "What do they want to know me for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They do!" he cried indignantly. "If they want to know me?and they
 say they do?then they want to know you, because you are quite as
 clever as I am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go along with you, child!" she laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she began to spare her hands. They, too, were work-gnarled now. The
 skin was shiny with so much hot water, the knuckles rather swollen. But
 she began to be careful to keep them out of soda. She regretted what they
 had been?so small and exquisite. And when Annie insisted on her
 having more stylish blouses to suit her age, she submitted. She even went
 so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her hair. Then she
 sniffed in her sarcastic manner, and was sure she looked a sight. But she
 looked a lady, Paul declared, as much as Mrs. Major Moreton, and far, far
 nicer. The family was coming on. Only Morel remained unchanged, or rather,
 lapsed slowly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul and his mother now had long discussions about life. Religion was
 fading into the background. He had shovelled away an the beliefs that
 would hamper him, had cleared the ground, and come more or less to the
 bedrock of belief that one should feel inside oneself for right and wrong,
 and should have the patience to gradually realise one's God. Now life
 interested him more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know," he said to his mother, "I don't want to belong to the
 well-to-do middle class. I like my common people best. I belong to the
 common people."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if anyone else said so, my son, wouldn't you be in a tear. YOU know
 you consider yourself equal to any gentleman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In myself," he answered, "not in my class or my education or my manners.
 But in myself I am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, then. Then why talk about the common people?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because?the difference between people isn't in their class, but in
 themselves. Only from the middle classes one gets ideas, and from the
 common people?life itself, warmth. You feel their hates and loves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's all very well, my boy. But, then, why don't you go and talk to your
 father's pals?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But they're rather different."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all. They're the common people. After all, whom do you mix with
 now?among the common people? Those that exchange ideas, like the
 middle classes. The rest don't interest you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But?there's the life?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't believe there's a jot more life from Miriam than you could get
 from any educated girl?say Miss Moreton. It is YOU who are snobbish
 about class."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She frankly WANTED him to climb into the middle classes, a thing not very
 difficult, she knew. And she wanted him in the end to marry a lady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now she began to combat him in his restless fretting. He still kept up his
 connection with Miriam, could neither break free nor go the whole length
 of engagement. And this indecision seemed to bleed him of his energy.
 Moreover, his mother suspected him of an unrecognised leaning towards
 Clara, and, since the latter was a married woman, she wished he would fall
 in love with one of the girls in a better station of life. But he was
 stupid, and would refuse to love or even to admire a girl much, just
 because she was his social superior.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My boy," said his mother to him, "all your cleverness, your breaking away
 from old things, and taking life in your own hands, doesn't seem to bring
 you much happiness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is happiness!" he cried. "It's nothing to me! How AM I to be happy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The plump question disturbed her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's for you to judge, my lad. But if you could meet some GOOD woman
 who would MAKE you happy?and you began to think of settling your
 life?when you have the means?so that you could work without
 all this fretting?it would be much better for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He frowned. His mother caught him on the raw of his wound of Miriam. He
 pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead, his eyes full of pain and fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean easy, mother," he cried. "That's a woman's whole doctrine for
 life?ease of soul and physical comfort. And I do despise it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, do you!" replied his mother. "And do you call yours a divine
 discontent?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I don't care about its divinity. But damn your happiness! So long as
 life's full, it doesn't matter whether it's happy or not. I'm afraid your
 happiness would bore me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You never give it a chance," she said. Then suddenly all her passion of
 grief over him broke out. "But it does matter!" she cried. "And you OUGHT
 to be happy, you ought to try to be happy, to live to be happy. How could
 I bear to think your life wouldn't be a happy one!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your own's been bad enough, mater, but it hasn't left you so much worse
 off than the folk who've been happier. I reckon you've done well. And I am
 the same. Aren't I well enough off?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're not, my son. Battle?battle?and suffer. It's about all
 you do, as far as I can see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why not, my dear? I tell you it's the best?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't. And one OUGHT to be happy, one OUGHT."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By this time Mrs. Morel was trembling violently. Struggles of this kind
 often took place between her and her son, when she seemed to fight for his
 very life against his own will to die. He took her in his arms. She was
 ill and pitiful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, Little," he murmured. "So long as you don't feel life's
 paltry and a miserable business, the rest doesn't matter, happiness or
 unhappiness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She pressed him to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I want you to be happy," she said pathetically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh, my dear?say rather you want me to live."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Morel felt as if her heart would break for him. At this rate she knew
 he would not live. He had that poignant carelessness about himself, his
 own suffering, his own life, which is a form of slow suicide. It almost
 broke her heart. With all the passion of her strong nature she hated
 Miriam for having in this subtle way undermined his joy. It did not matter
 to her that Miriam could not help it. Miriam did it, and she hated her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wished so much he would fall in love with a girl equal to be his mate?educated
 and strong. But he would not look at anybody above him in station. He
 seemed to like Mrs. Dawes. At any rate that feeling was wholesome. His
 mother prayed and prayed for him, that he might not be wasted. That was
 all her prayer?not for his soul or his righteousness, but that he
 might not be wasted. And while he slept, for hours and hours she thought
 and prayed for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drifted away from Miriam imperceptibly, without knowing he was going.
 Arthur only left the army to be married. The baby was born six months
 after his wedding. Mrs. Morel got him a job under the firm again, at
 twenty-one shillings a week. She furnished for him, with the help of
 Beatrice's mother, a little cottage of two rooms. He was caught now. It
 did not matter how he kicked and struggled, he was fast. For a time he
 chafed, was irritable with his young wife, who loved him; he went almost
 distracted when the baby, which was delicate, cried or gave trouble. He
 grumbled for hours to his mother. She only said: "Well, my lad, you did it
 yourself, now you must make the best of it." And then the grit came out in
 him. He buckled to work, undertook his responsibilities, acknowledged that
 he belonged to his wife and child, and did make a good best of it. He had
 never been very closely inbound into the family. Now he was gone
 altogether.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The months went slowly along. Paul had more or less got into connection
 with the Socialist, Suffragette, Unitarian people in Nottingham, owing to
 his acquaintance with Clara. One day a friend of his and of Clara's, in
 Bestwood, asked him to take a message to Mrs. Dawes. He went in the
 evening across Sneinton Market to Bluebell Hill. He found the house in a
 mean little street paved with granite cobbles and having causeways of dark
 blue, grooved bricks. The front door went up a step from off this rough
 pavement, where the feet of the passersby rasped and clattered. The brown
 paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed between the rents.
 He stood on the street below and knocked. There came a heavy footstep; a
 large, stout woman of about sixty towered above him. He looked up at her
 from the pavement. She had a rather severe face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She admitted him into the parlour, which opened on to the street. It was a
 small, stuffy, defunct room, of mahogany, and deathly enlargements of
 photographs of departed people done in carbon. Mrs. Radford left him. She
 was stately, almost martial. In a moment Clara appeared. She flushed
 deeply, and he was covered with confusion. It seemed as if she did not
 like being discovered in her home circumstances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought it couldn't be your voice," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. She invited him
 out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was a little, darkish room too, but it was smothered in white lace.
 The mother had seated herself again by the cupboard, and was drawing
 thread from a vast web of lace. A clump of fluff and ravelled cotton was
 at her right hand, a heap of three-quarter-inch lace lay on her left,
 whilst in front of her was the mountain of lace web, piling the hearthrug.
 Threads of curly cotton, pulled out from between the lengths of lace,
 strewed over the fender and the fireplace. Paul dared not go forward, for
 fear of treading on piles of white stuff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the table was a jenny for carding the lace. There was a pack of brown
 cardboard squares, a pack of cards of lace, a little box of pins, and on
 the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The room was all lace, and it was so dark and warm that the white, snowy
 stuff seemed the more distinct.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you're coming in you won't have to mind the work," said Mrs. Radford.
 "I know we're about blocked up. But sit you down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara, much embarrassed, gave him a chair against the wall opposite the
 white heaps. Then she herself took her place on the sofa, shamedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you drink a bottle of stout?" Mrs. Radford asked. "Clara, get him a
 bottle of stout."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He protested, but Mrs. Radford insisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You look as if you could do with it," she said. "Haven't you never any
 more colour than that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's only a thick skin I've got that doesn't show the blood through," he
 answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara, ashamed and chagrined, brought him a bottle of stout and a glass.
 He poured out some of the black stuff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, lifting the glass, "here's health!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And thank you," said Mrs. Radford.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a drink of stout.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And light yourself a cigarette, so long as you don't set the house on
 fire," said Mrs. Radford.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, you needn't thank me," she answered. "I s'll be glad to smell a bit
 of smoke in th' 'ouse again. A house o' women is as dead as a house wi' no
 fire, to my thinkin'. I'm not a spider as likes a corner to myself. I like
 a man about, if he's only something to snap at."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara began to work. Her jenny spun with a subdued buzz; the white lace
 hopped from between her fingers on to the card. It was filled; she snipped
 off the length, and pinned the end down to the banded lace. Then she put a
 new card in her jenny. Paul watched her. She sat square and magnificent.
 Her throat and arms were bare. The blood still mantled below her ears; she
 bent her head in shame of her humility. Her face was set on her work. Her
 arms were creamy and full of life beside the white lace; her large,
 well-kept hands worked with a balanced movement, as if nothing would hurry
 them. He, not knowing, watched her all the time. He saw the arch of her
 neck from the shoulder, as she bent her head; he saw the coil of dun hair;
 he watched her moving, gleaming arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've heard a bit about you from Clara," continued the mother. "You're in
 Jordan's, aren't you?" She drew her lace unceasing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, well, and I can remember when Thomas Jordan used to ask ME for one of
 my toffies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did he?" laughed Paul. "And did he get it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn't?which was latterly. For he's
 the sort that takes all and gives naught, he is?or used to be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think he's very decent," said Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; well, I'm glad to hear it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Radford looked across at him steadily. There was something determined
 about her that he liked. Her face was falling loose, but her eyes were
 calm, and there was something strong in her that made it seem she was not
 old; merely her wrinkles and loose cheeks were an anachronism. She had the
 strength and sang-froid of a woman in the prime of life. She continued
 drawing the lace with slow, dignified movements. The big web came up
 inevitably over her apron; the length of lace fell away at her side. Her
 arms were finely shapen, but glossy and yellow as old ivory. They had not
 the peculiar dull gleam that made Clara's so fascinating to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you've been going with Miriam Leivers?" the mother asked him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, she's a nice girl," she continued. "She's very nice, but she's a bit
 too much above this world to suit my fancy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is a bit like that," he agreed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She'll never be satisfied till she's got wings and can fly over
 everybody's head, she won't," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara broke in, and he told her his message. She spoke humbly to him. He
 had surprised her in her drudgery. To have her humble made him feel as if
 he were lifting his head in expectation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you like jennying?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What can a woman do!" she replied bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it sweated?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "More or less. Isn't ALL woman's work? That's another trick the men have
 played, since we force ourselves into the labour market."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now then, you shut up about the men," said her mother. "If the women
 wasn't fools, the men wouldn't be bad uns, that's what I say. No man was
 ever that bad wi' me but what he got it back again. Not but what they're a
 lousy lot, there's no denying it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But they're all right really, aren't they?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they're a bit different from women," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you care to be back at Jordan's?" he asked Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think so," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, she would!" cried her mother; "thank her stars if she could get
 back. Don't you listen to her. She's for ever on that 'igh horse of hers,
 an' it's back's that thin an' starved it'll cut her in two one of these
 days."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara suffered badly from her mother. Paul felt as if his eyes were coming
 very wide open. Wasn't he to take Clara's fulminations so seriously, after
 all? She spun steadily at her work. He experienced a thrill of joy,
 thinking she might need his help. She seemed denied and deprived of so
 much. And her arm moved mechanically, that should never have been subdued
 to a mechanism, and her head was bowed to the lace, that never should have
 been bowed. She seemed to be stranded there among the refuse that life has
 thrown away, doing her jennying. It was a bitter thing to her to be put
 aside by life, as if it had no use for her. No wonder she protested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came with him to the door. He stood below in the mean street, looking
 up at her. So fine she was in her stature and her bearing, she reminded
 him of Juno dethroned. As she stood in the doorway, she winced from the
 street, from her surroundings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you will go with Mrs. Hodgkisson to Hucknall?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was talking quite meaninglessly, only watching her. Her grey eyes at
 last met his. They looked dumb with humiliation, pleading with a kind of
 captive misery. He was shaken and at a loss. He had thought her high and
 mighty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he left her, he wanted to run. He went to the station in a sort of
 dream, and was at home without realising he had moved out of her street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had an idea that Susan, the overseer of the Spiral girls, was about to
 be married. He asked her the next day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say, Susan, I heard a whisper of your getting married. What about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Susan flushed red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's been talking to you?" she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody. I merely heard a whisper that you WERE thinking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I am, though you needn't tell anybody. What's more, I wish I
 wasn't!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, Susan, you won't make me believe that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shan't I? You CAN believe it, though. I'd rather stop here a thousand
 times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was perturbed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Susan?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl's colour was high, and her eyes flashed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's why!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And must you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For answer, she looked at him. There was about him a candour and
 gentleness which made the women trust him. He understood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, I'm sorry," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tears came to her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you'll see it'll turn out all right. You'll make the best of it," he
 continued rather wistfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's nothing else for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yea, there's making the worst of it. Try and make it all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He soon made occasion to call again on Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you," he said, "care to come back to Jordan's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She put down her work, laid her beautiful arms on the table, and looked at
 him for some moments without answering. Gradually the flush mounted her
 cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul felt rather awkward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, because Susan is thinking of leaving," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara went on with her jennying. The white lace leaped in little jumps and
 bounds on to the card. He waited for her. Without raising her head, she
 said at last, in a peculiar low voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you said anything about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Except to you, not a word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was again a long silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will apply when the advertisement is out," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will apply before that. I will let you know exactly when."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went on spinning her little machine, and did not contradict him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara came to Jordan's. Some of the older hands, Fanny among them,
 remembered her earlier rule, and cordially disliked the memory. Clara had
 always been "ikey", reserved, and superior. She had never mixed with the
 girls as one of themselves. If she had occasion to find fault, she did it
 coolly and with perfect politeness, which the defaulter felt to be a
 bigger insult than crassness. Towards Fanny, the poor, overstrung
 hunchback, Clara was unfailingly compassionate and gentle, as a result of
 which Fanny shed more bitter tears than ever the rough tongues of the
 other overseers had caused her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was something in Clara that Paul disliked, and much that piqued him.
 If she were about, he always watched her strong throat or her neck, upon
 which the blonde hair grew low and fluffy. There was a fine down, almost
 invisible, upon the skin of her face and arms, and when once he had
 perceived it, he saw it always.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he was at his work, painting in the afternoon, she would come and
 stand near to him, perfectly motionless. Then he felt her, though she
 neither spoke nor touched him. Although she stood a yard away he felt as
 if he were in contact with her. Then he could paint no more. He flung down
 the brushes, and turned to talk to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes she praised his work; sometimes she was critical and cold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are affected in that piece," she would say; and, as there was an
 element of truth in her condemnation, his blood boiled with anger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again: "What of this?" he would ask enthusiastically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm!" She made a small doubtful sound. "It doesn't interest me much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because you don't understand it," he retorted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then why ask me about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I thought you would understand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She would shrug her shoulders in scorn of his work. She maddened him. He
 was furious. Then he abused her, and went into passionate exposition of
 his stuff. This amused and stimulated her. But she never owned that she
 had been wrong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the ten years that she had belonged to the women's movement she had
 acquired a fair amount of education, and, having had some of Miriam's
 passion to be instructed, had taught herself French, and could read in
 that language with a struggle. She considered herself as a woman apart,
 and particularly apart, from her class. The girls in the Spiral department
 were all of good homes. It was a small, special industry, and had a
 certain distinction. There was an air of refinement in both rooms. But
 Clara was aloof also from her fellow-workers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 None of these things, however, did she reveal to Paul. She was not the one
 to give herself away. There was a sense of mystery about her. She was so
 reserved, he felt she had much to reserve. Her history was open on the
 surface, but its inner meaning was hidden from everybody. It was exciting.
 And then sometimes he caught her looking at him from under her brows with
 an almost furtive, sullen scrutiny, which made him move quickly. Often she
 met his eyes. But then her own were, as it were, covered over, revealing
 nothing. She gave him a little, lenient smile. She was to him
 extraordinarily provocative, because of the knowledge she seemed to
 possess, and gathered fruit of experience he could not attain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day he picked up a copy of <i>Lettres de mon Moulin</i> from her
 work-bench.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You read French, do you?" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clara glanced round negligently. She was making an elastic stocking of
 heliotrope silk, turning the Spiral machine with slow, balanced
 regularity, occasionally bending down to see her work or to adjust the
 needles; then her magnificent neck, with its down and fine pencils of
 hair, shone white against the lavender, lustrous silk. She turned a few
 more rounds, and stopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you say?" she asked, smiling sweetly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul's eyes glittered at her insolent indifference to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did not know you read French," he said, very polite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you not?" she replied, with a faint, sarcastic smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rotten swank!" he said, but scarcely loud enough to be heard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He shut his mouth angrily as he watched her. She seemed to scorn the work
 she mechanically produced; yet the hose she made were as nearly perfect as
 possible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't like Spiral work," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well, all work is work," she answered, as if she knew all about it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He marvelled at her coldness. He had to do everything hotly. She must be
 something special.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What would you prefer to do?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed at him indulgently, as she said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is so little likelihood of my ever being given a choice, that I
 haven't wasted time considering."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pah!" he said, contemptuous on his side now. "You only say that because
 you're too proud to own up what you want and can't get."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know me very well," she replied coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know you think you're terrific great shakes, and that you live under
 the eternal insult of working in a factory."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was very angry and very rude. She merely turned away from him in
 disdain. He walked whistling down the room, flirted and laughed with
 Hilda.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Later on he said to himself:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was I so impudent to Clara for?" He was rather annoyed with himself,
 at the same time glad. "Serve her right; she stinks with silent pride," he
 said to himself angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the afternoon he came down. There was a certain weight on his heart
 which he wanted to remove. He thought to do it by offering her chocolates.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have one?" he said. "I bought a handful to sweeten me up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To his great relief, she accepted. He sat on the work-bench beside her
 machine, twisting a piece of silk round his finger. She loved him for his
 quick, unexpected movements, like a young animal. His feet swung as he
 pondered. The sweets lay strewn on the bench. She bent over her machine,
 grinding rhythmically, then stooping to see the stocking that hung
 beneath, pulled down by the weight. He watched the handsome crouching of
 her back, and the apron-strings curling on the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is always about you," he said, "a sort of waiting. Whatever I see
 you doing, you're not really there: you are waiting?like Penelope
 when she did her weaving." He could not help a spurt of wickedness. "I'll
 call you Penelope," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would it make any difference?" she said, carefully removing one of her
 needles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That doesn't matter, so long as it pleases me. Here, I say, you seem to
 forget I'm your boss. It just occurs to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what does that mean?" she asked coolly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It means I've got a right to boss you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there anything you want to complain about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I say, you needn't be nasty," he said angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what you want," she said, continuing her task.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want you to treat me nicely and respectfully."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Call you 'sir', perhaps?" she asked quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, call me 'sir'. I should love it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I wish you would go upstairs, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mouth closed, and a frown came on his face. He jumped suddenly down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're too blessed superior for anything," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he went away to the other girls. He felt he was being angrier than he
 had any need to be. In fact, he doubted slightly that he was showing off.
 But if he were, then he would. Clara heard him laughing, in a way she
 hated, with the girls down the next room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When at evening he went through the department after the girls had gone,
 he saw his chocolates lying untouched in front of Clara's machine. He left
 them. In the morning they were still there, and Clara was at work. Later
 on Minnie, a little brunette they called Pussy, called to him:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, haven't you got a chocolate for anybody?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sorry, Pussy," he replied. "I meant to have offered them; then I went and
 forgot 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think you did," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll bring you some this afternoon. You don't want them after they've
 been lying about, do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'm not particular," smiled Pussy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no," he said. "They'll be dusty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went up to Clara's bench.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sorry I left these things littering about," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She flushed scarlet. He gathered them together in his fist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'll be dirty now," he said. "You should have taken them. I wonder why
 you didn't. I meant to have told you I wanted you to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He flung them out of the window into the yard below. He just glanced at
 her. She winced from his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the afternoon he brought another packet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you take some?" he said, offering them first to Clara. "These are
 fresh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She accepted one, and put it on to the bench.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, take several?for luck," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took a couple more, and put them on the bench also. Then she turned in
 confusion to her work. He went on up the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here you are, Pussy," he said. "Don't be greedy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are they all for her?" cried the others, rushing up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course they're not," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girls clamoured round. Pussy drew back from her mates.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come out!" she cried. "I can have first pick, can't I, Paul?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Be nice with 'em," he said, and went away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You ARE a dear," the girls cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tenpence," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went past Clara without speaking. She felt the three chocolate creams
 would burn her if she touched them. It needed all her courage to slip them
 into the pocket of her apron.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girls loved him and were afraid of him. He was so nice while he was
 nice, but if he were offended, so distant, treating them as if they
 scarcely existed, or not more than the bobbins of thread. And then, if
 they were impudent, he said quietly: "Do you mind going on with your
 work," and stood and watched.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he celebrated his twenty-third birthday, the house was in trouble.
 Arthur was just going to be married. His mother was not well. His father,
 getting an old man, and lame from his accidents, was given a paltry, poor
 job. Miriam was an eternal reproach. He felt he owed himself to her, yet
 could not give himself. The house, moreover, needed his support. He was
 pulled in all directions. He was not glad it was his birthday. It made him
 bitter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got to work at eight o'clock. Most of the clerks had not turned up. The
 girls were not due till 8.30. As he was changing his coat, he heard a
 voice behind him say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul, Paul, I want you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Fanny, the hunchback, standing at the top of her stairs, her face
 radiant with a secret. Paul looked at her in astonishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want you," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood, at a loss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on," she coaxed. "Come before you begin on the letters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went down the half-dozen steps into her dry, narrow, "finishing-off"
 room. Fanny walked before him: her black bodice was short?the waist
 was under her armpits?and her green-black cashmere skirt seemed very
 long, as she strode with big strides before the young man, himself so
 graceful. She went to her seat at the narrow end of the room, where the
 window opened on to chimney-pots. Paul watched her thin hands and her flat
 red wrists as she excitedly twitched her white apron, which was spread on
 the bench in front of her. She hesitated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You didn't think we'd forgot you?" she asked, reproachful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" he asked. He had forgotten his birthday himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Why,' he says! 'Why!' Why, look here!" She pointed to the calendar, and
 he saw, surrounding the big black number "21", hundreds of little crosses
 in black-lead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, kisses for my birthday," he laughed. "How did you know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you want to know, don't you?" Fanny mocked, hugely delighted.
 "There's one from everybody?except Lady Clara?and two from
 some. But I shan't tell you how many I put."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I know, you're spooney," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There you ARE mistaken!" she cried, indignant. "I could never be so
 soft." Her voice was strong and contralto.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You always pretend to be such a hard-hearted hussy," he laughed. "And you
 know you're as sentimental?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd rather be called sentimental than frozen meat," Fanny blurted. Paul
 knew she referred to Clara, and he smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you say such nasty things about me?" he laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my duck," the hunchback woman answered, lavishly tender. She was
 thirty-nine. "No, my duck, because you don't think yourself a fine figure
 in marble and us nothing but dirt. I'm as good as you, aren't I, Paul?"
 and the question delighted her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, we're not better than one another, are we?" he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I'm as good as you, aren't I, Paul?" she persisted daringly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course you are. If it comes to goodness, you're better."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was rather afraid of the situation. She might get hysterical.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought I'd get here before the others?won't they say I'm deep!
 Now shut your eyes?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And open your mouth, and see what God sends you," he continued, suiting
 action to words, and expecting a piece of chocolate. He heard the rustle
 of the apron, and a faint clink of metal. "I'm going to look," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He opened his eyes. Fanny, her long cheeks flushed, her blue eyes shining,
 was gazing at him. There was a little bundle of paint-tubes on the bench
 before him. He turned pale.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Fanny," he said quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "From us all," she answered hastily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, but?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are they the right sort?" she asked, rocking herself with delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jove! they're the best in the catalogue."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But they're the right sorts?" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're off the little list I'd made to get when my ship came in." He bit
 his lip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fanny was overcome with emotion. She must turn the conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They was all on thorns to do it; they all paid their shares, all except
 the Queen of Sheba."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Queen of Sheba was Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And wouldn't she join?" Paul asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She didn't get the chance; we never told her; we wasn't going to have HER
 bossing THIS show. We didn't WANT her to join."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul laughed at the woman. He was much moved. At last he must go. She was
 very close to him. Suddenly she flung her arms round his neck and kissed
 him vehemently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can give you a kiss to-day," she said apologetically. "You've looked so
 white, it's made my heart ache."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul kissed her, and left her. Her arms were so pitifully thin that his
 heart ached also.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That day he met Clara as he ran downstairs to wash his hands at
 dinner-time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have stayed to dinner!" he exclaimed. It was unusual for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; and I seem to have dined on old surgical-appliance stock. I MUST go
 out now, or I shall feel stale india-rubber right through."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She lingered. He instantly caught at her wish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are going anywhere?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went together up to the Castle. Outdoors she dressed very plainly,
 down to ugliness; indoors she always looked nice. She walked with
 hesitating steps alongside Paul, bowing and turning away from him. Dowdy
 in dress, and drooping, she showed to great disadvantage. He could
 scarcely recognise her strong form, that seemed to slumber with power. She
 appeared almost insignificant, drowning her stature in her stoop, as she
 shrank from the public gaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Castle grounds were very green and fresh. Climbing the precipitous
 ascent, he laughed and chattered, but she was silent, seeming to brood
 over something. There was scarcely time to go inside the squat, square
 building that crowns the bluff of rock. They leaned upon the wall where
 the cliff runs sheer down to the Park. Below them, in their holes in the
 sandstone, pigeons preened themselves and cooed softly. Away down upon the
 boulevard at the foot of the rock, tiny trees stood in their own pools of
 shadow, and tiny people went scurrying about in almost ludicrous
 importance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles, and have a
 handful of them," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed, answering:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us
 proportionately. The trees are much more significant."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bulk only," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed cynically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metals showed upon the
 railway-track, whose margin was crowded with little stacks of timber,
 beside which smoking toy engines fussed. Then the silver string of the
 canal lay at random among the black heaps. Beyond, the dwellings, very
 dense on the river flat, looked like black, poisonous herbage, in thick
 rows and crowded beds, stretching right away, broken now and then by
 taller plants, right to where the river glistened in a hieroglyph across
 the country. The steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny. Great
 stretches of country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with
 corn-land, spread towards the haze, where the hills rose blue beyond grey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is comforting," said Mrs. Dawes, "to think the town goes no farther.
 It is only a LITTLE sore upon the country yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A little scab," Paul said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She shivered. She loathed the town. Looking drearily across at the country
 which was forbidden her, her impassive face, pale and hostile, she
 reminded Paul of one of the bitter, remorseful angels.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the town's all right," he said; "it's only temporary. This is the
 crude, clumsy make-shift we've practised on, till we find out what the
 idea is. The town will come all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The pigeons in the pockets of rock, among the perched bushes, cooed
 comfortably. To the left the large church of St. Mary rose into space, to
 keep close company with the Castle, above the heaped rubble of the town.
 Mrs. Dawes smiled brightly as she looked across the country.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I feel better," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you," he replied. "Great compliment!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my brother!" she laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm! that's snatching back with the left hand what you gave with the
 right, and no mistake," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed in amusement at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what was the matter with you?" he asked. "I know you were brooding
 something special. I can see the stamp of it on your face yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I will not tell you," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, hug it," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She flushed and bit her lip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she said, "it was the girls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What about 'em?" Paul asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They have been plotting something for a week now, and to-day they seem
 particularly full of it. All alike; they insult me with their secrecy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do they?" he asked in concern.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should not mind," she went on, in the metallic, angry tone, "if they
 did not thrust it into my face?the fact that they have a secret."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just like women," said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is hateful, their mean gloating," she said intensely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul was silent. He knew what the girls gloated over. He was sorry to be
 the cause of this new dissension.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They can have all the secrets in the world," she went on, brooding
 bitterly; "but they might refrain from glorying in them, and making me
 feel more out of it than ever. It is?it is almost unbearable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul thought for a few minutes. He was much perturbed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will tell you what it's all about," he said, pale and nervous. "It's my
 birthday, and they've bought me a fine lot of paints, all the girls.
 They're jealous of you"?he felt her stiffen coldly at the word
 'jealous'?"merely because I sometimes bring you a book," he added
 slowly. "But, you see, it's only a trifle. Don't bother about it, will you?because"?he
 laughed quickly?"well, what would they say if they saw us here now,
 in spite of their victory?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was angry with him for his clumsy reference to their present intimacy.
 It was almost insolent of him. Yet he was so quiet, she forgave him,
 although it cost her an effort.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the Castle wall. He had
 inherited from his mother a fineness of mould, so that his hands were
 small and vigorous. Hers were large, to match her large limbs, but white
 and powerful looking. As Paul looked at them he knew her. "She is wanting
 somebody to take her hands?for all she is so contemptuous of us," he
 said to himself. And she saw nothing but his two hands, so warm and alive,
 which seemed to live for her. He was brooding now, staring out over the
 country from under sullen brows. The little, interesting diversity of
 shapes had vanished from the scene; all that remained was a vast, dark
 matrix of sorrow and tragedy, the same in all the houses and the
 river-flats and the people and the birds; they were only shapen
 differently. And now that the forms seemed to have melted away, there
 remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed, a dark mass
 of struggle and pain. The factory, the girls, his mother, the large,
 uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged into one atmosphere?dark,
 brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that two o'clock striking?" Mrs. Dawes said in surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paul started, and everything sprang into form, regained its individuality,
 its forgetfulness, and its cheerfulness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They hurried back to work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he was in the rush of preparing for the night's post, examining the
 work up from Fanny's room, which smelt of ironing, the evening postman
 came in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Mr. Paul Morel,'" he said, smiling, handing Paul a package. "A lady's
 handwriting! Don't let the girls see it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The postman, himself a favourite, was pleased to make fun of the girls'
 affection for Paul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a volume of verse with a brief note: "You will allow me to send you
 this, and so spare me my isolation. I also sympathise and wish you well.?C.D."
 Paul flushed hot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Lord! Mrs. Dawes. She can't afford it. Good Lord, who ever'd have
 thought it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was suddenly intensely moved. He was filled with the warmth of her. In
 the glow he could almost feel her as if she were present?her arms,
 her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This move on the part of Clara brought them into closer intimacy. The
 other girls noticed that when Paul met Mrs. Dawes his eyes lifted and gave
 that peculiar bright greeting which they could interpret. Knowing he was
 unaware, Clara made no sign, save that occasionally she turned aside her
 face from him when he came upon her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They walked out together very often at dinner-time; it was quite open,
 quite frank. Everybody seemed to feel that he was quite unaware of the
 state of his own feeling, and that nothing was wrong. He talked to her now
 with some of the old fervour with which he had talked to Miriam, but he
 cared less about the talk; he did not bother about his conclusions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day in October they went out to Lambley for tea. Suddenly they came to
 a halt on top of the hill. He climbed and sat on a gate, she sat on the
 stile. The afternoon was perfectly still, with a dim haze, and yellow
 sheaves glowing through. They were quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How old were you when you married?" he asked quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twenty-two."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her voice was subdued, almost submissive. She would tell him now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is eight years ago?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And when did you leave him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Three years ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Five years! Did you love him when you married him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was silent for some time; then she said slowly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought I did?more or less. I didn't think much about it. And he
 wanted me. I was very prudish then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you sort of walked into it without thinking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I seemed to have been asleep nearly all my life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Somnambule</i>? But?when did you wake up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know that I ever did, or ever have?since I was a child."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You went to sleep as you grew to be a woman? How queer! And he didn't
 wake you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; he never got there," she replied, in a monotone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The brown birds dashed over the hedges where the rose-hips stood naked and
 scarlet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got where?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At me. He never really mattered to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The afternoon was so gently warm and dim. Red roofs of the cottages burned
 among the blue haze. He loved the day. He could feel, but he could not
 understand, what Clara was saying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why did you leave him? Was he horrid to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She shuddered lightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He?he sort of degraded me. He wanted to bully me because he hadn't
 got me. And then I felt as if I wanted to run, as if I was fastened and
 bound up. And he seemed dirty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not at all see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And was he always dirty?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A bit," she replied slowly. "And then he seemed as if he couldn't get AT
 me, really. And then he got brutal?he WAS brutal!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why did you leave him finally?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because?because he was unfaithful to me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were both silent for some time. Her hand lay on the gate-post as she
 balanced. He put his own over it. His heart beat quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But did you?were you ever?did you ever give him a chance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chance? How?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To come near to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I married him?and I was willing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They both strove to keep their voices steady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I believe he loves you," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It looks like it," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wanted to take his hand away, and could not. She saved him by removing
 her own. After a silence, he began again:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you leave him out of count all along?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He left me," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I suppose he couldn't MAKE himself mean everything to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He tried to bully me into it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the conversation had got them both out of their depth. Suddenly Paul
 jumped down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on," he said. "Let's go and get some tea."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found a cottage, where they sat in the cold parlour. She poured out
 his tea. She was very quiet. He felt she had withdrawn again from him.
 After tea, she stared broodingly into her tea-cup, twisting her wedding
 ring all the time. In her abstraction she took the ring off her finger,
 stood it up, and spun it upon the table. The gold became a diaphanous,
 glittering globe. It fell, and the ring was quivering upon the table. She
 spun it again and again. Paul watched, fascinated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she was a married woman, and he believed in simple friendship. And he
 considered that he was perfectly honourable with regard to her. It was
 only a friendship between man and woman, such as any civilised persons
 might have.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was like so many young men of his own age. Sex had become so
 complicated in him that he would have denied that he ever could want Clara
 or Miriam or any woman whom he knew. Sex desire was a sort of detached
 thing, that did not belong to a woman. He loved Miriam with his soul. He
 grew warm at the thought of Clara, he battled with her, he knew the curves
 of her breast and shoulders as if they had been moulded inside him; and
 yet he did not positively desire her. He would have denied it for ever. He
 believed himself really bound to Miriam. If ever he should marry, some
 time in the far future, it would be his duty to marry Miriam. That he gave
 Clara to understand, and she said nothing, but left him to his courses. He
 came to her, Mrs. Dawes, whenever he could. Then he wrote frequently to
 Miriam, and visited the girl occasionally. So he went on through the
 winter; but he seemed not so fretted. His mother was easier about him. She
 thought he was getting away from Miriam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of Clara for him; but still
 she was certain that the best in him would triumph. His feeling for Mrs.
 Dawes?who, moreover, was a married woman?was shallow and
 temporal, compared with his love for herself. He would come back to her,
 she was sure; with some of his young freshness gone, perhaps, but cured of
 his desire for the lesser things which other women than herself could give
 him. She could bear all if he were inwardly true to her and must come
 back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw none of the anomaly of his position. Miriam was his old friend,
 lover, and she belonged to Bestwood and home and his youth. Clara was a
 newer friend, and she belonged to Nottingham, to life, to the world. It
 seemed to him quite plain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Dawes and he had many periods of coolness, when they saw little of
 each other; but they always came together again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Were you horrid with Baxter Dawes?" he asked her. It was a thing that
 seemed to trouble him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In what way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't know. But weren't you horrid with him? Didn't you do
 something that knocked him to pieces?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, pray?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Making him feel as if he were nothing?I know," Paul declared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are so clever, my friend," she said coolly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The conversation broke off there. But it made her cool with him for some
 time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She very rarely saw Miriam now. The friendship between the two women was
 not broken off, but considerably weakened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you come in to the concert on Sunday afternoon?" Clara asked him
 just after Christmas.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I promised to go up to Willey Farm," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't mind, do you?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why should I?" she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Which almost annoyed him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know," he said, "Miriam and I have been a lot to each other ever
 since I was sixteen?that's seven years now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a long time," Clara replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; but somehow she?it doesn't go right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How?" asked Clara.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She seems to draw me and draw me, and she wouldn't leave a single hair of
 me free to fall out and blow away?she'd keep it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you like to be kept."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he said, "I don't. I wish it could be normal, give and take?like
 me and you. I want a woman to keep me, but not in her pocket."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if you love her, it couldn't be normal, like me and you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; I should love her better then. She sort of wants me so much that I
 can't give myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wants you how?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wants the soul out of my body. I can't help shrinking back from her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And yet you love her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I don't love her. I never even kiss her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?" Clara asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose you're afraid," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not. Something in me shrinks from her like hell?she's so good,
 when I'm not good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you know what she is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do! I know she wants a sort of soul union."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how do you know what she wants?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've been with her for seven years."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you haven't found out the very first thing about her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That she doesn't want any of your soul communion. That's your own
 imagination. She wants you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pondered over this. Perhaps he was wrong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But she seems?" he began.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've never tried," she answered.

 CHAPTER XI
 </h2>
 <h3>
 THE TEST ON MIRIAM
 </h3>
 <p>
 WITH the spring came again the old madness and battle. Now he knew he
 would have to go to Miriam. But what was his reluctance? He told himself
 it was only a sort of overstrong virginity in her and him which neither
 could break through. He might have married her; but his circumstances at
 home made it difficult, and, moreover, he did not want to marry. Marriage
 was for life, and because they had become close companions, he and she, he
 did not see that it should inevitably follow they should be man and wife.
 He did not feel that he wanted marriage with Miriam. He wished he did. He
 would have given his head to have felt a joyous desire to marry her and to
 have her. Then why couldn't he bring it off? There was some obstacle; and
 what was the obstacle? It lay in the physical bondage. He shrank from the
 physical contact. But why? With her he felt bound up inside himself. He
 could not go out to her. Something struggled in him, but he could not get
 to her. Why? She loved him. Clara said she even wanted him; then why
 couldn't he go to her, make love to her, kiss her? Why, when she put her
 arm in his, timidly, a
