Johnson in the year 1759, when his age was fifty.&nbsp; He had
written his <i>London</i> in 1738; his <i>Vanity of Human
Wishes</i> in 1740; his <i>Rambler</i> between March, 1750, and
March, 1752.&nbsp; In 1755 his <i>Dictionary</i> had appeared,
and Dublin, by giving him its honorary LL.D., had enabled his
friends to call him ?Doctor? Johnson.&nbsp; His
friends were many, and his honour among men was great.&nbsp; He
owed them to his union of intellectual power with unflinching
probity.&nbsp; But he had worked hard, battling against the wolf
without, and the black dog within?poverty and
hypochondria.&nbsp; He was still poor, though his personal wants
did not exceed a hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; His wife had been
seven years dead, and he missed her sorely.&nbsp; His old mother,
who lived to the age of ninety, died poor in January of this
year, 1759.&nbsp; In her old age, Johnson had sought to help her
from his earnings.&nbsp; At her death there were some little
debts, and there were costs of burial.&nbsp; That he might earn
enough to pay them he wrote <i>Rasselas</i>.</p><br>
<p><i>Rasselas</i> was written in the evenings of one week, and
sent to press while being written.&nbsp; Johnson earned by it a
hundred pounds, with <span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>twenty-five pounds more for a second edition.&nbsp; It
was published in March or April; Johnson never read it after it
had been published until more than twenty years afterwards.&nbsp;
Then, finding it in a chaise with Boswell, he took it up and read
it eagerly.</p><br>
<p>This is one of Johnson?s letters to his mother, written
after he knew that her last illness had come upon her.&nbsp; It
is dated about ten days before her death.&nbsp; The
?Miss? referred to in it was a faithful friend.&nbsp;
?Miss? was his home name for an affectionate
step-daughter, Lucy Porter:?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>?<span class="smcap">Honoured
Madam</span>,?</p><br>
<p>?The account which Miss gives me of your health pierces
my heart.&nbsp; God comfort and preserve you, and save you, for
the sake of Jesus Christ.</p><br>
<p>?I would have Miss read to you from time to time the
Passion of our Saviour; and sometimes the sentences in the
Communion Service beginning??Come unto me, all ye
that travail and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.?</p><br>
<p>?I have just now read a physical book which inclines me
to think that a strong infusion of the bark would do you
good.&nbsp; Do, dear mother, try it.</p><br>
<p>?Pray, send me your blessing, and forgive all that I
have done amiss to you.&nbsp; And whatever you would have done,
and what debts you would have paid first, or anything else that
you would direct, let Miss put it down; I shall endeavour to obey
you.</p><br>
<p>?I have got twelve guineas to send you? [six were
borrowed.&nbsp; There was a note in Johnson?s Diary of six
guineas repaid to Allen, the printer, who had lent them when he
wanted to send money to his dying mother], ?but unhappily
<span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>am at a loss
how to send it to-night.&nbsp; If I cannot send it to-night, it
will come by the next post.</p><br>
<p>?Pray, do not omit anything mentioned in this
letter.&nbsp; God bless you for ever and ever.</p><br>

</blockquote>
<p>That is the personal side of the tale of
<i>Rasselas</i>.&nbsp; In that way Johnson suddenly, on urgent
pressure, carried out a design that had been in his mind.&nbsp;
The success of Eastern tales, written as a form of moral essay,
in the <i>Rambler</i> and <i>Adventurer</i>, upon suggestion, no
doubt, of Addison?s <i>Vision of Mirza</i>, had prompted
him to express his view of life more fully than in essay form by
way of Oriental apologue; and his early work on Father
Lobo?s Voyage to Abyssinia, caused him to choose Abyssinia
for the land in which to lay his fable.</p><br>
<p>But Johnson?s <i>Rasselas</i> has also a close relation
to the time when it was written, as Johnson himself had to the
time in which he lived.&nbsp; From the beginning of the
century?and especially, in England, since the beginning of
the reign of George the Second?there had been a growing
sense of the ills of life, associated in some minds with doubt
whether there could be a just God ruling this unhappy
world.&nbsp; Hard problems of humanity pressed more and more on
earnest minds.&nbsp; The feeling expressed in Johnson?s
<i>Vanity of Human </i><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>Wishes</i> had deepened everywhere
by the year 1759.&nbsp; This has intense expression in
<i>Rasselas</i>, where all the joys of life, without active use
of the energies of life, can give no joy; and where all uses of
the energies of men are for the attainment of ideals worthless or
delusive.&nbsp; This life was to Johnson, and to almost all the
earnest thinkers of his time, unhappy in itself?a
school-house where the rod was ever active.&nbsp; But in its
unhappiness Johnson found no power that could overthrow his
faith.&nbsp; To him this world was but a place of education for
the happiness that would be to the faithful in the world to
come.&nbsp; There was a great dread for him in the question, Who
shall be found faithful?&nbsp; But there was no doubt in his mind
that the happiness of man is to be found only beyond the
grave.&nbsp; This was a feeling spread through Europe in the
darkness gathering before the outburst of the storm of the great
French Revolution.&nbsp; Even Gray, in his <i>Ode on a Distant
Prospect of Eton College</i>, regarded Eton boys at their sports
as ?little victims,? unconscious of the doom of
miseries awaiting them in life.&nbsp; Thus Johnson?s
<i>Rasselas</i> is a book doubly typical.&nbsp; We have in it the
spirit of the writer when it best expressed the spirit of his
time.</p><br>

<h2><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I<br>
DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ye</span> who listen with credulity to the
whispers of fancy, and pursue with eagerness the phantoms of
hope; who expect that age will perform the promises of youth, and
that the deficiencies of the present day will be supplied by the
morrow, attend to the history of Rasselas, Prince of
Abyssinia.</p><br>
<p>Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty Emperor in whose
dominions the father of waters begins his course?whose
bounty pours down the streams of plenty, and scatters over the
world the harvests of Egypt.</p><br>
<p>According to the custom which has descended from age to age
among the monarchs of the torrid zone, Rasselas was confined in a
private palace, with the other sons and daughters of Abyssinian
royalty, till the order of succession should call him to the
throne.</p><br>
<p>The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined
for the residence of the Abyssinian princes was a spacious valley
in the kingdom of Amhara, surrounded on every side by mountains,
of which the summits overhang the middle part.&nbsp; The only
passage by which it could be entered was a cavern that passed
under a rock, of which it had long been disputed whether it was
the work of nature or of human industry.&nbsp; The outlet of the
cavern was concealed by a thick wood, and the mouth which opened
into the valley was closed with gates of iron, forged by the
artificers of ancient days, so massive that no man, without the
help of engines, could open or shut them.</p><br>
<p>From the mountains on every side rivulets descended that
filled all the valley with verdure and fertility, and formed a
lake in the middle, inhabited by fish of every species, and
frequented by every fowl whom nature has taught to dip the wing
in water.&nbsp; This lake discharged its superfluities by a
stream, which entered a dark cleft of the mountain on the
northern side, and fell with dreadful noise from precipice to
precipice till it was heard no more.</p><br>
<p>The sides of the mountains were covered with trees, the banks
of the brooks were diversified with flowers; every blast shook
spices from the rocks, and every month dropped fruits upon the
ground.&nbsp; All animals that bite the grass or browse the
shrubs, whether wild or tame, wandered in this extensive circuit,
secured from beasts of prey by the mountains which confined
them.&nbsp; On one part were flocks and herds feeding in the
pastures, on another all the beasts of chase frisking in the
lawns, the sprightly kid was bounding on the rocks, the subtle
monkey frolicking in the trees, and the solemn elephant reposing
in the shade.&nbsp; All the diversities of the world were brought
together, the blessings of nature were collected, and its evils
extracted and excluded.</p><br>
<p>The valley, wide and fruitful, supplied its inhabitants with
all the necessaries of life, and all delights and superfluities
were added at the annual visit which the Emperor paid his
children, when the iron gate was opened to the sound of music,
and during eight days every one that resided in the valley was
required to propose whatever might contribute to make seclusion
pleasant, to fill up the vacancies of attention, and lessen the
tediousness of time.&nbsp; Every desire was immediately
granted.&nbsp; All the artificers of pleasure were called to
gladden the festivity; the musicians exerted the power of
harmony, and the dancers showed their activity before the
princes, in hopes that they should pass their lives in blissful
captivity, to which those only were admitted whose performance
was thought able to add novelty to luxury.&nbsp; Such was the
appearance of security and delight which this retirement
afforded, that they to whom it was new always desired that it
might be perpetual; and as those on whom the iron gate had once
closed were never suffered to return, the effect of longer
experience could not be known.&nbsp; Thus every year produced new
scenes of delight, and new competitors for imprisonment.</p><br>
<p>The palace stood on an eminence, raised about thirty paces
above the surface of the lake.&nbsp; It was divided into many
squares or courts, built with greater or less magnificence
according to the rank of those for whom they were designed.&nbsp;
The roofs were turned into arches of massive stone, joined by a
cement that grew harder by time, and the building stood from
century to century, deriding the solstitial rains and equinoctial
hurricanes, without need of reparation.</p><br>
<p>This house, which was so large as to be fully known to none
but some ancient officers, who successively inherited the secrets
of the place, was built as if Suspicion herself had dictated the
plan.&nbsp; To every room there was an open and secret passage;
every square had a communication with the rest, either from the
upper storeys by private galleries, or by subterraneous passages
from the lower apartments.&nbsp; Many of the columns had
unsuspected cavities, in which a long race of monarchs had
deposited their treasures.&nbsp; They then closed up the opening
with marble, which was never to be removed but in the utmost
exigences of the kingdom, and recorded their accumulations in a
book, which was itself concealed in a tower, not entered but by
the Emperor, attended by the prince who stood next in
succession.</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>CHAPTER II<br>
THE DISCONTENT OF RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> the sons and daughters of
Abyssinia lived only to know the soft vicissitudes of pleasure
and repose, attended by all that were skilful to delight, and
gratified with whatever the senses can enjoy.&nbsp; They wandered
in gardens of fragrance, and slept in the fortresses of
security.&nbsp; Every art was practised to make them pleased with
their own condition.&nbsp; The sages who instructed them told
them of nothing but the miseries of public life, and described
all beyond the mountains as regions of calamity, where discord
was always racing, and where man preyed upon man.&nbsp; To
heighten their opinion of their own felicity, they were daily
entertained with songs, the subject of which was the Happy
Valley.&nbsp; Their appetites were excited by frequent
enumerations of different enjoyments, and revelry and merriment
were the business of every hour, from the dawn of morning to the
close of the evening.</p><br>
<p>These methods were generally successful; few of the princes
had ever wished to enlarge their bounds, but passed their lives
in full conviction that they had all within their reach that art
or nature could bestow, and pitied those whom nature had excluded
from this seat of tranquillity as the sport of chance and the
slaves of misery.</p><br>
<p>Thus they rose in the morning and lay down at night, pleased
with each other and with themselves, all but Rasselas, who, in
the twenty-sixth year of his age, began to withdraw himself from
the pastimes and assemblies, and to delight in solitary walks and
silent meditation.&nbsp; He often sat before tables covered with
luxury, and forgot to taste the dainties that were placed before
him; he rose abruptly in the midst of the song, and hastily
retired beyond the sound of music.&nbsp; His attendants observed
the change, and endeavoured to renew his love of pleasure.&nbsp;
He neglected their officiousness, repulsed their invitations, and
spent day after day on the banks of rivulets sheltered with
trees, where he sometimes listened to the birds in the branches,
sometimes observed the fish playing in the streams, and anon cast
his eyes upon the pastures and mountains filled with animals, of
which some were biting the herbage, and some sleeping among the
bushes.&nbsp; The singularity of his humour made him much
observed.&nbsp; One of the sages, in whose conversation he had
formerly delighted, followed him secretly, in hope of discovering
the cause of his disquiet.&nbsp; Rasselas, who knew not that any
one was near him, having for some time fixed his eyes upon the
goats that were browsing among the rocks, began to compare their
condition with his own.</p><br>
<p>?What,? said he, ?makes the difference
between man and all the rest of the animal creation?&nbsp; Every
beast that strays beside me has the same corporal necessities
with myself: he is hungry, and crops the grass; he is thirsty,
and drinks the stream; his thirst and hunger are appeased; he is
satisfied, and sleeps; he rises again, and is hungry; he is again
fed, and is at rest.&nbsp; I am hungry and thirsty, like him, but
when thirst and hunger cease, I am not at rest.&nbsp; I am, like
him, pained with want, but am not, like him, satisfied with
fulness.&nbsp; The intermediate hours are tedious and gloomy; I
long again to be hungry that I may again quicken the
attention.&nbsp; The birds peck the berries or the corn, and fly
away to the groves, where they sit in seeming happiness on the
branches, and waste their lives in tuning one unvaried series of
sounds.&nbsp; I likewise can call the lutist and the singer; but
the sounds that pleased me yesterday weary me to-day, and will
grow yet more wearisome to-morrow.&nbsp; I can discover in me no
power of perception which is not glutted with its proper
pleasure, yet I do not feel myself delighted.&nbsp; Man surely
has some latent sense for which this place affords no
gratification; or he has some desire distinct from sense, which
must be satisfied before he can be happy.?</p><br>
<p>After this he lifted up his head, and seeing the moon rising,
walked towards the palace.&nbsp; As he passed through the fields,
and saw the animals around him, ?Ye,? said he,
?are happy, and need not envy me that walk thus among you,
burdened with myself; nor do I, ye gentle beings, envy your
felicity; for it is not the felicity of man.&nbsp; I have many
distresses from which you are free; I fear pain when I do not
feel it; I sometimes shrink at evils recollected, and sometimes
start at evils anticipated: surely the equity of Providence has
balanced peculiar sufferings with peculiar enjoyments.?</p><br>
<p>With observations like these the Prince amused himself as he
returned, uttering them with a plaintive voice, yet with a look
that discovered him to feel some complacence in his own
perspicacity, and to receive some solace of the miseries of life
from consciousness of the delicacy with which he felt and the
eloquence with which he bewailed them.&nbsp; He mingled
cheerfully in the diversions of the evening, and all rejoiced to
find that his heart was lightened.</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHAPTER III<br>
THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next day, his old
instructor, imagining that he had now made himself acquainted
with his disease of mind, was in hope of curing it by counsel,
and officiously sought an opportunity of conference, which the
Prince, having long considered him as one whose intellects were
exhausted, was not very willing to afford.&nbsp;
?Why,? said he, ?does this man thus intrude
upon me?&nbsp; Shall I never be suffered to forget these
lectures, which pleased only while they were new, and to become
new again must be forgotten??&nbsp; He then walked into the
wood, and composed himself to his usual meditations; when, before
his thoughts had taken any settled form, he perceived his pursuer
at his side, and was at first prompted by his impatience to go
hastily away; but being unwilling to offend a man whom he had
once reverenced and still loved, he invited him to sit down with
him on the bank.</p><br>
<p>The old man, thus encouraged, began to lament the change which
had been lately observed in the Prince, and to inquire why he so
often retired from the pleasures of the palace to loneliness and
silence.&nbsp; ?I fly from pleasure,? said the
Prince, ?because pleasure has ceased to please: I am lonely
because I am miserable, and am unwilling to cloud with my
presence the happiness of others.?&nbsp; ?You,
sir,? said the sage, ?are the first who has
complained of misery in the Happy Valley.&nbsp; I hope to
convince you that your complaints have no real cause.&nbsp; You
are here in full possession of all the Emperor of Abyssinia can
bestow; here is neither labour to be endured nor danger to be
dreaded, yet here is all that labour or danger can procure or
purchase.&nbsp; Look round and tell me which of your wants is
without supply: if you want nothing, how are you
unhappy??</p><br>
<p>?That I want nothing,? said the Prince, ?or
that I know not what I want, is the cause of my complaint: if I
had any known want, I should have a certain wish; that wish would
excite endeavour, and I should not then repine to see the sun
move so slowly towards the western mountains, or to lament when
the day breaks, and sleep will no longer hide me from
myself.&nbsp; When I see the kids and the lambs chasing one
another, I fancy that I should be happy if I had something to
pursue.&nbsp; But, possessing all that I can want, I find one day
and one hour exactly like another, except that the latter is
still more tedious than the former.&nbsp; Let your experience
inform me how the day may now seem as short as in my childhood,
while nature was yet fresh, and every moment showed me what I
never had observed before.&nbsp; I have already enjoyed too much:
give me something to desire.?&nbsp; The old man was
surprised at this new species of affliction, and knew not what to
reply, yet was unwilling to be silent.&nbsp; ?Sir,?
said he, ?if you had seen the miseries of the world, you
would know how to value your present state.?&nbsp;
?Now,? said the Prince, ?you have given me
something to desire.&nbsp; I shall long to see the miseries of
the world, since the sight of them is necessary to
happiness.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>CHAPTER IV<br>
THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this time the sound of music
proclaimed the hour of repast, and the conversation was
concluded.&nbsp; The old man went away sufficiently discontented
to find that his reasonings had produced the only conclusion
which they were intended to prevent.&nbsp; But in the decline of
life, shame and grief are of short duration: whether it be that
we bear easily what we have borne long; or that, finding
ourselves in age less regarded, we less regard others; or that we
look with slight regard upon afflictions to which we know that
the hand of death is about to put an end.</p><br>
<p>The Prince, whose views were extended to a wider space, could
not speedily quiet his emotions.&nbsp; He had been before
terrified at the length of life which nature promised him,
because he considered that in a long time much must be endured:
he now rejoiced in his youth, because in many years much might be
done.&nbsp; The first beam of hope that had been ever darted into
his mind rekindled youth in his cheeks, and doubled the lustre of
his eyes.&nbsp; He was fired with the desire of doing something,
though he knew not yet, with distinctness, either end or
means.&nbsp; He was now no longer gloomy and unsocial; but
considering himself as master of a secret stock of happiness,
which he could only enjoy by concealing it, he affected to be
busy in all the schemes of diversion, and endeavoured to make
others pleased with the state of which he himself was
weary.&nbsp; But pleasures can never be so multiplied or
continued as not to leave much of life unemployed; there were
many hours, both of the night and day, which he could spend
without suspicion in solitary thought.&nbsp; The load of life was
much lightened; he went eagerly into the assemblies, because he
supposed the frequency of his presence necessary to the success
of his purposes; he retired gladly to privacy, because he had now
a subject of thought.&nbsp; His chief amusement was to picture to
himself that world which he had never seen, to place himself in
various conditions, to be entangled in imaginary difficulties,
and to be engaged in wild adventures; but, his benevolence always
terminated his projects in the relief of distress, the detection
of fraud, the defeat of oppression, and the diffusion of
happiness.</p><br>
<p>Thus passed twenty months of the life of Rasselas.&nbsp; He
busied himself so intensely in visionary bustle that he forgot
his real solitude; and amidst hourly preparations for the various
incidents of human affairs, neglected to consider by what means
he should mingle with mankind.</p><br>
<p>One day, as he was sitting on a bank, he feigned to himself an
orphan virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous
lover, and crying after him for restitution.&nbsp; So strongly
was the image impressed upon his mind that he started up in the
maid?s defence, and ran forward to seize the plunderer with
all the eagerness of real pursuit.&nbsp; Fear naturally quickens
the flight of guilt.&nbsp; Rasselas could not catch the fugitive
with his utmost efforts; but, resolving to weary by perseverance
him whom he could not surpass in speed, he pressed on till the
foot of the mountain stopped his course.</p><br>
<p>Here he recollected himself, and smiled at his own useless
impetuosity.&nbsp; Then raising his eyes to the mountain,
?This,? said he, ?is the fatal obstacle that
hinders at once the enjoyment of pleasure and the exercise of
virtue.&nbsp; How long is it that my hopes and wishes have flown
beyond this boundary of my life, which yet I never have attempted
to surmount??</p><br>
<p>Struck with this reflection, he sat down to muse, and
remembered that since he first resolved to escape from his
confinement, the sun had passed twice over him in his annual
course.&nbsp; He now felt a degree of regret with which he had
never been before acquainted.&nbsp; He considered how much might
have been done in the time which had passed, and left nothing
real behind it.&nbsp; He compared twenty months with the life of
man.&nbsp; ?In life,? said he, ?is not to be
counted the ignorance of infancy or imbecility of age.&nbsp; We
are long before we are able to think, and we soon cease from the
power of acting.&nbsp; The true period of human existence may be
reasonably estimated at forty years, of which I have mused away
the four-and-twentieth part.&nbsp; What I have lost was certain,
for I have certainly possessed it; but of twenty months to come,
who can assure me??</p><br>
<p>The consciousness of his own folly pierced him deeply, and he
was long before he could be reconciled to himself.&nbsp;
?The rest of my time,? said he, ?has been lost
by the crime or folly of my ancestors, and the absurd
institutions of my country; I remember it with disgust, yet
without remorse: but the months that have passed since new light
darted into my soul, since I formed a scheme of reasonable
felicity, have been squandered by my own fault.&nbsp; I have lost
that which can never be restored; I have seen the sun rise and
set for twenty months, an idle gazer on the light of heaven; in
this time the birds have left the nest of their mother, and
committed themselves to the woods and to the skies; the kid has
forsaken the teat, and learned by degrees to climb the rocks in
quest of independent sustenance.&nbsp; I only have made no
advances, but am still helpless and ignorant.&nbsp; The moon, by
more than twenty changes, admonished me of the flux of life; the
stream that rolled before my feet upbraided my inactivity.&nbsp;
I sat feasting on intellectual luxury, regardless alike of the
examples of the earth and the instructions of the planets.&nbsp;
Twenty months are passed: who shall restore them??</p><br>
<p>These sorrowful meditations fastened upon his mind; he passed
four months in resolving to lose no more time in idle resolves,
and was awakened to more vigorous exertion by hearing a maid, who
had broken a porcelain cup, remark that what cannot be repaired
is not to be regretted.</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>This
was obvious; and Rasselas reproached himself that he had not
discovered it?having not known, or not considered, how many
useful hints are obtained by chance, and how often the mind,
hurried by her own ardour to distant views, neglects the truths
that lie open before her.&nbsp; He for a few hours regretted his
regret, and from that time bent his whole mind upon the means of
escaping from the Valley of Happiness.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br>
THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> now found that it would be very
difficult to effect that which it was very easy to suppose
effected.&nbsp; When he looked round about him, he saw himself
confined by the bars of nature, which had never yet been broken,
and by the gate through which none that had once passed it were
ever able to return.&nbsp; He was now impatient as an eagle in a
grate.&nbsp; He passed week after week in clambering the
mountains to see if there was any aperture which the bushes might
conceal, but found all the summits inaccessible by their
prominence.&nbsp; The iron gate he despaired to open for it was
not only secured with all the power of art, but was always
watched by successive sentinels, and was, by its position,
exposed to the perpetual observation of all the inhabitants.</p><br>
<p>He then examined the cavern through which the waters of the
lake were discharged; and, looking down at a time when the sun
shone strongly upon its mouth, he discovered it to be full of
broken rocks, which, though they permitted the stream to flow
through many narrow passages, would stop any body of solid
bulk.&nbsp; He returned discouraged and dejected; but having now
known the blessing of hope, resolved never to despair.</p><br>
<p>In these fruitless researches he spent ten months.&nbsp; The
time, however, passed cheerfully away?in the morning he
rose with new hope; in the evening applauded his own diligence;
and in the night slept soundly after his fatigue.&nbsp; He met a
thousand amusements, which beguiled his labour and diversified
his thoughts.&nbsp; He discerned the various instincts of animals
and properties of plants, and found the place replete with
wonders, of which he proposed to solace himself with the
contemplation if he should never be able to accomplish his
flight?rejoicing that his endeavours, though yet
unsuccessful, had supplied him with a source of inexhaustible
inquiry.&nbsp; <span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>But his original curiosity was not yet abated; he
resolved to obtain some knowledge of the ways of men.&nbsp; His
wish still continued, but his hope grew less.&nbsp; He ceased to
survey any longer the walls of his prison, and spared to search
by new toils for interstices which he knew could not be found,
yet determined to keep his design always in view, and lay hold on
any expedient that time should offer.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br>
A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the artists that had been
allured into the Happy Valley, to labour for the accommodation
and pleasure of its inhabitants, was a man eminent for his
knowledge of the mechanic powers, who had contrived many engines
both of use and recreation.&nbsp; By a wheel which the stream
turned he forced the water into a tower, whence it was
distributed to all the apartments of the palace.&nbsp; He erected
a pavilion in the garden, around which he kept the air always
cool by artificial showers.&nbsp; One of the groves, appropriated
to the ladies, was ventilated by fans, to which the rivulets that
ran through it gave a constant motion; and instruments of soft
music were played at proper distances, of which some played by
the impulse of the wind, and some by the power of the stream.</p><br>
<p>This artist was sometimes visited by Rasselas who was pleased
with every kind of knowledge, imagining that the time would come
when all his acquisitions should be of use to him in the open
world.&nbsp; He came one day to amuse himself in his usual
manner, and found the master busy in building a sailing
chariot.&nbsp; He saw that the design was practicable upon a
level surface, and with expressions of great esteem solicited its
completion.&nbsp; The workman was pleased to find himself so much
regarded by the Prince, and resolved to gain yet higher
honours.&nbsp; ?Sir,? said he, ?you have seen
but a small part of what the mechanic sciences can perform.&nbsp;
I have been long of opinion that, instead of the tardy conveyance
of ships and chariots, man might use the swifter migration of
wings, that the fields of air are open to knowledge, and that
only ignorance and idleness need crawl upon the
ground.?</p><br>
<p>This hint rekindled the Prince?s desire of passing the
mountains.&nbsp; Having seen what the mechanist had already
performed, he was willing to fancy that he could do more, yet
resolved to inquire further before he suffered hope to afflict
him by disappointment.&nbsp; ?I am afraid,? said he
to the artist, ?that your imagination prevails over your
skill, and that you now tell me rather what you wish than what
you know.&nbsp; Every animal has his element assigned him; the
birds have the air, and man and beasts the earth.?&nbsp;
?So,? replied the mechanist, ?fishes have the
water, in which yet beasts can swim by nature and man by
art.&nbsp; He that can swim needs not despair to fly; to swim is
to fly in a grosser fluid, and to fly is to swim in a
subtler.&nbsp; We are only to proportion our power of resistance
to the different density of matter through which we are to
pass.&nbsp; You will be necessarily up-borne by the air if you
can renew any impulse upon it faster than the air can recede from
the pressure.?</p><br>
<p>?But the exercise of swimming,? said the Prince,
?is very laborious; the strongest limbs are soon
wearied.&nbsp; I am afraid the act of flying will be yet more
violent; and wings will be of no great use unless we can fly
further than we can swim.?</p><br>
<p>?The labour of rising from the ground,? said the
artist, ?will be great, as we see it in the heavier
domestic fowls; but as we mount higher the earth?s
attraction and the body?s gravity will be gradually
diminished, till we shall arrive at a region where the man shall
float in the air without any tendency to fall; no care will then
be necessary but to move forward, which the gentlest impulse will
effect.&nbsp; You, sir, whose curiosity is so extensive, will
easily conceive with what pleasure a philosopher, furnished with
wings and hovering in the sky, would see the earth and all its
inhabitants rolling beneath him, and presenting to him
successively, by its diurnal motion, all the countries within the
same parallel.&nbsp; How must it amuse the pendent spectator to
see the moving scene of land and ocean, cities and deserts; to
survey with equal security the marts of trade and the fields of
battle; mountains infested by barbarians, and fruitful regions
gladdened by plenty and lulled by peace.&nbsp; How easily shall
we then trace the Nile through all his passages, pass over to
distant regions, and examine the face of nature from one
extremity of the earth to the other.?</p><br>
<p>?All this,? said the Prince, ?is much to be
desired, but I am afraid that no man will be able to breathe in
these regions of speculation and tranquillity.&nbsp; I have been
told that respiration is difficult upon lofty mountains, yet from
these precipices, though so high as to produce great tenuity of
air, it is very easy to fall; therefore I suspect that from any
height where life can be supported, there may be danger of too
quick descent.?</p><br>
<p>?Nothing,? replied the artist, ?will ever be
attempted if all possible objections must be first
overcome.&nbsp; If you will favour my project, I will try the
first flight at my own hazard.&nbsp; I have considered the
structure of all volant animals, and find the folding continuity
of the bat?s wings most easily accommodated to the human
form.&nbsp; Upon this model I shall begin my task to-morrow, and
in a year expect to tower into the air beyond the malice and
pursuit of man.&nbsp; But I will work only on this condition,
that the art shall not be divulged, and that you shall not
require me to make wings for any but ourselves.?</p><br>
<p>?Why,? said Rasselas, ?should you envy
others so great an advantage?&nbsp; All skill ought to be exerted
for universal good; every man has owed much to others, and ought
to repay the kindness that he has received.?</p><br>
<p>?If men were all virtuous,? returned the artist,
?I should with great alacrity teach them to fly.&nbsp; But
what would be the security of the good if the bad could at
pleasure invade them from the sky?&nbsp; Against an army sailing
through the clouds neither walls, mountains, nor seas could
afford security.&nbsp; A flight of northern savages might hover
in the wind and light with irresistible violence upon the capital
of a fruitful reason.&nbsp; Even this valley, the retreat of
princes, the abode of happiness, might be violated by the sudden
descent of some of the naked nations that swarm on the coast of
the southern sea!?</p><br>
<p>The Prince promised secrecy, and waited for the performance,
not wholly hopeless of success.&nbsp; He visited the work from
time to time, observed its progress, and remarked many ingenious
contrivances to facilitate motion and unite levity with
strength.&nbsp; The artist was every day more certain that he
should leave vultures and eagles behind him, and the contagion of
his confidence seized upon the Prince.&nbsp; In a year the wings
were finished; and on a morning appointed the maker appeared,
furnished for flight, on a little promontory; he waved his
pinions awhile to gather air, then leaped from his stand, and in
an instant dropped into the lake.&nbsp; His wings, which were of
no use in the air, sustained him in the water; and the Prince
drew him to land half dead with terror and vexation.</p><br>

THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince was not much afflicted
by this disaster, having suffered himself to hope for a happier
event only because he had no other means of escape in view.&nbsp;
He still persisted in his design to leave the Happy Valley by the
first opportunity.</p><br>
<p>His imagination was now at a stand; he had no prospect of
entering into the world, and, notwithstanding all his endeavours
to support himself, discontent by degrees preyed upon him, and he
began again to lose his thoughts in sadness when the rainy
season, which in these countries is periodical, made it
inconvenient to wander in the woods.</p><br>
<p>The rain continued longer and with more violence than had ever
been known; the clouds broke on the surrounding mountains, and
the torrents streamed into the plain on every side, till the
cavern was too narrow to discharge the water.&nbsp; The lake
overflowed its banks, and all the level of the valley was covered
with the inundation.&nbsp; The eminence on which the palace was
built, and some other spots of rising ground, were all that the
eye could now discover.&nbsp; The herds and flocks left the
pasture, and both the wild beasts and the tame retreated to the
mountains.</p><br>
<p>This inundation confined all the princes to domestic
amusements, and the attention of Rasselas was particularly seized
by a poem (which Imlac rehearsed) upon the various conditions of
humanity.&nbsp; He commanded the poet to attend him in his
apartment, and recite his verses a second time; then entering
into familiar talk, he thought himself happy in having found a
man who knew the world so well, and could so skilfully paint the
scenes of life.&nbsp; He asked a thousand questions about things
to which, though common to all other mortals, his confinement
from childhood had kept him a stranger.&nbsp; The poet pitied his
ignorance, and loved his curiosity, and entertained him from day
to day with novelty and instruction so that the Prince regretted
the necessity of sleep, and longed till the morning should renew
his pleasure.</p><br>
<p>As they were sitting together, the Prince commanded Imlac to
relate his history, and to tell by what accident he was forced,
or by what motive induced, to close his life in the Happy
Valley.&nbsp; As he was going to begin his narrative, Rasselas
was called to a concert, and obliged to restrain his curiosity
till the evening.</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>CHAPTER VIII<br>
THE HISTORY OF IMLAC.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> close of the day is, in the
regions of the torrid zone, the only season of diversion and
entertainment, and it was therefore midnight before the music
ceased and the princesses retired.&nbsp; Rasselas then called for
his companion, and required him to begin the story of his
life.</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? said Imlac, ?my history will not be
long: the life that is devoted to knowledge passes silently away,
and is very little diversified by events.&nbsp; To talk in
public, to think in solitude, to read and to hear, to inquire and
answer inquiries, is the business of a scholar.&nbsp; He wanders
about the world without pomp or terror, and is neither known nor
valued but by men like himself.</p><br>
<p>?I was born in the kingdom of Goiama, at no great
distance from the fountain of the Nile.&nbsp; My father was a
wealthy merchant, who traded between the inland countries of
Africa and the ports of the Red Sea.&nbsp; He was honest, frugal,
and diligent, but of mean sentiments and narrow comprehension; he
desired only to be rich, and to conceal his riches, lest he
should be spoiled by the governors of the province.?</p><br>
<p>?Surely,? said the Prince, ?my father must
be negligent of his charge if any man in his dominions dares take
that which belongs to another.&nbsp; Does he not know that kings
are accountable for injustice permitted as well as done?&nbsp; If
I were Emperor, not the meanest of my subjects should he
oppressed with impunity.&nbsp; My blood boils when I am told that
a merchant durst not enjoy his honest gains for fear of losing
them by the rapacity of power.&nbsp; Name the governor who robbed
the people that I may declare his crimes to the
Emperor!?</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? said Imlac, ?your ardour is the
natural effect of virtue animated by youth.&nbsp; The time will
come when you will acquit your father, and perhaps hear with less
impatience of the governor.&nbsp; Oppression is, in the
Abyssinian dominions, neither frequent nor tolerated; but no form
of government has been yet discovered by which cruelty can be
wholly prevented.&nbsp; Subordination supposes power on one part
and subjection on the other; and if power be in the hands of men
it will sometimes be abused.&nbsp; The vigilance of the supreme
magistrate may do much, but much will still remain undone.&nbsp;
He can never know all the crimes that are committed, and can
seldom punish all that he knows.?</p><br>
<p>?This,? said the Prince, ?I do not
understand; but I had rather hear thee than dispute.&nbsp;
Continue thy narration.?</p><br>
<p>?My father,? proceeded Imlac, ?originally
intended that I should have no other education than such as might
qualify me for commerce; and discovering in me great strength of
memory and quickness of apprehension, often declared his hope
that I should be some time the richest man in
Abyssinia.?</p><br>
<p>?Why,? said the Prince, ?did thy father
desire the increase of his wealth when it was already greater
than he durst discover or enjoy?&nbsp; I am unwilling to doubt
thy veracity, yet inconsistencies cannot both be true.?</p><br>
<p>?Inconsistencies,? answered Imlac, ?cannot
both be right; but, imputed to man, they may both be true.&nbsp;
Yet diversity is not inconsistency.&nbsp; My father might expect
a time of greater security.&nbsp; However, some desire is
necessary to keep life in motion; and he whose real wants are
supplied must admit those of fancy.?</p><br>
<p>?This,? said the Prince, ?I can in some
measure conceive.&nbsp; I repent that I interrupted
thee.?</p><br>
<p>?With this hope,? proceeded Imlac, ?he sent
me to school.&nbsp; But when I had once found the delight of
knowledge, and felt the pleasure of intelligence and the pride of
invention, I began silently to despise riches, and determined to
disappoint the purposes of my father, whose grossness of
conception raised my pity.&nbsp; I was twenty years old before
his tenderness would expose me to the fatigue of travel; in which
time I had been instructed, by successive masters, in all the
literature of my native country.&nbsp; As every hour taught me
something new, I lived in a continual course of gratification;
but as I advanced towards manhood, I lost much of the reverence
with which I had been used to look on my instructors; because
when the lessons were ended I did not find them wiser or better
than common men.</p><br>
<p>?At length my father resolved to initiate me in
commerce; and, opening one of his subterranean treasuries,
counted out ten thousand pieces of gold.&nbsp; ?This, young
man,? said he, ?is the stock with which you must
negotiate.&nbsp; I began with less than a fifth part, and you see
how diligence and parsimony have increased it.&nbsp; This is your
own, to waste or improve.&nbsp; If you squander it by negligence
or caprice, you must wait for my death before you will be rich;
if in four years you double your stock, we will thenceforward let
subordination cease, and live together as friends and partners,
for he shall be always equal with me who is equally skilled in
the art of growing rich.?</p><br>
<p>?We laid out our money upon camels, concealed in bales
of cheap goods, and travelled to the shore of the Red Sea.&nbsp;
When I cast my eye on the expanse of waters, my heart bounded
like that of a prisoner escaped.&nbsp; I felt an inextinguishable
curiosity kindle in my mind, and resolved to snatch this
opportunity of seeing the manners of other nations, and of
learning sciences unknown in Abyssinia.</p><br>
<p>?I remembered that my father had obliged me to the
improvement of my stock, not by a promise, which I ought not to
violate, but by a penalty, which I was at liberty to incur; and
therefore determined to gratify my predominant desire, and, by
drinking at the fountain of knowledge, to quench the thirst of
curiosity.</p><br>
<p>?As I was supposed to trade without connection with my
father, it was easy for me to become acquainted with the master
of a ship, and procure a passage to some other country.&nbsp; I
had no motives of choice to regulate my voyage.&nbsp; It was
sufficient <span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>for me that, wherever I wandered, I should see a country
which I had not seen before.&nbsp; I therefore entered a ship
bound for Surat, having left a letter for my father declaring my
intention.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br>
THE HISTORY OF IMLAC (<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">When</span> I first entered upon
the world of waters, and lost sight of land, I looked round about
me in pleasing terror, and thinking my soul enlarged by the
boundless prospect, imagined that I could gaze around me for ever
without satiety; but in a short time I grew weary of looking on
barren uniformity, where I could only see again what I had
already seen.&nbsp; I then descended into the ship, and doubted
for awhile whether all my future pleasures would not end, like
this, in disgust and disappointment.&nbsp; ?Yet
surely,? said I, ?the ocean and the land are very
different.&nbsp; The only variety of water is rest and
motion.&nbsp; But the earth has mountains and valleys, deserts
and cities; it is inhabited by men of different customs and
contrary opinions; and I may hope to find variety in life, though
I should miss it in nature.?</p><br>
<p>?With this thought I quieted my mind, and amused myself
during the voyage, sometimes by learning from the sailors the art
of navigation, which I have never practised, and sometimes by
forming schemes for my conduct in different situations, in not
one of which I have been ever placed.</p><br>
<p>?I was almost weary of my naval amusements when we
safely landed at Surat.&nbsp; I secured my money and, purchasing
some commodities for show, joined myself to a caravan that was
passing into the inland country.&nbsp; My companions, for some
reason or other, conjecturing that I was rich, and, by my
inquiries and admiration, finding that I was ignorant, considered
me as a novice whom they had a right to cheat, and who was to
learn, at the usual expense, the art of fraud.&nbsp; They exposed
me to the theft of servants and the exaction of officers, and saw
me plundered upon false pretences, without any advantage to
themselves but that of rejoicing in the superiority of their own
knowledge.?</p><br>
<p>?Stop a moment,? said the Prince; ?is there
such depravity in man as that he should injure another without
benefit to himself?&nbsp; I can easily conceive that all are
pleased with superiority; but your ignorance was merely
accidental, which, being neither your crime nor your folly, could
afford them no reason to applaud themselves; and the knowledge
which they had, and which you wanted, they might as effectually
have shown by warning as betraying you.?</p><br>
<p>?Pride,? said Imlac, ?is seldom delicate; it
will please itself with very mean advantages, and envy feels not
its own happiness but when it may be compared with the misery of
others.&nbsp; They were my enemies because they grieved to think
me rich, and my oppressors because they delighted to find me
weak.?</p><br>
<p>?Proceed,? said the Prince; ?I doubt not of
the facts which you relate, but imagine that you impute them to
mistaken motives.?</p><br>
<p>?In this company,? said Imlac, ?I arrived at
Agra, the capital of Hindostan, the city in which the Great Mogul
commonly resides.&nbsp; I applied myself to the language of the
country, and in a few months was able to converse with the
learned men; some of whom I found morose and reserved, and others
easy and communicative; some were unwilling to teach another what
they had with difficulty learned themselves; and some showed that
the end of their studies was to gain the dignity of
instructing.</p><br>
<p>?To the tutor of the young princes I recommended myself
so much that I was presented to the Emperor as a man of uncommon
knowledge.&nbsp; The Emperor asked me many questions concerning
my country and my travels, and though I cannot now recollect
anything that he uttered above the power of a common man, he
dismissed me astonished at his wisdom and enamoured of his
goodness.</p><br>
<p>?My credit was now so high that the merchants with whom
I had travelled applied to me for recommendations to the ladies
of the Court.&nbsp; I was surprised at their confidence of
solicitation and greatly reproached them with their practices on
the road.&nbsp; They heard me with cold indifference, and showed
no tokens of shame or sorrow.</p><br>
<p>?They then urged their request with the offer of a
bribe, but what I would not do for kindness I would not do for
money, and refused them, not because they had injured me, but
because I would not enable them to injure others; for I knew they
would have made use of my credit to cheat those who should buy
their wares.</p><br>
<p>?Having resided at Agra till there was no more to be
learned, I travelled into Persia, where I saw many remains of
ancient magnificence and observed many new accommodations of
life.&nbsp; The Persians <span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>are a nation eminently social, and
their assemblies afforded me daily opportunities of remarking
characters and manners, and of tracing human nature through all
its variations.</p><br>
<p>?From Persia I passed into Arabia, where I saw a nation
pastoral and warlike, who lived without any settled habitation,
whose wealth is their flocks and herds, and who have carried on
through ages an hereditary war with mankind, though they neither
covet nor envy their possessions.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br>
IMLAC?S HISTORY (<i>continued</i>)?A DISSERTATION
UPON POETRY.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">Wherever</span> I went I found that
poetry was considered as the highest learning, and regarded with
a veneration somewhat approaching to that which man would pay to
angelic nature.&nbsp; And yet it fills me with wonder that in
almost all countries the most ancient poets are considered as the
best; whether it be that every other kind of knowledge is an
acquisition greatly attained, and poetry is a gift conferred at
once; or that the first poetry of every nation surprised them as
a novelty, and retained the credit by consent which it received
by accident at first; or whether, as the province of poetry is to
describe nature and passion, which are always the same, the first
writers took possession of the most striking objects for
description and the most probable occurrences for fiction, and
left nothing to those that followed them but transcription of the
same events and new combinations of the same images.&nbsp;
Whatever be the reason, it is commonly observed that the early
writers are in possession of nature, and their followers of art;
that the first excel in strength and invention, and the latter in
elegance and refinement.</p><br>
<p>?I was desirous to add my name to this illustrious
fraternity.&nbsp; I read all the poets of Persia and Arabia, and
was able to repeat by memory the volumes that are suspended in
the mosque of Mecca.&nbsp; But I soon found that no man was ever
great by imitations.&nbsp; My desire of excellence impelled me to
transfer my attention to nature and to life.&nbsp; Nature was to
be my subject, and men to be my auditors.&nbsp; I could never
describe what I had not seen.&nbsp; I could not hope to move
those with delight or terror whose interests and opinions I did
not understand.</p><br>
<p>?Being now resolved to be a poet, I saw everything with
a new purpose; my sphere of attention was suddenly magnified; no
kind of knowledge was to be overlooked.&nbsp; I ranged mountains
and deserts for images and resemblances, and pictured upon my
mind every tree of the forest and flower of the valley.&nbsp; I
observed with equal care the crags of the rock and the pinnacles
of the palace.&nbsp; Sometimes I wandered along the mazes of the
rivulet, and sometimes watched the changes of the summer
clouds.&nbsp; To a poet nothing can be useless.&nbsp; Whatever is
beautiful and whatever is dreadful must be familiar to his
imagination; he must be conversant with all that is awfully vast
or elegantly little.&nbsp; The plants of the garden, the animals
of the wood, the minerals of the earth, and meteors of the sky,
must all concur to store his mind with inexhaustible variety; for
every idea is useful for the enforcement or decoration of moral
or religious truth, and he who knows most will have most power of
diversifying his scenes and of gratifying his reader with remote
allusions and unexpected instruction.</p><br>
<p>?All the appearances of nature I was therefore careful
to study, and every country which I have surveyed has contributed
something to my poetical powers.?</p><br>
<p>?In so wide a survey,? said the Prince, ?you
must surely have left much unobserved.&nbsp; I have lived till
now within the circuit of the mountains, and yet cannot walk
abroad without the sight of something which I had never beheld
before, or never heeded.?</p><br>
<p>?This business of a poet,? said Imlac, ?is
to examine, not the individual, but the species; to remark
general properties and large appearances.&nbsp; He does not
number the streaks of the tulip, or describe the different shades
of the verdure of the forest.&nbsp; He is to exhibit in his
portraits of nature such prominent and striking features as
recall the original to every mind, and must neglect the minuter
discriminations, which one may have remarked and another have
neglected, for those characteristics which are alike obvious to
vigilance and carelessness.</p><br>
<p>?But the knowledge of nature is only half the task of a
poet; he must be acquainted likewise with all the modes of
life.&nbsp; His character requires that he estimate the happiness
and misery of every condition, observe the power of all the
passions in all their combinations, and trace the changes of the
human mind, as they are modified by various institutions and
accidental influences of climate or custom, from the
sprightliness of infancy to the despondence of decrepitude.&nbsp;
He must divest himself of the prejudices of his age and country;
he must consider right and wrong in their abstracted and
invariable state; he must disregard present laws and opinions,
and rise to general and transcendental truths, which will always
be the same.&nbsp; He must, therefore, content himself with the
slow progress of his name, contemn the praise of his own time,
and commit his claims to the justice of posterity.&nbsp; He must
write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind,
and consider himself as presiding over the thoughts and manners
of future generations, as a being superior to time and place.</p><br>
<p>?His labour is not yet at an end.&nbsp; He must know
many languages and many sciences, and, that his style may be
worthy of his thoughts, must by incessant practice familiarise to
himself every delicacy of speech and grace of harmony.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>CHAPTER XI<br>
IMLAC?S NARRATIVE (<i>continued</i>)?A HINT OF
PILGRIMAGE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Imlac</span> now felt the enthusiastic
fit, and was proceeding to aggrandise his own profession, when
then Prince cried out: ?Enough! thou hast convinced me that
no human being can ever be a poet.&nbsp; Proceed with thy
narration.?</p><br>
<p>?To be a poet,? said Imlac, ?is indeed very
difficult.?</p><br>
<p>?So difficult,? returned the Prince, ?that I
will at present hear no more of his labours.&nbsp; Tell me
whither you went when you had seen Persia.?</p><br>
<p>?From Persia,? said the poet, ?I travelled
through Syria, and for three years resided in Palestine, where I
conversed with great numbers of the northern and western nations
of Europe, the nations which are now in possession of all power
and all knowledge, whose armies are irresistible, and whose
fleets command the remotest parts of the globe.&nbsp; When I
compared these men with the natives of our own kingdom and those
that surround us, they appeared almost another order of
beings.&nbsp; In their countries it is difficult to wish for
anything that may not be obtained; a thousand arts, of which we
never heard, are continually labouring for their convenience and
pleasure, and whatever their own climate has denied them is
supplied by their commerce.?</p><br>
<p>?By what means,? said the Prince, ?are the
Europeans thus powerful? or why, since they can so easily visit
Asia and Africa for trade or conquest, cannot the Asiatics and
Africans invade their coast, plant colonies in their ports, and
give laws to their natural princes?&nbsp; The same wind that
carries them back would bring us thither.?</p><br>
<p>?They are more powerful, sir, than we,? answered
Imlac, ?because they are wiser; knowledge will always
predominate over ignorance, as man governs the other
animals.&nbsp; But why their knowledge is more than ours I know
not what reason can be given but the unsearchable will of the
Supreme Being.?</p><br>
<p>?When,? said the Prince with a sigh, ?shall
I be able to visit Palestine, and mingle with this mighty
confluence of nations?&nbsp; Till that happy moment shall arrive,
let me fill up the time with such representations as thou canst
give me.&nbsp; I am not ignorant of the motive that assembles
such numbers in that place, and cannot but consider it as the
centre of wisdom and piety, to which the best and wisest men of
every land must be continually resorting.?</p><br>
<p>?There are some nations,? said Imlac, ?that
send few visitants to Palestine; for many numerous and learned
sects in Europe concur to censure pilgrimage as superstitious, or
deride it as ridiculous.?</p><br>
<p>?You know,? said the Prince, ?how little my
life has made me acquainted with diversity of opinions; it will
be too long to hear the arguments on both sides; you, that have
considered them, tell me the result.?</p><br>
<p>?Pilgrimage,? said Imlac, ?like many other
acts of piety, may be reasonable or superstitious, according to
the principles upon which it is performed.&nbsp; Long journeys in
search of truth are not commanded.&nbsp; Truth, such as is
necessary to the regulation of life, is always found where it is
honestly sought.&nbsp; Change of place is no natural cause of the
increase of piety, for it inevitably produces dissipation of
mind.&nbsp; Yet, since men go every day to view the fields where
great actions have been performed, and return with stronger
impressions of the event, curiosity of the same kind may
naturally dispose us to view that country whence our religion had
its beginning, and I believe no man surveys those awful scenes
without some confirmation of holy resolutions.&nbsp; That the
Supreme Being may be more easily propitiated in one place than in
another is the dream of idle superstition, but that some places
may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner is an
opinion which hourly experience will justify.&nbsp; He who
supposes that his vices may be more successfully combated in
Palestine, will perhaps find himself mistaken; yet he may go
thither without folly; he who thinks they will be more freely
pardoned, dishonours at once his reason and religion.?</p><br>
<p>?These,? said the Prince, ?are European
distinctions.&nbsp; I will consider them another time.&nbsp; What
have you found to be the effect of knowledge?&nbsp; Are those
nations happier than we??</p><br>
<p>?There is so much infelicity,? said the poet,
?in the world, that scarce any man has leisure from his own
distresses to estimate the comparative happiness of others.&nbsp;
Knowledge is certainly one of the means of pleasure, as is
confessed by the natural desire which every mind feels of
increasing its ideas.&nbsp; Ignorance is mere privation, by which
nothing can be produced; it is a vacuity in which the soul sits
motionless and torpid for want of attraction, and, without
knowing why, we always rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we
forget.&nbsp; I am therefore inclined to conclude that if nothing
counteracts the natural consequence of learning, we grow more
happy as out minds take a wider range.</p><br>
<p>?In enumerating the particular comforts of life, we
shall find many advantages on the side of the Europeans.&nbsp;
They cure wounds and diseases with which we languish and
perish.&nbsp; We suffer inclemencies of weather which they can
obviate.&nbsp; They have engines for the despatch of many
laborious works, which we must perform by manual industry.&nbsp;
There is such communication between distant places that one
friend can hardly be said to be absent from another.&nbsp; Their
policy removes all public inconveniences; they have roads cut
through the mountains, and bridges laid over their rivers.&nbsp;
And, if we descend to the privacies of life, their habitations
are more commodious and their possessions are more
secure.?</p><br>
<p>?They are surely happy,? said the Prince,
?who have all these conveniences, of which I envy none so
much as the facility with which separated friends interchange
their thoughts.?</p><br>
<p>?The Europeans,? answered Imlac, ?are less
<span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>unhappy
than we, but they are not happy.&nbsp; Human life is everywhere a
state in which much is to be endured and little to be
enjoyed.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br>
THE STORY OF IMLAC (<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p>?I <span class="smcap">am</span> not willing,?
said the Prince, ?to suppose that happiness is so
parsimoniously distributed to mortals, nor can I believe but
that, if I had the choice of life, I should be able to fill every
day with pleasure.&nbsp; I would injure no man, and should
provoke no resentments; I would relieve every distress, and
should enjoy the benedictions of gratitude.&nbsp; I would choose
my friends among the wise and my wife among the virtuous, and
therefore should be in no danger from treachery or
unkindness.&nbsp; My children should by my care be learned and
pious, and would repay to my age what their childhood had
received.&nbsp; What would dare to molest him who might call on
every side to thousands enriched by his bounty or assisted by his
power?&nbsp; And why should not life glide away in the soft
reciprocation of protection and reverence?&nbsp; All this may be
done without the help of European refinements, which appear by
their effects to be rather specious than useful.&nbsp; Let us
leave them and pursue our journey.?</p><br>
<p>?From Palestine,? said Imlac, ?I passed
through many regions of Asia; in the more civilised kingdoms as a
trader, and among the barbarians of the mountains as a
pilgrim.&nbsp; At last I began to long for my native country,
that I might repose after my travels and fatigues in the places
where I had spent my earliest years, and gladden my old
companions with the recital of my adventures.&nbsp; Often did I
figure to myself those with whom I had sported away the gay hours
of dawning life, sitting round me in its evening, wondering at my
tales and listening to my counsels.</p><br>
<p>?When this thought had taken possession of my mind, I
considered every moment as wasted which did not bring me nearer
to Abyssinia.&nbsp; I hastened into Egypt, and, notwithstanding
my impatience, was detained ten months in the contemplation of
its ancient magnificence and in inquiries after the remains of
its ancient learning.&nbsp; I found in Cairo a mixture of all
nations: some brought thither by the love of knowledge, some by
the hope of gain; many by the desire of living after their own
manner without observation, and of lying hid in the obscurity of
multitudes; for in a city populous as Cairo it is possible to
obtain at the same time the gratifications of society and the
secrecy of solitude.</p><br>
<p>?From Cairo I travelled to Suez, and embarked on the Red
Sea, passing along the coast till I arrived at the port from
which I had departed twenty years before.&nbsp; Here I joined
myself to a caravan, and re-entered my native country.</p><br>
<p>?I now expected the caresses of my kinsmen and the
congratulations of my friends, and was not without hope that my
father, whatever value he had set upon riches, would own with
gladness and pride a son who was able to add to the felicity and
honour of the nation.&nbsp; But I was soon convinced that my
thoughts were vain.&nbsp; My father had been dead fourteen years,
having divided his wealth among my brothers, who were removed to
some other provinces.&nbsp; Of my companions, the greater part
was in the grave; of the rest, some could with difficulty
remember me, and some considered me as one corrupted by foreign
manners.</p><br>
<p>?A man used to vicissitudes is not easily
dejected.&nbsp; I forgot, after a time, my disappointment, and
endeavoured to recommend myself to the nobles of the kingdom;
they admitted me to their tables, heard my story, and dismissed
me.&nbsp; I opened a school, and was prohibited to teach.&nbsp; I
then resolved to sit down in the quiet of domestic life, and
addressed a lady that was fond of my conversation, but rejected
my suit because my father was a merchant.</p><br>
<p>?Wearied at last with solicitation and repulses, I
resolved to hide myself for ever from the world, and depend no
longer on the opinion or caprice of others.&nbsp; I waited for
the time when the gate of the Happy Valley should open, that I
might bid farewell to hope and fear; the day came, my performance
was distinguished with favour, and I resigned myself with joy to
perpetual confinement.?</p><br>
<p>?Hast thou here found happiness at last?? said
Rasselas.&nbsp; ?Tell me, without reserve, art thou content
with thy condition, or dost thou wish to be again wandering and
inquiring?&nbsp; All the inhabitants of this valley celebrate
their lot, and at the annual visit of the Emperor invite others
to partake of their felicity.?</p><br>
<p>?Great Prince,? said Imlac, ?I shall speak
the truth.&nbsp; I know not one of all your attendants who does
not lament the hour when he entered this retreat.&nbsp; I am less
unhappy than the rest, because I have a mind replete with images,
which I can vary and combine at pleasure.&nbsp; I can amuse my
solitude by the renovation of the knowledge which begins to fade
from my memory, and by recollection of the accidents of my past
life.&nbsp; Yet all this ends in the sorrowful consideration that
my acquirements are now useless, and that none of my pleasures
can be again enjoyed.&nbsp; The rest, whose minds have no
impression but of the present moment, are either corroded by
malignant passions or sit stupid in the gloom of perpetual
vacancy.?</p><br>
<p>?What passions can infest those,? said the Prince,
?who have no rivals?&nbsp; We are in a place where
impotence precludes malice, and where all envy is repressed by
community of enjoyments.?</p><br>
<p>?There may be community,? said Imlac, ?of
material possessions, but there can never be community of love or
of esteem.&nbsp; It must happen that one will please more than
another; he that knows himself despised will always be envious,
and still more envious and malevolent if he is condemned to live
in the presence of those who despise him.&nbsp; The invitations
by which they allure others to a state which they feel to be
wretched, proceed from the natural malignity of hopeless
misery.&nbsp; They are weary of themselves and of each other, and
expect to find relief in new companions.&nbsp; They envy the
liberty which their folly has forfeited, and would gladly see all
mankind imprisoned like themselves.</p><br>
<p>?From this crime, however, I am wholly free.&nbsp; No
man can say that he is wretched by my persuasion.&nbsp; I look
with pity on the crowds who are annually soliciting admission to
captivity, and wish that it were lawful for me to warn them of
their danger.?</p><br>
<p>?My dear Imlac,? said the Prince, ?I will
open to thee my whole heart.&nbsp; I have long meditated an
escape from the Happy Valley.&nbsp; I have examined the mountain
on every side, but find myself insuperably barred?teach me
the way to break my prison; thou shalt be the companion of my
flight, the guide of my rambles, the partner of my fortune, and
my sole director in the <i>choice of life</i>.</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? answered the poet, ?your escape will
be difficult, and perhaps you may soon repent your
curiosity.&nbsp; The world, which you figure to yourself smooth
and quiet as the lake in the valley, you will find a sea foaming
with tempests and boiling with whirlpools; you will be sometimes
overwhelmed by the waves of violence, and sometimes dashed
against the rocks of treachery.&nbsp; Amidst wrongs and frauds,
competitions and anxieties, you will wish a thousand <span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>times for
these seats of quiet, and willingly quit hope to be free from
fear.?</p><br>
<p>?Do not seek to deter me from my purpose,? said
the Prince.&nbsp; ?I am impatient to see what thou hast
seen; and since thou art thyself weary of the valley, it is
evident that thy former state was better than this.&nbsp;
Whatever be the consequence of my experiment, I am resolved to
judge with mine own eyes of the various conditions of men, and
then to make deliberately my <i>choice of life</i>.?</p><br>
<p>?I am afraid,? said Imlac, ?you are hindered
by stronger restraints than my persuasions; yet, if your
determination is fixed, I do not counsel you to despair.&nbsp;
Few things are impossible to diligence and skill.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br>
RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince now dismissed his
favourite to rest; but the narrative of wonders and novelties
filled his mind with perturbation.&nbsp; He revolved all that he
had heard, and prepared innumerable questions for the
morning.</p><br>
<p>Much of his uneasiness was now removed.&nbsp; He had a friend
to whom he could impart his thoughts, and whose experience could
assist him in his designs.&nbsp; His heart was no longer
condemned to swell with silent vexation.&nbsp; He thought that
even the Happy Valley might be endured with such a companion, and
that if they could range the world together he should have
nothing further to desire.</p><br>
<p>In a few days the water was discharged, and the ground
dried.&nbsp; The Prince and Imlac then walked out together, to
converse without the notice of the rest.&nbsp; The Prince, whose
thoughts were always on the wing, as he passed by the gate said,
with a countenance of sorrow, ?Why art thou so strong, and
why is man so weak??</p><br>
<p>?Man is not weak,? answered his companion;
?knowledge is more than equivalent to force.&nbsp; The
master of mechanics laughs at strength.&nbsp; I can burst the
gate, but cannot do it secretly.&nbsp; Some other expedient must
be tried.?</p><br>
<p>As they were walking on the side of the mountain they observed
that the coneys, which the rain had driven from their burrows,
had taken shelter among the bushes, and formed holes behind them
tending upwards in an oblique line.&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It has
been the opinion of antiquity,? said Imlac, ?that
human reason borrowed many arts from the instinct of animals; let
us, therefore, not think ourselves degraded by learning from the
coney.&nbsp; We may escape by piercing the mountain in the same
direction.&nbsp; We will begin where the summit hangs over the
middle part, and labour upward till we shall issue out beyond the
prominence.?</p><br>
<p>The eyes of the Prince, when he heard this proposal, sparkled
with joy.&nbsp; The execution was easy and the success
certain.</p><br>
<p>No time was now lost.&nbsp; They hastened early in the morning
to choose a place proper for their mine.&nbsp; They clambered
with great fatigue among crags and brambles, and returned without
having discovered any part that favoured their design.&nbsp; The
second and the third day were spent in the same manner, and with
the same frustration; but on the fourth day they found a small
cavern concealed by a thicket, where they resolved to make their
experiment.</p><br>
<p>Imlac procured instruments proper to hew stone and remove
earth, and they fell to their work on the next day with more
eagerness than vigour.&nbsp; They were presently exhausted by
their efforts, and sat down to pant upon the grass.&nbsp; The
Prince for a moment appeared to be discouraged.&nbsp;
?Sir,? said his companion, ?practice will
enable us to continue our labour for a longer time.&nbsp; Mark,
however, how far we have advanced, and ye will find that our toil
will some time have an end.&nbsp; Great works are performed not
by strength, but perseverance; yonder palace was raised by single
stones, yet you see its height and spaciousness.&nbsp; He that
shall walk with vigour three hours a day, will pass in seven
years a space equal to the circumference of the globe.?</p><br>
<p>They returned to their work day after day, and in a short time
found a fissure in the rock, which enabled them to pass far with
very little obstruction.&nbsp; This Rasselas considered as a good
omen.&nbsp; ?Do not disturb your mind,? said Imlac,
?with other hopes or fears than reason may suggest; if you
are pleased with the prognostics of good, you will be terrified
likewise with tokens of evil, and your whole life will be a prey
to superstition.&nbsp; Whatever facilitates our work is more than
an omen; it is a cause of success.&nbsp; This is one of those
pleasing surprises which often happen to active resolution.&nbsp;
Many things difficult to design prove easy to
performance.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>CHAPTER XIV<br>
RASSELAS AND IMLAC RECEIVE AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had now wrought their way to
the middle, and solaced their toil with the approach of liberty,
when the Prince, coming down to refresh himself with air, found
his sister Nekayah standing at the mouth of the cavity.&nbsp; He
started, and stood confused, afraid to tell his design, and yet
hopeless to conceal it.&nbsp; A few moments determined him to
repose on her fidelity, and secure her secrecy by a declaration
without reserve.</p><br>
<p>?Do not imagine,? said the Princess, ?that I
came hither as a spy.&nbsp; I had long observed from my window
that you and Imlac directed your walk every day towards the same
point, but I did not suppose you had any better reason for the
preference than a cooler shade or more fragrant bank, nor
followed you with any other design than to partake of your
conversation.&nbsp; Since, then, not suspicion, but fondness, has
detected you, let me not lose the advantage of my
discovery.&nbsp; I am equally weary of confinement with yourself,
and not less desirous of knowing what is done or suffered in the
world.&nbsp; Permit me to fly with you from this tasteless
tranquillity, which will yet grow more loathsome when you have
left me.&nbsp; You may deny me to accompany you, but cannot
hinder me from following.?</p><br>
<p>The Prince, who loved Nekayah above his other sisters, had no
inclination to refuse her request, and grieved that he had lost
an opportunity of showing his confidence by a voluntary
communication.&nbsp; It was, therefore, agreed that she should
leave the valley with them; and that in the meantime she should
watch, lest any other straggler should, by chance or curiosity,
follow them to the mountain.</p><br>
<p>At length their labour was at an end.&nbsp; They saw light
beyond the prominence, and, issuing to the top of the mountain,
beheld the Nile, yet a narrow current, wandering beneath
them.</p><br>
<p>The Prince looked round with rapture, anticipated all the
pleasures of travel, and in thought was already transported
beyond his father?s dominions.&nbsp; Imlac, though very
joyful at his escape, had less expectation of pleasure in the
world, which he had before tried and of which he had been
weary.</p><br>
<p>Rasselas was so much delighted with a wider horizon, that he
could not soon be persuaded to <span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>return into the valley.&nbsp; He
informed his sister that the way was now open, and that nothing
now remained but to prepare for their departure.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br>
THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS LEAVE THE VALLEY, AND SEE MANY
WONDERS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince and Princess had jewels
sufficient to make them rich whenever they came into a place of
commerce, which, by Imlac?s direction, they hid in their
clothes, and on the night of the next full moon all left the
valley.&nbsp; The Princess was followed only by a single
favourite, who did not know whither she was going.</p><br>
<p>They clambered through the cavity, and began to go down on the
other side.&nbsp; The Princess and her maid turned their eyes
toward every part, and seeing nothing to bound their prospect,
considered themselves in danger of being lost in a dreary
vacuity.&nbsp; They stopped and trembled.&nbsp; ?I am
almost afraid,? said the Princess, ?to begin a
journey of which I cannot perceive an end, and to venture into
this immense plain where I may be approached on every side by men
whom I never saw.?&nbsp; The Prince felt nearly the same
emotions, though he thought it more manly to conceal them.</p><br>
<p>Imlac smiled at their terrors, and encouraged them to
proceed.&nbsp; But the Princess continued irresolute till she had
been imperceptibly drawn forward too far to return.</p><br>
<p>In the morning they found some shepherds in the field, who set
some milk and fruits before them.&nbsp; The Princess wondered
that she did not see a palace ready for her reception and a table
spread with delicacies; but being faint and hungry, she drank the
milk and ate the fruits, and thought them of a higher flavour
than the products of the valley.</p><br>
<p>They travelled forward by easy journeys, being all
unaccustomed to toil and difficulty, and knowing that, though
they might be missed, they could not be pursued.&nbsp; In a few
days they came into a more populous region, where Imlac was
diverted with the admiration which his companions expressed at
the diversity of manners, stations, and employments.&nbsp; Their
dress was such as might not bring upon them the suspicion of
having anything to conceal; yet the Prince, wherever he came,
expected to be obeyed, and the Princess was frighted because
those who came into her presence did not prostrate
themselves.&nbsp; Imlac was forced to observe them with great
vigilance, lest they should betray their rank by their unusual
behaviour, and detained them several weeks in the first village
to accustom them to the sight of common mortals.</p><br>
<p>By degrees the royal wanderers were taught to understand that
they had for a time laid aside their dignity, and were to expect
only such regard as liberality and courtesy could procure.&nbsp;
And Imlac having by many admonitions prepared them to endure the
tumults of a port and the ruggedness of the commercial race,
brought them down to the sea-coast.</p><br>
<p>The Prince and his sister, to whom everything was new, were
gratified equally at all places, and therefore remained for some
months at the port without any inclination to pass further.&nbsp;
Imlac was content with their stay, because he did not think it
safe to expose them, unpractised in the world, to the hazards of
a foreign country.</p><br>
<p>At last he began to fear lest they should be discovered, and
proposed to fix a day for their departure.&nbsp; They had no
pretensions to judge for themselves, and referred the whole
scheme to his direction.&nbsp; He therefore took passage in a
ship to Suez, and, when the time came, with great difficulty <span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>prevailed on
the Princess to enter the vessel.&nbsp; They had a quick and
prosperous voyage, and from Suez travelled by land to Cairo.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br>
THEY ENTER CAIRO, AND FIND EVERY MAN HAPPY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> they approached the city, which
filled the strangers with astonishment, ?This,? said
Imlac to the Prince, ?is the place where travellers and
merchants assemble from all corners of the earth.&nbsp; You will
here find men of every character and every occupation.&nbsp;
Commerce is here honourable.&nbsp; I will act as a merchant, and
you shall live as strangers who have no other end of travel than
curiosity; it will soon be observed that we are rich.&nbsp; Our
reputation will procure us access to all whom we shall desire to
know; you shall see all the conditions of humanity, and enable
yourselves at leisure to make your <i>choice of
life</i>.?</p><br>
<p>They now entered the town, stunned by the noise and offended
by the crowds.&nbsp; Instruction had not yet so prevailed over
habit but that they wondered to see themselves pass
undistinguished along the streets, and met by the lowest of the
people without reverence or notice.&nbsp; The Princess could not
at first bear the thought of being levelled with the vulgar, and
for some time continued in her chamber, where she was served by
her favourite Pekuah, as in the palace of the valley.</p><br>
<p>Imlac, who understood traffic, sold part of the jewels the
next day, and hired a house, which he adorned with such
magnificence that he was immediately considered as a merchant of
great wealth.&nbsp; His politeness attracted many acquaintances,
and his generosity made him courted by many dependants.&nbsp; His
companions, not being able to mix in the conversation, could make
no discovery of their ignorance or surprise, and were gradually
initiated in the world as they gained knowledge of the
language.</p><br>
<p>The Prince had by frequent lectures been taught the use and
nature of money; but the ladies could not for a long time
comprehend what the merchants did with small pieces of gold and
silver, or why things of so little use should be received as an
equivalent to the necessaries of life.</p><br>
<p>They studied the language two years, while Imlac was preparing
to set before them the various ranks and conditions of
mankind.&nbsp; He grew acquainted with all who had anything
uncommon in their fortune or conduct.&nbsp; He frequented the
voluptuous and the frugal, the idle and the busy, the merchants
and the men of learning.</p><br>
<p>The Prince now being able to converse with fluency, and having
learned the caution necessary to be observed in his intercourse
with strangers, began to accompany Imlac to places of resort, and
to enter into all assemblies, that he might make his <i>choice of
life</i>.</p><br>
<p>For some time he thought choice needless, because all appeared
to him really happy.&nbsp; Wherever he went he met gaiety and
kindness, and heard the song of joy or the laugh of
carelessness.&nbsp; He began to believe that the world overflowed
with universal plenty, and that nothing was withheld either from
want or merit; that every hand showered liberality and every
heart melted with benevolence: ?And who then,? says
he, ?will be suffered to be wretched??</p><br>
<p>Imlac permitted the pleasing delusion, and was unwilling to
crush the hope of inexperience: till one day, having sat awhile
silent, ?I know not,? said the Prince, ?what
can be the reason that I am more unhappy than any of our
friends.&nbsp; I see them perpetually and unalterably cheerful,
but feel my own mind restless and uneasy.&nbsp; I am unsatisfied
with those pleasures which I seem most to court.&nbsp; I live in
the crowds of jollity, not so much to enjoy company as to shun
myself, and am only loud and merry to conceal my
sadness.?</p><br>
<p>?Every man,? said Imlac, ?may by examining
his own mind guess what passes in the minds of others.&nbsp; When
you feel that your own gaiety is counterfeit, it may justly lead
you to suspect that of your companions not to be sincere.&nbsp;
Envy is commonly reciprocal.&nbsp; We are long before we are
convinced that happiness is never to be found, and each believes
it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it
for himself.&nbsp; In the assembly where you passed the last
night there appeared such sprightliness of air and volatility of
fancy as might have suited beings of a higher order, formed to
inhabit serener regions, inaccessible to care or sorrow; yet,
believe me, Prince, was there not one who did not dread the
moment when solitude should deliver him to the tyranny of
reflection.?</p><br>
<p>?This,? said the Prince, ?may be true of
others since it is true of me; yet, whatever be the general
infelicity of man, one condition is more happy than another, and
wisdom surely directs us to take the least evil in the <i>choice
of life</i>.?</p><br>
<p>?The causes of good and evil,? answered Imlac,
?are so various and uncertain, so often entangled with each
other, so diversified by various relations, and so much subject
to accidents which cannot be foreseen, that he who would fix his
condition upon incontestable reasons of preference must live and
die inquiring and deliberating.?</p><br>
<p>?But, surely,? said Rasselas, ?the wise men,
to whom we listen with reverence and wonder, chose that mode of
life for themselves which they thought most likely to make them
happy.?</p><br>
<p>?Very few,? said the poet, ?live by
choice.&nbsp; Every man is placed in the present condition by
causes which acted without his foresight, and with which he did
not always willingly co-operate, and therefore you will rarely
meet one who does not think the lot of his neighbour better than
his own.?</p><br>
<p>?I am pleased to think,? said the Prince,
?that my birth has given me at least one advantage over
others by enabling me to determine for myself.&nbsp; I have here
the world before me.&nbsp; I will review it at leisure: surely
happiness is somewhere to be found.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>CHAPTER XVII<br>
THE PRINCE ASSOCIATES WITH YOUNG MEN OF SPIRIT AND GAIETY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Rasselas</span> rose next day, and
resolved to begin his experiments upon life.&nbsp;
?Youth,? cried he, ?is the time of gladness: I
will join myself to the young men whose only business is to
gratify their desires, and whose time is all spent in a
succession of enjoyments.?</p><br>
<p>To such societies he was readily admitted, but a few days
brought him back weary and disgusted.&nbsp; Their mirth was
without images, their laughter without motive; their pleasures
were gross and sensual, in which the mind had no part; their
conduct was at once wild and mean?they laughed at order and
at law, but the frown of power dejected and the eye of wisdom
abashed them.</p><br>
<p>The Prince soon concluded that he should never be happy in a
course of life of which he was ashamed.&nbsp; He thought it
unsuitable to a reasonable being to act without a plan, and to be
sad or cheerful only by chance.&nbsp; ?Happiness,?
said he, ?must be something solid and permanent, without
fear and without uncertainty.?</p><br>
<p>But his young companions had gained so much of his regard by
their frankness and courtesy that he could not leave them without
warning and remonstrance.&nbsp; ?My friends,? said
he, ?I have seriously considered our manners and our
prospects, and find that we have mistaken our own interest.&nbsp;
The first years of man must make provision for the last.&nbsp; He
that never thinks, never can be wise.&nbsp; Perpetual levity must
end in ignorance; and intemperance, though it may fire the
spirits for an hour, will make life short or miserable.&nbsp; Let
us consider that youth is of no long duration, and that in mature
age, when the enchantments of fancy shall cease, and phantoms of
delight dance no more about us, we shall have no comforts but the
esteem of wise men and the means of doing good.&nbsp; Let us
therefore stop while to stop is in our power: let us live as men
who are some time to grow old, and to whom it will be the most
dreadful of all evils to count their past years by follies, and
to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only by the
maladies which riot has produced.?</p><br>
<p>They stared awhile in silence one upon another, and at last
drove him away by a general chorus of continued laughter.</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>The
consciousness that his sentiments were just and his intention
kind was scarcely sufficient to support him against the horror of
derision.&nbsp; But he recovered his tranquillity and pursued his
search.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br>
THE PRINCE FINDS A WISE AND HAPPY MAN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> he was one day walking in the
street he saw a spacious building which all were by the open
doors invited to enter.&nbsp; He followed the stream of people,
and found it a hall or school of declamation, in which professors
read lectures to their auditory.&nbsp; He fixed his eye upon a
sage raised above the rest, who discoursed with great energy on
the government of the passions.&nbsp; His look was venerable, his
action graceful, his pronunciation clear, and his diction
elegant.&nbsp; He showed with great strength of sentiment and
variety of illustration that human nature is degraded and debased
when the lower faculties predominate over the higher; that when
fancy, the parent of passion, usurps the dominion of the mind,
nothing ensues but the natural effect of unlawful government,
perturbation, and confusion; that she betrays the fortresses of
the intellect to rebels, and excites her children to sedition
against their lawful sovereign.&nbsp; He compared reason to the
sun, of which the light is constant, uniform, and lasting; and
fancy to a meteor, of bright but transitory lustre, irregular in
its motion and delusive in its direction.</p><br>
<p>He then communicated the various precepts given from time to
time for the conquest of passion, and displayed the happiness of
those who had obtained the important victory, after which man is
no longer the slave of fear nor the fool of hope; is no more
emaciated by envy, inflamed by anger, emasculated by tenderness,
or depressed by grief; but walks on calmly through the tumults or
privacies of life, as the sun pursues alike his course through
the calm or the stormy sky.</p><br>
<p>He enumerated many examples of heroes immovable by pain or
pleasure, who looked with indifference on those modes or
accidents to which the vulgar give the names of good and
evil.&nbsp; He exhorted his hearers to lay aside their
prejudices, and arm themselves against the shafts of malice or
misfortune, by invulnerable patience: concluding that this state
only was happiness, and that this happiness was in every
one?s power.</p><br>
<p>Rasselas listened to him with the veneration due to the
instructions of a superior being, and waiting for him at the
door, humbly implored the liberty of visiting so great a master
of true wisdom.&nbsp; The lecturer hesitated a moment, when
Rasselas put a purse of gold into his hand, which he received
with a mixture of joy and wonder.</p><br>
<p>?I have found,? said the Prince at his return to
Imlac, ?a man who can teach all that is necessary to be
known; who, from the unshaken throne of rational fortitude, looks
down on the scenes of life changing beneath him.&nbsp; He speaks,
and attention watches his lips.&nbsp; He reasons, and conviction
closes his periods.&nbsp; This man shall be my future guide: I
will learn his doctrines and imitate his life.?</p><br>
<p>?Be not too hasty,? said Imlac, ?to trust or
to admire the teachers of morality: they discourse like angels,
but they live like men.?</p><br>
<p>Rasselas, who could not conceive how any man could reason so
forcibly without feeling the cogency of his own arguments, paid
his visit in a few days, and was denied admission.&nbsp; He had
now learned the power of money, and made his way by a piece of
gold to the inner apartment, where he found the philosopher in a
room half darkened, with his eyes misty and his face pale.&nbsp;
?Sir,? said he, ?you are come at a time when
all human friendship is useless; what I suffer cannot be
remedied: what I have lost cannot be supplied.&nbsp; My daughter,
my only daughter, from whose tenderness I expected all the
comforts of my age, died last night of a fever.&nbsp; My views,
my purposes, my hopes, are at an end: I am now a lonely being,
disunited from society.?</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? said the Prince, ?mortality is an
event by which a wise man can never be surprised: we know that
death is always near, and it should therefore always be
expected.?&nbsp; ?Young man,? answered the
philosopher, ?you speak like one that has never felt the
pangs of separation.?&nbsp; ?Have you then forgot the
precepts,? said Rasselas, ?which you so powerfully
enforced?&nbsp; Has wisdom no strength to arm the heart against
calamity?&nbsp; Consider that external things are naturally
variable, but truth and reason are always the same.?&nbsp;
?What comfort,? said the mourner, ?can truth
and reason afford me?&nbsp; Of what effect are they now, but to
tell me that my daughter will not be restored??</p><br>
<p>The Prince, whose humanity would not suffer him to insult
misery with reproof, went away, convinced of the emptiness of
rhetorical sounds, and the inefficacy of polished periods and
studied sentences.</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>CHAPTER XIX<br>
A GLIMPSE OF PASTORAL LIFE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was still eager upon the same
inquiry; and having heard of a hermit that lived near the lowest
cataract of the Nile, and filled the whole country with the fame
of his sanctity, resolved to visit his retreat, and inquire
whether that felicity which public life could not afford was to
be found in solitude, and whether a man whose age and virtue made
him venerable could teach any peculiar art of shunning evils or
enduring them.</p><br>
<p>Imlac and the Princess agreed to accompany him, and after the
necessary preparations, they began their journey.&nbsp; Their way
lay through the fields, where shepherds tended their flocks and
the lambs were playing upon the pasture.&nbsp;
?This,? said the poet, ?is the life which has
been often celebrated for its innocence and quiet; let us pass
the heat of the day among the shepherds? tents, and know
whether all our searches are not to terminate in pastoral
simplicity.?</p><br>
<p>The proposal pleased them; and they induced the shepherds, by
small presents and familiar questions, to tell the opinion of
their own state.&nbsp; They were so rude and ignorant, so little
able to compare the good with the evil of the occupation, and so
indistinct in their narratives and descriptions, that very little
could be learned from them.&nbsp; But it was evident that their
hearts were cankered with discontent; that they considered
themselves as condemned to labour for the luxury of the rich, and
looked up with stupid malevolence towards those that were placed
above them.</p><br>
<p>The Princess pronounced with vehemence that she would never
suffer these envious savages to be her companions, and that she
should not soon be desirous of seeing any more specimens of
rustic happiness; but could not believe that all the accounts of
primeval pleasures were fabulous, and was in doubt whether life
had anything that could be justly preferred to the placid
gratification of fields and woods.&nbsp; She hoped that the time
would come when, with a few virtuous and elegant companions, she
should gather flowers planted by her own hands, fondle the lambs
of her own ewe, and listen without care, among brooks and
breezes, to one of her maidens reading in the shade.</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>CHAPTER XX<br>
THE DANGER OF PROSPERITY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next day they continued
their journey till the heat compelled them to look round for
shelter.&nbsp; At a small distance they saw a thick wood, which
they no sooner entered than they perceived that they were
approaching the habitations of men.&nbsp; The shrubs were
diligently cut away to open walks where the shades ware darkest;
the boughs of opposite trees were artificially interwoven; seats
of flowery turf were raised in vacant spaces; and a rivulet that
wantoned along the side of a winding path had its banks sometimes
opened into small basins, and its stream sometimes obstructed by
little mounds of stone heaped together to increase its
murmurs.</p><br>
<p>They passed slowly through the wood, delighted with such
unexpected accommodations, and entertained each other with
conjecturing what or who he could be that in those rude and
unfrequented regions had leisure and art for such harmless
luxury.</p><br>
<p>As they advanced they heard the sound of music, and saw youths
and virgins dancing in the grove; and going still farther beheld
a stately palace built upon a hill surrounded by woods.&nbsp; The
laws of Eastern hospitality allowed them to enter, and the master
welcomed them like a man liberal and wealthy.</p><br>
<p>He was skilful enough in appearances soon to discern that they
were no common guests, and spread his table with
magnificence.&nbsp; The eloquence of Imlac caught his attention,
and the lofty courtesy of the Princess excited his respect.&nbsp;
When they offered to depart, he entreated their stay, and was the
next day more unwilling to dismiss them than before.&nbsp; They
were easily persuaded to stop, and civility grew up in time to
freedom and confidence.</p><br>
<p>The Prince now saw all the domestics cheerful and all the face
of nature smiling round the place, and could not forbear to hope
that he should find here what he was seeking; but when he was
congratulating the master upon his possessions he answered with a
sigh, ?My condition has indeed the appearance of happiness,
but appearances are delusive.&nbsp; My prosperity puts my life in
danger; the Bassa of Egypt is my enemy, incensed only by my
wealth and popularity.&nbsp; I have been hitherto protected
against him by the princes of the country; but as the favour of
the great is uncertain I know <span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>not how soon my defenders may be
persuaded to share the plunder with the Bassa.&nbsp; I have sent
my treasures into a distant country, and upon the first alarm am
prepared to follow them.&nbsp; Then will my enemies riot in my
mansion, and enjoy the gardens which I have planted.?</p><br>
<p>They all joined in lamenting his danger and deprecating his
exile; and the Princess was so much disturbed with the tumult of
grief and indignation that she retired to her apartment.&nbsp;
They continued with their kind inviter a few days longer, and
then went to find the hermit.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br>
THE HAPPINESS OF SOLITUDE?THE HERMIT?S HISTORY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> came on the third day, by the
direction of the peasants, to the hermit?s cell.&nbsp; It
was a cavern in the side of a mountain, overshadowed with palm
trees, at such a distance from the cataract that nothing more was
heard than a gentle uniform murmur, such as composes the mind to
pensive meditation, especially when it was assisted by the wind
whistling among the branches.&nbsp; The first rude essay of
Nature had been so much improved by human labour that the cave
contained several apartments appropriated to different uses, and
often afforded lodging to travellers whom darkness or tempests
happened to overtake.</p><br>
<p>The hermit sat on a bench at the door, to enjoy the coolness
of the evening.&nbsp; On one side lay a book with pens and paper;
on the other mechanical instruments of various kinds.&nbsp; As
they approached him unregarded, the Princess observed that he had
not the countenance of a man that had found or could teach the
way to happiness.</p><br>
<p>They saluted him with great respect, which he repaid like a
man not unaccustomed to the forms of Courts.&nbsp; ?My
children,? said he, ?if you have lost your way, you
shall be willingly supplied with such conveniences for the night
as this cavern will afford.&nbsp; I have all that Nature
requires, and you will not expect delicacies in a hermit?s
cell.?</p><br>
<p>They thanked him; and, entering, were pleased with the
neatness and regularity of the place.&nbsp; The hermit set flesh
and wine before them, though he fed only upon fruits and
water.&nbsp; His discourse was cheerful without levity, and pious
without enthusiasm.&nbsp; He soon gained the esteem of his
guests, and the Princess repented her hasty censure.</p><br>
<p>At last Imlac began thus: ?I do not now wonder that your
reputation is so far extended: we have heard at Cairo of your
wisdom, and came hither to implore your direction for this young
man and maiden in the <i>choice of life</i>.?</p><br>
<p>?To him that lives well,? answered the hermit,
?every form of life is good; nor can I give any other rule
for choice than to remove all apparent evil.?</p><br>
<p>?He will most certainly remove from evil,? said
the Prince, ?who shall devote himself to that solitude
which you have recommended by your example.?</p><br>
<p>?I have indeed lived fifteen years in solitude,?
said the hermit, ?but have no desire that my example should
gain any imitators.&nbsp; In my youth I professed arms, and was
raised by degrees to the highest military rank.&nbsp; I have
traversed wide countries at the head of my troops, and seen many
battles and sieges.&nbsp; At last, being disgusted by the
preferments of a younger officer, and feeling that my vigour was
beginning to decay, I resolved to close my life in peace, having
found the world full of snares, discord, and misery.&nbsp; I had
once escaped from the pursuit of the enemy by the shelter of this
cavern, and therefore chose it for my final residence.&nbsp; I
employed artificers to form it into chambers, and stored it with
all that I was likely to want.</p><br>
<p>?For some time after my retreat I rejoiced like a
tempest-beaten sailor at his entrance into the harbour, being
delighted with the sudden change of the noise and hurry of war to
stillness and repose.&nbsp; When the pleasure of novelty went
away, I employed my hours in examining the plants which grow in
the valley, and the minerals which I collected from the
rocks.&nbsp; But that inquiry is now grown tasteless and
irksome.&nbsp; I have been for some time unsettled and
distracted: my mind is disturbed with a thousand perplexities of
doubt and vanities of imagination, which hourly prevail upon me,
because I have no opportunities of relaxation or diversion.&nbsp;
I am sometimes ashamed to think that I could not secure myself
from vice but by retiring from the exercise of virtue, and begin
to suspect that I was rather impelled by resentment than led by
devotion into solitude.&nbsp; My fancy riots in scenes of folly,
and I lament that I have lost so much, and have gained so
little.&nbsp; In solitude, if I escape the example of bad men, I
want likewise the counsel and conversation of the good.&nbsp; I
have been long comparing the evils with <span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the
advantages of society, and resolve to return into the world
to-morrow.&nbsp; The life of a solitary man will be certainly
miserable, but not certainly devout.?</p><br>
<p>They heard his resolution with surprise, but after a short
pause offered to conduct him to Cairo.&nbsp; He dug up a
considerable treasure which he had hid among the rocks, and
accompanied them to the city, on which, as he approached it, he
gazed with rapture.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br>
THE HAPPINESS OF A LIFE LED ACCORDING TO NATURE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Rasselas</span> went often to an assembly
of learned men, who met at stated times to unbend their minds and
compare their opinions.&nbsp; Their manners were somewhat coarse,
but their conversation was instructive, and their disputations
acute, though sometimes too violent, and often continued till
neither controvertist remembered upon what question he
began.&nbsp; Some faults were almost general among them: every
one was pleased to hear the genius or knowledge of another
depreciated.</p><br>
<p>In this assembly Rasselas was relating his interview with the
hermit, and the wonder with which he heard him censure a course
of life which he had so deliberately chosen and so laudably
followed.&nbsp; The sentiments of the hearers were various.&nbsp;
Some were of opinion that the folly of his choice had been justly
punished by condemnation to perpetual perseverance.&nbsp; One of
the youngest among them, with great vehemence, pronounced him a
hypocrite.&nbsp; Some talked of the right of society to the
labour of individuals, and considered retirement as a desertion
of duty.&nbsp; Others readily allowed that there was a time when
the claims of the public were satisfied, and when a man might
properly sequester himself, to review his life and purify his
heart.</p><br>
<p>One who appeared more affected with the narrative than the
rest thought it likely that the hermit would in a few years go
back to his retreat, and perhaps, if shame did not restrain or
death intercept him, return once more from his retreat into the
world.&nbsp; ?For the hope of happiness,? said he,
?is so strongly impressed that the longest experience is
not able to efface it.&nbsp; Of the present state, whatever it
be, we feel and are forced to confess the misery; yet when the
same state is again at a distance, imagination paints it as
desirable.&nbsp; But the time will surely come when desire will
no longer be our torment and no man shall be wretched but by his
own fault.</p><br>
<p>?This,? said a philosopher who had heard him with
tokens of great impatience, ?is the present condition of a
wise man.&nbsp; The time is already come when none are wretched
but by their own fault.&nbsp; Nothing is more idle than to
inquire after happiness which Nature has kindly placed within our
reach.&nbsp; The way to be happy is to live according to Nature,
in obedience to that universal and unalterable law with which
every heart is originally impressed; which is not written on it
by precept, but engraven by destiny; not instilled by education,
but infused at our nativity.&nbsp; He that lives according to
Nature will suffer nothing from the delusions of hope or
importunities of desire; he will receive and reject with
equability of temper; and act or suffer as the reason of things
shall alternately prescribe.&nbsp; Other men may amuse themselves
with subtle definitions or intricate ratiocination.&nbsp; Let
them learn to be wise by easier means: let them observe the hind
of the forest and the linnet of the grove: let them consider the
life of animals, whose motions are regulated by instinct; they
obey their guide, and are happy.&nbsp; Let us therefore at length
cease to dispute, and learn to live: throw away the encumbrance
of precepts, which they who utter them with so much pride and
pomp do not understand, and carry with us this simple and
intelligible maxim: that deviation from Nature is deviation from
happiness.?</p><br>
<p>When he had spoken he looked round him with a placid air, and
enjoyed the consciousness of his own beneficence.</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? said the Prince with great modesty,
?as I, like all the rest of mankind, am desirous of
felicity, my closest attention has been fixed upon your
discourse: I doubt not the truth of a position which a man so
learned has so confidently advanced.&nbsp; Let me only know what
it is to live according to Nature.?</p><br>
<p>?When I find young men so humble and so docile,?
said the philosopher, ?I can deny them no information which
my studies have enabled me to afford.&nbsp; To live according to
Nature is to act always with due regard to the fitness arising
from the relations and qualities of causes and effects; to concur
with the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity; to
co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of the
present system of things.?</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>The
Prince soon found that this was one of the sages whom he should
understand less as he heard him longer.&nbsp; He therefore bowed
and was silent; and the philosopher, supposing him satisfied and
the rest vanquished, rose up and departed with the air of a man
that had co-operated with the present system.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br>
THE PRINCE AND HIS SISTER DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM THE WORK OF
OBSERVATION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Rasselas</span> returned home full of
reflections, doubting how to direct his future steps.&nbsp; Of
the way to happiness he found the learned and simple equally
ignorant; but as he was yet young, he flattered himself that he
had time remaining for more experiments and further
inquiries.&nbsp; He communicated to Imlac his observations and
his doubts, but was answered by him with new doubts and remarks
that gave him no comfort.&nbsp; He therefore discoursed more
frequently and freely with his sister, who had yet the same hope
with himself, and always assisted him to give some reason why,
though he had been hitherto frustrated, he might succeed at
last.</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>?We have hitherto,? said she, ?known
but little of the world; we have never yet been either great or
mean.&nbsp; In our own country, though we had royalty, we had no
power; and in this we have not yet seen the private recesses of
domestic peace.&nbsp; Imlac favours not our search, lest we
should in time find him mistaken.&nbsp; We will divide the task
between us; you shall try what is to be found in the splendour of
Courts, and I will range the shades of humbler life.&nbsp;
Perhaps command and authority may be the supreme blessings, as
they afford the most opportunities of doing good; or perhaps what
this world can give may be found in the modest habitations of
middle fortune?too low for great designs, and too high for
penury and distress.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br>
THE PRINCE EXAMINES THE HAPPINESS OF HIGH STATIONS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Rasselas</span> applauded the design, and
appeared next day with a splendid retinue at the Court of the
Bassa.&nbsp; He was soon distinguished for his magnificence, and
admitted, as a Prince whose curiosity had brought him from
distant countries, to an intimacy with the great officers and
frequent conversation with the Bassa himself.</p><br>
<p>He was at first inclined to believe that the man must be
pleased with his own condition whom all approached with reverence
and heard with obedience, and who had the power to extend his
edicts to a whole kingdom.&nbsp; ?There can be no
pleasure,? said he, ?equal to that of feeling at once
the joy of thousands all made happy by wise administration.&nbsp;
Yet, since by the law of subordination this sublime delight can
be in one nation but the lot of one, it is surely reasonable to
think that there is some satisfaction more popular and
accessible, and that millions can hardly be subjected to the will
of a single man, only to fill his particular breast with
incommunicable content.?</p><br>
<p>These thoughts were often in his mind, and he found no
solution of the difficulty.&nbsp; But as presents and civilities
gained him more familiarity, he found that almost every man who
stood high in his employment hated all the rest and was hated by
them, and that their lives were a continual succession of plots
and detections, stratagems and escapes, faction and
treachery.&nbsp; Many of those who surrounded the Bassa were sent
only to watch and <span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>report his conduct: every tongue was muttering censure,
and every eye was searching for a fault.</p><br>
<p>At last the letters of revocation arrived: the Bassa was
carried in chains to Constantinople, and his name was mentioned
no more.</p><br>
<p>?What are we now to think of the prerogatives of
power?? said Rasselas to his sister: ?is it without
efficacy to good, or is the subordinate degree only dangerous,
and the supreme safe and glorious?&nbsp; Is the Sultan the only
happy man in his dominions, or is the Sultan himself subject to
the torments of suspicion and the dread of enemies??</p><br>
<p>In a short time the second Bassa was deposed.&nbsp; The Sultan
that had advanced him was murdered by the Janissaries, and his
successor had other views or different favourites.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br>
THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN
SUCCESS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Princess in the meantime
insinuated herself into many families; for there are few doors
through which liberality, joined with good humour, cannot find
its way.&nbsp; The daughters of many houses were airy and
cheerful; but Nekayah had been too long accustomed to the
conversation of Imlac and her brother to be much pleased with
childish levity and prattle which had no meaning.&nbsp; She found
their thoughts narrow, their wishes low, and their merriment
often artificial.&nbsp; Their pleasures, poor as they were, could
not be preserved pure, but were embittered by petty competitions
and worthless emulation.&nbsp; They were always jealous of the
beauty of each other, of a quality to which solicitude can add
nothing, and from which detraction can take nothing away.&nbsp;
Many were in love with triflers like themselves, and many fancied
that they were in love when in truth they were only idle.&nbsp;
Their affection was not fixed on sense or virtue, and therefore
seldom ended but in vexation.&nbsp; Their grief, however, like
their joy, was transient; everything floated in their mind
unconnected with the past or future, so that one desire easily
gave way to another, as a second stone, cast into the water,
effaces and confounds the circles of the first.</p><br>
<p>With these girls she played as with inoffensive animals, and
found them proud of her countenance and weary of her company.</p><br>
<p>But her purpose was to examine more deeply, and her affability
easily persuaded the hearts that were swelling with sorrow to
discharge their secrets in her ear, and those whom hope flattered
or prosperity delighted often courted her to partake their
pleasure.</p><br>
<p>The Princess and her brother commonly met in the evening in a
private summerhouse on the banks of the Nile, and related to each
other the occurrences of the day.&nbsp; As they were sitting
together the Princess cast her eyes upon the river that flowed
before her.&nbsp; ?Answer,? said she, ?great
father of waters, thou that rollest thy goods through eighty
nations, to the invocations of the daughter of thy native
king.&nbsp; Tell me if thou waterest through all thy course a
single habitation from which thou dost not hear the murmurs of
complaint.?</p><br>
<p>?You are then,? said Rasselas, ?not more
successful in private houses than I have been in
Courts.?&nbsp; ?I have, since the last partition of
our provinces,? said the Princess, ?enabled myself to
enter familiarly into many families, where there was the fairest
show of prosperity and peace, and know not one house that is not
haunted by some fury that destroys their quiet.</p><br>
<p>?I did not seek ease among the poor, because I concluded
that there it could not be found.&nbsp; But I saw many poor whom
I had supposed to live in affluence.&nbsp; Poverty has in large
cities very different appearances.&nbsp; It is often concealed in
splendour and often in extravagance.&nbsp; It is the care of a
very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the
rest.&nbsp; They support themselves by temporary expedients, and
every day is lost in contriving for the morrow.</p><br>
<p>?This, however, was an evil which, though frequent, I
saw with less pain, because I could relieve it.&nbsp; Yet some
have refused my bounties; more offended with my quickness to
detect their wants than pleased with my readiness to succour
them; and others, whose exigencies compelled them to admit my
kindness, have never been able to forgive their
benefactress.&nbsp; Many, however, have been sincerely grateful
without the ostentation of gratitude or the hope of other
favours.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br>
THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nekayah</span>, perceiving her
brother?s attention fixed, proceeded in her narrative.</p><br>
<p>?In families where there is or is not poverty there is
commonly discord.&nbsp; If a kingdom be, as Imlac tells us, a
great family, a family likewise is a little kingdom, torn with
factions and exposed to revolutions.&nbsp; An unpractised
observer expects the love of parents and children to be constant
and equal.&nbsp; But this kindness seldom continues beyond the
years of infancy; in a short time the children become rivals to
their parents.&nbsp; Benefits are allowed by reproaches, and
gratitude debased by envy.</p><br>
<p>?Parents and children seldom act in concert; each child
endeavours to appropriate the esteem or the fondness of the
parents; and the parents, with yet less temptation, betray each
other to their children.&nbsp; Thus, some place their confidence
in the father and some in the mother, and by degrees the house is
filled with artifices and feuds.</p><br>
<p>?The opinions of children and parents, of the young and
the old, are naturally opposite, by the contrary effects of hope
and despondency, of expectation and experience, without crime or
folly on either side.&nbsp; The colours of life in youth and age
appear different, as the face of Nature in spring and
winter.&nbsp; And how can children credit the assertions of
parents which their own eyes show them to be false?</p><br>
<p>?Few parents act in such a manner as much to enforce
their maxims by the credit of their lives.&nbsp; The old man
trusts wholly to slow contrivance and gradual progression; the
youth expects to force his way by genius, vigour, and
precipitance.&nbsp; The old man pays regard to riches, and the
youth reverences virtue.&nbsp; The old man deifies prudence; the
youth commits himself to magnanimity and chance.&nbsp; The young
man, who intends no ill, believes that none is intended, and
therefore acts with openness and candour; but his father; having
suffered the injuries of fraud, is impelled to suspect and too
often allured to practise it.&nbsp; Age looks with anger on the
temerity of youth, and youth with contempt on the scrupulosity of
age.&nbsp; Thus parents and children for the greatest part live
on to love less and less; and if those whom Nature has thus
closely united are the torments of each other, where shall we
look for tenderness and consolations??</p><br>
<p>?Surely,? said the Prince, ?you must have
been unfortunate in your choice of acquaintance.&nbsp; I am
unwilling to believe that the most tender of all relations is
thus impeded in its effects by natural necessity.?</p><br>
<p>?Domestic discord,? answered she, ?is not
inevitably and fatally necessary, but yet it is not easily
avoided.&nbsp; We seldom see that a whole family is virtuous; the
good and the evil cannot well agree, and the evil can yet less
agree with one another.&nbsp; Even the virtuous fall sometimes to
variance, when their virtues are of different kinds and tending
to extremes.&nbsp; In general, those parents have most reverence
who most deserve it, for he that lives well cannot be
despised.</p><br>
<p>?Many other evils infest private life.&nbsp; Some are
the slaves of servants whom they have trusted with their
affairs.&nbsp; Some are kept in continual anxiety by the caprice
of rich relations, whom they cannot please and dare not
offend.&nbsp; Some husbands are imperious and some wives
perverse, and, as it is always more easy to do evil than good,
though the wisdom or virtue of one can very rarely make many
happy, the folly or vice of one makes many miserable.?</p><br>
<p>?If such be the general effect of marriage,? said
the Prince, ?I shall for the future think it dangerous to
connect my interest with that of another, lest I should be
unhappy by my partner?s fault.?</p><br>
<p>?I have met,? said the Princess, ?with many
who live single for that reason, but I never found that their
prudence ought to raise envy.&nbsp; They dream away their time
without friendship, without fondness, and are driven to rid
themselves of the day, for which they have no use, by childish
amusements or vicious delights.&nbsp; They act as beings under
the constant sense of some known inferiority that fills their
minds with rancour and their tongues with censure.&nbsp; They are
peevish at home and malevolent abroad, and, as the outlaws of
human nature, make it their business and their pleasure to
disturb that society which debars them from its privileges.&nbsp;
To live without feeling or exciting sympathy, to be fortunate
without adding to the felicity of others, or afflicted without
tasting the balm of pity, is a state more gloomy than solitude;
it is not retreat but exclusion from mankind.&nbsp; Marriage has
many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures.?</p><br>
<p>?What then is to be done?? said Rasselas.&nbsp;
?The more we inquire the less we can resolve.&nbsp; Surely
he is most likely to please himself that has no other inclination
to regard.?</p><br>

103</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br>
DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conversation had a short
pause.&nbsp; The Prince, having considered his sister?s
observation, told her that she had surveyed life with prejudice
and supposed misery where she did not find it.&nbsp; ?Your
narrative,? says he, ?throws yet a darker gloom upon
the prospects of futurity.&nbsp; The predictions of Imlac were
but faint sketches of the evils painted by Nekayah.&nbsp; I have
been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of grandeur
or of power; that her presence is not to be bought by wealth nor
enforced by conquest.&nbsp; It is evident that as any man acts in
a wider compass he must be more exposed to opposition from enmity
or miscarriage from chance.&nbsp; Whoever has many to please or
to govern must use the ministry of many agents, some of whom will
be wicked and some ignorant, by some he will be misled and by
others betrayed.&nbsp; If he gratifies one he will offend
another; those that are not favoured will think themselves
injured, and since favours can be conferred but upon few the
greater number will be always discontented.?</p><br>
<p>?The discontent,? said the Princess, ?which
is thus unreasonable, I hope that I shall always have spirit to
despise and you power to repress.?</p><br>
<p>?Discontent,? answered Rasselas, ?will not
always be without reason under the most just and vigilant
administration of public affairs.&nbsp; None, however attentive,
can always discover that merit which indigence or faction may
happen to obscure, and none, however powerful, can always reward
it.&nbsp; Yet he that sees inferior desert advanced above him
will naturally impute that preference to partiality or caprice,
and indeed it can scarcely be hoped that any man, however
magnanimous by Nature or exalted by condition, will be able to
persist for ever in fixed and inexorable justice of distribution;
he will sometimes indulge his own affections and sometimes those
of his favourites; he will permit some to please him who can
never serve him; he will discover in those whom he loves
qualities which in reality they do not possess, and to those from
whom he receives pleasure he will in his turn endeavour to give
it.&nbsp; Thus will recommendations sometimes prevail which were
purchased by money or by the more destructive bribery of flattery
and servility.</p><br>
<p>?He that hath much to do will do something wrong, and of
that wrong must suffer the consequences, and if it were possible
that he should always act rightly, yet, when such numbers are to
judge of his conduct, the bad will censure and obstruct him by
malevolence and the good sometimes by mistake.</p><br>
<p>?The highest stations cannot therefore hope to be the
abodes of happiness, which I would willingly believe to have fled
from thrones and palaces to seats of humble privacy and placid
obscurity.&nbsp; For what can hinder the satisfaction or
intercept the expectations of him whose abilities are adequate to
his employments, who sees with his own eyes the whole circuit of
his influence, who chooses by his own knowledge all whom he
trusts, and whom none are tempted to deceive by hope or
fear?&nbsp; Surely he has nothing to do but to love and to be
loved; to be virtuous and to be happy.?</p><br>
<p>?Whether perfect happiness would be procured by perfect
goodness,? said Nekayah, ?this world will never
afford an opportunity of deciding.&nbsp; But this, at least, may
be maintained, that we do not always find visible happiness in
proportion to visible virtue.&nbsp; All natural and almost all
political evils are incident alike to the bad and good; they are
confounded in the misery of a famine, and not much distinguished
in the fury of a faction; they <span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>sink together in a tempest and are
driven together from their country by invaders.&nbsp; All that
virtue can afford is quietness of conscience and a steady
prospect of a happier state; this may enable us to endure
calamity with patience, but remember that patience must oppose
pain.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br>
RASSELAS AND NEKAYAH CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">Dear</span> Princess,? said
Rasselas, ?you fall into the common errors of exaggeratory
declamation, by producing in a familiar disquisition examples of
national calamities and scenes of extensive misery which are
found in books rather than in the world, and which, as they are
horrid, are ordained to be rare.&nbsp; Let us not imagine evils
which we do not feel, nor injure life by
misrepresentations.&nbsp; I cannot bear that querulous eloquence
which threatens every city with a siege like that of Jerusalem,
that makes famine attend on every flight of locust, and suspends
pestilence on the wing of every blast that issues from the
south.</p><br>
<p>?On necessary and inevitable evils which overwhelm
kingdoms at once all disputation is vain; when they happen they
must be endured.&nbsp; But it is evident that these bursts of
universal distress are more dreaded than felt; thousands and tens
of thousands flourish in youth and wither in age, without the
knowledge of any other than domestic evils, and share the same
pleasures and vexations, whether their kings are mild or cruel,
whether the armies of their country pursue their enemies or
retreat before them.&nbsp; While Courts are disturbed with
intestine competitions and ambassadors are negotiating in foreign
countries, the smith still plies his anvil and the husbandman
drives his plough forward; the necessaries of life are required
and obtained, and the successive business of the season continues
to make its wonted revolutions.</p><br>
<p>?Let us cease to consider what perhaps may never happen,
and what, when it shall happen, will laugh at human
speculation.&nbsp; We will not endeavour to modify the motions of
the elements or to fix the destiny of kingdoms.&nbsp; It is our
business to consider what beings like us may perform, each
labouring for his own happiness by promoting within his circle,
however narrow, the happiness of others.</p><br>
<p>?Marriage is evidently the dictate of Nature; men and
women were made to be the companions of each other, and therefore
I cannot be persuaded but that marriage is one of the means of
happiness.?</p><br>
<p>?I know not,? said the Princess, ?whether
marriage be more than one of the innumerable modes of human
misery.&nbsp; When I see and reckon the various forms of
connubial infelicity, the unexpected causes of lasting discord,
the diversities of temper, the oppositions of opinion, the rude
collisions of contrary desire where both are urged by violent
impulses, the obstinate contest of disagreeing virtues where both
are supported by consciousness of good intention, I am sometimes
disposed to think, with the severer casuists of most nations,
that marriage is rather permitted than approved, and that none,
but by the instigation of a passion too much indulged, entangle
themselves with indissoluble compact.?</p><br>
<p>?You seem to forget,? replied Rasselas,
?that you have, even now represented celibacy as less happy
than marriage.&nbsp; Both conditions may be bad, but they cannot
both be worse.&nbsp; Thus it happens, when wrong opinions are
entertained, that they mutually destroy each other and leave the
mind open to truth.?</p><br>
<p>?I did not expect,? answered, the Princess,
?to hear that imputed to falsehood which is the consequence
only of frailty.&nbsp; To the mind, as to the eye, it is
difficult to compare with exactness objects vast in their extent
and various in their parts.&nbsp; When we see or conceive the
whole at once, we readily note the discriminations and decide the
preference, but of two systems, of which neither can be surveyed
by any human being in its full compass of magnitude and
multiplicity of complication, where is the wonder that, judging
of the whole by parts, I am alternately affected by one and the
other as either presses on my memory or fancy?&nbsp; We differ
from ourselves just as we differ from each other when we see only
part of the question, as in the multifarious relations of
politics and morality, but when we perceive the whole at once, as
in numerical computations, all agree in one judgment, and none
ever varies in his opinion.?</p><br>
<p>?Let us not add,? said the Prince, ?to the
other evils of life the bitterness of controversy, nor endeavour
to vie with each other in subtilties of argument.&nbsp; We are
employed in a search of which both are equally to enjoy the
success or suffer by the miscarriage; it is therefore fit that we
assist each other.&nbsp; You surely conclude too hastily from the
infelicity of marriage against its institution; <span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>will not
the misery of life prove equally that life cannot be the gift of
Heaven?&nbsp; The world must be peopled by marriage or peopled
without it.?</p><br>
<p>?How the world is to be peopled,? returned
Nekayah, ?is not my care and need not be yours.&nbsp; I see
no danger that the present generation should omit to leave
successors behind them; we are not now inquiring for the world,
but for ourselves.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br>
THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE (<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">The</span> good of the
whole,? says Rasselas, ?is the same with the good of
all its parts.&nbsp; If marriage be best for mankind, it must be
evidently best for individuals; or a permanent and necessary duty
must be the cause of evil, and some must be inevitably sacrificed
to the convenience of others.&nbsp; In the estimate which you
have made of the two states, it appears that the incommodities of
a single life are in a great measure necessary and certain, but
those of the conjugal state accidental and avoidable.&nbsp; I
cannot forbear to flatter myself that prudence and benevolence
will make marriage happy.&nbsp; The general folly of mankind is
the cause of general complaint.&nbsp; What can be expected but
disappointment and repentance from a choice made in the
immaturity of youth, in the ardour of desire, without judgment,
without foresight, without inquiry after conformity of opinions,
similarity of manners, rectitude of judgment, or purity of
sentiment?</p><br>
<p>?Such is the common process of marriage.&nbsp; A youth
and maiden, meeting by chance or brought together by artifice,
exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, go home and dream of
one another.&nbsp; Having little to divert attention or diversify
thought, they find themselves uneasy when they are apart, and
therefore conclude that they shall be happy together.&nbsp; They
marry, and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness before
had concealed; they wear out life in altercations, and charge
Nature with cruelty.</p><br>
<p>?From those early marriages proceeds likewise the
rivalry of parents and children: the son is eager to enjoy the
world before the father is willing to forsake it, and there is
hardly room at once for two generations.&nbsp; The daughter
begins to bloom before the mother can be content to fade, and
neither can forbear to wish for the absence of the other.</p><br>
<p>?Surely all these evils may be avoided by that
deliberation and delay which prudence prescribes to irrevocable
choice.&nbsp; In the variety and jollity of youthful pleasures,
life may be well enough supported without the help of a
partner.&nbsp; Longer time will increase experience, and wider
views will allow better opportunities of inquiry and selection;
one advantage at least will be certain, the parents will be
visibly older than their children.?</p><br>
<p>?What reason cannot collect,? and Nekayah,
?and what experiment has not yet taught, can be known only
from the report of others.&nbsp; I have been told that late
marriages are not eminently happy.&nbsp; This is a question too
important to be neglected; and I have often proposed it to those
whose accuracy of remark and comprehensiveness of knowledge made
their suffrages worthy of regard.&nbsp; They have generally
determined that it is dangerous for a man and woman to suspend
their fate upon each other at a time when opinions are fixed and
habits are established, when friendships have been contracted on
both sides, when life has been planned into method, and the mind
has long enjoyed the contemplation of its own prospects.</p><br>
<p>?It is scarcely possible that two travelling through the
world under the conduct of chance should have been both directed
to the same path, and it will not often happen that either will
quit the track which custom has made pleasing.&nbsp; When the
desultory levity of youth has settled into regularity, it is soon
succeeded by pride ashamed to yield, or obstinacy delighting to
contend.&nbsp; And even though mutual esteem produces mutual
desire to please, time itself, as it modifies unchangeably the
external mien, determines likewise the direction of the passions,
and gives an inflexible rigidity to the manners.&nbsp; Long
customs are not easily broken; he that attempts to change the
course of his own life very often labours in vain, and how shall
we do that for others which we are seldom able to do for
ourselves??</p><br>
<p>?But surely,? interposed the Prince, ?you
suppose the chief motive of choice forgotten or neglected.&nbsp;
Whenever I shall seek a wife, it shall be my first question
whether she be willing to be led by reason.?</p><br>
<p>?Thus it is,? said Nekayah, ?that
philosophers are deceived.&nbsp; There are a thousand familiar
disputes which reason never can decide; questions that elude
investigation, and make logic ridiculous; cases where something
must be done, and where little can be said.&nbsp; Consider the
state of mankind, and inquire how few can be supposed to act upon
any occasions, whether small or great, with all the reasons of
action present to their minds.&nbsp; Wretched would be the pair,
above all names of wretchedness, who should be doomed to adjust
by reason every morning all the minute details of a domestic
day.</p><br>
<p>?Those who marry at an advanced age will probably escape
the encroachments of their children, but in the diminution of
this advantage they will be likely to leave them, ignorant and
helpless, to a guardian?s mercy; or if that should not
happen, they must at least go out of the world before they see
those whom they love best either wise or great.</p><br>
<p>?From their children, if they have less to fear, they
have less also to hope; and they lose without equivalent the joys
of early love, and the convenience of uniting with manners pliant
and minds susceptible of new impressions, which might wear away
their dissimilitudes by long cohabitation, as soft bodies by
continual attrition conform their surfaces to each other.</p><br>
<p>?I believe it will be found that those who marry late
are best pleased with their children, and those who marry early
with their partners.?</p><br>
<p>?The union of these two affections,? said
Rasselas, ?would produce all that could be wished.&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a time when marriage might unite them?a
time neither too early for the father nor too late for the
husband.?</p><br>
<p>?Every hour,? answered the Princess,
?confirms my prejudice in favour of the position so often
uttered by the mouth of Imlac, that ?Nature sets her gifts
on the right hand and on the left.?&nbsp; Those conditions
which flatter hope and attract desire are so constituted that as
we approach one we recede from another.&nbsp; There are goods so
opposed that we cannot seize both, but by too much prudence may
pass between them at too great a distance to reach either.&nbsp;
This is often the fate of long consideration; he does nothing who
endeavours to do more than is allowed to humanity.&nbsp; Flatter
not yourself with contrarieties of pleasure.&nbsp; Of the
blessings set before you make your choice, and be content.&nbsp;
No man can taste the fruits of autumn while he is delighting his
scent with the flowers of the spring; no man can at the same time
fill his cup from the source and from the mouth of the
Nile.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>CHAPTER XXX<br>
IMLAC ENTERS, AND CHANGES THE CONVERSATION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> Imlac entered, and interrupted
them.&nbsp; ?Imlac,? said Rasselas, ?I have
been taking from the Princess the dismal history of private life,
and am almost discouraged from further search.?</p><br>
<p>?It seems to me,? said Imlac, ?that while
you are making the choice of life you neglect to live.&nbsp; You
wander about a single city, which, however large and diversified,
can now afford few novelties, and forget that you are in a
country famous among the earliest monarchies for the power and
wisdom of its inhabitants?a country where the sciences
first dawned that illuminate the world, and beyond which the arts
cannot be traced of civil society or domestic life.</p><br>
<p>?The old Egyptians have left behind them monuments of
industry and power before which all European magnificence is
confessed to fade away.&nbsp; The ruins of their architecture are
the schools of modern builders; and from the wonders which time
has spared we may conjecture, though uncertainly, what it has
destroyed.?</p><br>
<p>?My curiosity,? said Rasselas, ?does not
very strongly lead me to survey piles of stone or mounds of
earth.&nbsp; My business is with man.&nbsp; I came hither not to
measure fragments of temples or trace choked aqueducts, but to
look upon the various scenes of the present world.?</p><br>
<p>?The things that are now before us,? said the
Princess, ?require attention, and deserve it.&nbsp; What
have I to do with the heroes or the monuments of ancient
times?with times which can never return, and heroes whose
form of life was different from all that the present condition of
mankind requires or allows??</p><br>
<p>?To know anything,? returned the poet, ?we
must know its effects; to see men, we must see their works, that
we may learn what reason has dictated or passion has excited, and
find what are the most powerful motives of action.&nbsp; To judge
rightly of the present, we must oppose it to the past; for all
judgment is comparative, and of the future nothing can be
known.&nbsp; The truth is that no mind is much employed upon the
present; recollection and anticipation fill up almost all our
moments.&nbsp; Our passions are joy and grief, love and hatred,
hope and fear.&nbsp; Of joy and grief, the past is the object,
and the future of hope and fear; even love and hatred respect the
past, for the cause must have been before the effect.</p><br>
<p>?The present state of things is the consequence of the
former; and it is natural to inquire what were the sources of the
good that we enjoy, or the evils that we suffer.&nbsp; If we act
only for ourselves, to neglect the study of history is not
prudent.&nbsp; If we are entrusted with the care of others, it is
not just.&nbsp; Ignorance, when it is voluntary, is criminal; and
he may properly be charged with evil who refused to learn how he
might prevent it.</p><br>
<p>?There is no part of history so generally useful as that
which relates to the progress of the human mind, the gradual
improvement of reason, the successive advances of science, the
vicissitudes of learning and ignorance (which are the light and
darkness of thinking beings), the extinction and resuscitation of
arts, and the revolutions of the intellectual world.&nbsp; If
accounts of battles and invasions are peculiarly the business of
princes, the useful or elegant arts are not to be neglected;
those who have kingdoms to govern have understandings to
cultivate.</p><br>
<p>?Example is always more efficacious than precept.&nbsp;
A soldier is formed in war, and a painter must copy
pictures.&nbsp; In this, contemplative life has the
advantage.&nbsp; Great actions are seldom seen, but the labours
of art are always at hand for those who desire to know what art
has been able to perform.</p><br>
<p>?When the eye or the imagination is struck with any
uncommon work, the next transition of an active mind is to the
means by which it was performed.&nbsp; Here begins the true use
of such contemplation.&nbsp; We enlarge our comprehension by new
ideas, and perhaps recover some art lost to mankind, or learn
what is less perfectly known in our own country.&nbsp; At least
we compare our own with former times, and either rejoice at our
improvements, or, what is the first motion towards good, discover
our defects.?</p><br>
<p>?I am willing,? said the Prince, ?to see all
that can deserve my search.?</p><br>
<p>?And I,? said the Princess, ?shall rejoice
to learn something of the manners of antiquity.?</p><br>
<p>?The most pompous monument of Egyptian greatness, and
one of the most bulky works of manual industry,? said
Imlac, ?are the Pyramids: fabrics raised before the time of
history, and of which the earliest narratives afford us only
uncertain traditions.&nbsp; Of these the greatest is still
standing, very little injured by time.?</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>?Let us visit them to-morrow,? said
Nekayah.&nbsp; ?I have often heard of the Pyramids, and
shall not rest till I have seen them, within and without, with my
own eyes.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br>
THEY VISIT THE PYRAMIDS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> resolution being thus taken,
they set out the next day.&nbsp; They laid tents upon their
camels, being resolved to stay among the Pyramids till their
curiosity was fully satisfied.&nbsp; They travelled gently,
turned aside to everything remarkable, stopped from time to time
and conversed with the inhabitants, and observed the various
appearances of towns ruined and inhabited, of wild and cultivated
nature.</p><br>
<p>When they came to the Great Pyramid they were astonished at
the extent of the base and the height of the top.&nbsp; Imlac
explained to them the principles upon which the pyramidal form
was chosen for a fabric intended to co-extend its duration with
that of the world: he showed that its gradual diminution gave it
such stability as defeated all the common attacks of the
elements, and could scarcely be overthrown by earthquakes
themselves, the least resistible of natural violence.&nbsp; A
concussion that should shatter the pyramid would threaten the
dissolution of the continent.</p><br>
<p>They measured all its dimensions, and pitched their tents at
its foot.&nbsp; Next day they prepared to enter its interior
apartments, and having hired the common guides, climbed up to the
first passage; when the favourite of the Princess, looking into
the cavity, stepped back and trembled.&nbsp;
?Pekuah,? said the Princess, ?of what art thou
afraid??</p><br>
<p>?Of the narrow entrance,? answered the lady,
?and of the dreadful gloom.&nbsp; I dare not enter a place
which must surely be inhabited by unquiet souls.&nbsp; The
original possessors of these dreadful vaults will start up before
us, and perhaps shut us in for ever.?&nbsp; She spoke, and
threw her arms round the neck of her mistress.</p><br>
<p>?If all your fear be of apparitions,? said the
Prince, ?I will promise you safety.&nbsp; There is no
danger from the dead: he that is once buried will be seen no
more.?</p><br>
<p>?That the dead are seen no more,? said Imlac,
?I will not undertake to maintain against the concurrent
and unvaried testimony of all ages and of all nations.&nbsp;
There is no people, rude or learned, among whom apparitions of
the dead are not related and believed.&nbsp; This opinion, which
perhaps prevails as far as human nature is diffused, could become
universal only by its truth: those that never heard of one
another would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but
experience can make credible.&nbsp; That it is doubted by single
cavillers can very little weaken the general evidence, and some
who deny it with their tongues confess it by their fears.</p><br>
<p>?Yet I do not mean to add new terrors to those which
have already seized upon Pekuah.&nbsp; There can be no reason why
spectres should haunt the Pyramid more than other places, or why
they should have power or will to hurt innocence and
purity.&nbsp; Our entrance is no violation of their privileges:
we can take nothing from them; how, then, can we offend
them??</p><br>
<p>?My dear Pekuah,? said the Princess, ?I will
always go before you, and Imlac shall follow you.&nbsp; Remember
that you are the companion of the Princess of
Abyssinia.?</p><br>
<p>?If the Princess is pleased that her servant should
die,? returned the lady, ?let her command some death
less dreadful than enclosure in this horrid cavern.&nbsp; You
know I dare not disobey you?<span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>I must go if you command me; but if
I once enter, I never shall come back.?</p><br>
<p>The Princess saw that her fear was too strong for
expostulation or reproof, and, embracing her, told her that she
should stay in the tent till their return.&nbsp; Pekuah was not
yet satisfied, but entreated the Princess not to pursue so
dreadful a purpose as that of entering the recesses of the
Pyramids.&nbsp; ?Though I cannot teach courage,? said
Nekayah, ?I must not learn cowardice, nor leave at last
undone what I came hither only to do.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br>
THEY ENTER THE PYRAMID.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Pekuah</span> descended to the tents, and
the rest entered the Pyramid.&nbsp; They passed through the
galleries, surveyed the vaults of marble, and examined the chest
in which the body of the founder is supposed to have been
deposited.&nbsp; They then sat down in one of the most spacious
chambers to rest awhile before they attempted to return.</p><br>
<p>?We have now,? said Imlac, ?gratified our
minds with an exact view of the greatest work of man, except the
wall of China.</p><br>
<p>?Of the wall it is very easy to assign the motive.&nbsp;
It secured a wealthy and timorous nation from the incursions of
barbarians, whose unskilfulness in the arts made it easier for
them to supply their wants by rapine than by industry, and who
from time to time poured in upon the inhabitants of peaceful
commerce as vultures descend upon domestic fowl.&nbsp; Their
celerity and fierceness made the wall necessary, and their
ignorance made it efficacious.</p><br>
<p>?But for the Pyramids, no reason has ever been given
adequate to the cost and labour of the work.&nbsp; The narrowness
of the chambers proves that it could afford no retreat from
enemies, and treasures might have been reposited at far less
expense with equal security.&nbsp; It seems to have been erected
only in compliance with that hunger of imagination which preys
incessantly upon life, and must be always appeased by some
employment.&nbsp; Those who have already all that they can enjoy
must enlarge their desires.&nbsp; He that has built for use till
use is supplied must begin to build for vanity, and extend his
plan to the utmost power of human performance that he may not be
soon reduced to form another wish.</p><br>
<p>?I consider this mighty structure as a monument of the
insufficiency of human enjoyments.&nbsp; A king <span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>whose power
is unlimited, and whose treasures surmount all real and imaginary
wants, is compelled to solace, by the erection of a pyramid, the
satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasures, and to amuse
the tediousness of declining life by seeing thousands labouring
without end, and one stone, for no purpose, laid upon
another.&nbsp; Whoever thou art that, not content with a moderate
condition, imaginest happiness in royal magnificence, and
dreamest that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty
with perpetual gratifications, survey the Pyramids, and confess
thy folly!?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br>
THE PRINCESS MEETS WITH AN UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> rose up, and returned through
the cavity at which they had entered; and the Princess prepared
for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths and costly
rooms, and of the different impressions which the varieties of
the way had made upon her.&nbsp; But when they came to their
train, they found every one silent and dejected: the men
discovered shame and fear in their countenances, and the women
were weeping in their tents.</p><br>
<p>What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but
immediately inquired.&nbsp; ?You had scarcely entered into
the Pyramid,? said one of the attendants, ?when a
troop of Arabs rushed upon us: we were too few to resist them,
and too slow to escape.&nbsp; They were about to search the
tents, set us on our camels, and drive us along before them, when
the approach of some Turkish horsemen put them to flight: but
they seized the Lady Pekuah with her two maids, and carried them
away: the Turks are now pursuing them by our instigation, but I
fear they will not be able to overtake them.?</p><br>
<p>The Princess was overpowered with surprise and grief.&nbsp;
Rasselas, in the first heat of his resentment, ordered his
servants to follow him, and prepared to pursue the robbers with
his sabre in his hand.&nbsp; ?Sir,? said Imlac,
?what can you hope from violence or valour?&nbsp; The Arabs
are mounted on horses trained to battle and retreat; we have only
beasts of burden.&nbsp; By leaving our present station we may
lose the Princess, but cannot hope to regain Pekuah.?</p><br>
<p>In a short time the Turks returned, having not been able to
reach the enemy.&nbsp; The Princess burst <span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>out into
new lamentations, and Rasselas could scarcely forbear to reproach
them with cowardice; but Imlac was of opinion that the escape of
the Arabs was no addition to their misfortune, for perhaps they
would have killed their captives rather than have resigned
them.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br>
THEY RETURN TO CAIRO WITHOUT PEKUAH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was nothing to be hoped from
longer stay.&nbsp; They returned to Cairo, repenting of their
curiosity, censuring the negligence of the government, lamenting
their own rashness, which had neglected to procure a guard,
imagining many expedients by which the loss of Pekuah might have
been prevented, and resolving to do something for her recovery,
though none could find anything proper to be done.</p><br>
<p>Nekayah retired to her chamber, where her women attempted to
comfort her by telling her that all had their troubles, and that
Lady Pekuah had enjoyed much happiness in the world for a long
time, and might reasonably expect a change of fortune.&nbsp; They
hoped that some good would befall her wheresoever she was, and
that their mistress would find another friend who might supply
her place.</p><br>
<p>The Princess made them no answer; and they continued the form
of condolence, not much grieved in their hearts that the
favourite was lost.</p><br>
<p>Next day the Prince presented to the Bassa a memorial of the
wrong which he had suffered, and a petition for redress.&nbsp;
The Bassa threatened to punish the robbers, but did not attempt
to catch them; nor indeed could any account or description be
given by which he might direct the pursuit.</p><br>
<p>It soon appeared that nothing would be done by
authority.&nbsp; Governors being accustomed to hear of more
crimes than they can punish, and more wrongs than they can
redress, set themselves at ease by indiscriminate negligence, and
presently forget the request when they lose sight of the
petitioner.</p><br>
<p>Imlac then endeavoured to gain some intelligence by private
agents.&nbsp; He found many who pretended to an exact knowledge
of all the haunts of the Arabs, and to regular correspondence
with their chiefs, and who readily undertook the recovery of
Pekuah.&nbsp; Of these, some were furnished with money for their
journey, and came back no more; some were liberally paid for
accounts which a few days discovered to be false.&nbsp; But the
Princess would not suffer any means, however improbable, to be
left untried.&nbsp; While she was doing something, she kept her
hope alive.&nbsp; As one expedient failed, another was suggested;
when one messenger returned unsuccessful, another was despatched
to a different quarter.</p><br>
<p>Two months had now passed, and of Pekuah nothing had been
heard; the hopes which they had endeavoured to raise in each
other grew more languid; and the Princess, when she saw nothing
more to be tried, sunk down inconsolable in hopeless
dejection.&nbsp; A thousand times she reproached herself with the
easy compliance by which she permitted her favourite to stay
behind her.&nbsp; ?Had not my fondness,? said she,
?lessened my authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk of her
terrors.&nbsp; She ought to have feared me more than
spectres.&nbsp; A severe look would have overpowered her; a
peremptory command would have compelled obedience.&nbsp; Why did
foolish indulgence prevail upon me?&nbsp; Why did I not speak,
and refuse to hear??</p><br>
<p>?Great Princess,? said Imlac, ?do not
reproach yourself for your virtue, or consider that as blameable
by which evil has accidentally been caused.&nbsp; Your tenderness
for the timidity of Pekuah was generous and kind.&nbsp; When we
act according to our duty, we commit the events to Him by whose
laws our actions are governed, and who will suffer none to be
finally punished for obedience.&nbsp; When, in prospect of some
good, whether natural or moral, we break the rules prescribed us,
we withdraw from the direction of superior wisdom, and take all
consequences upon ourselves.&nbsp; Man cannot so far know the
connection of causes and events as that he may venture to do
wrong in order to do right.&nbsp; When we pursue our end by
lawful means, we may always console our miscarriage by the hope
of future recompense.&nbsp; When we consult only our own policy,
and attempt to find a nearer way to good by over-leaping the
settled boundaries of right and wrong, we cannot be happy even by
success, because we cannot escape the consciousness of our fault;
but if we miscarry, the disappointment is irremediably
embittered.&nbsp; How comfortless is the sorrow of him who feels
at once the pangs of guilt and the vexation of calamity which
guilt has brought upon him!</p><br>
<p>?Consider, Princess, what would have been your condition
if the Lady Pekuah had entreated to accompany you, and, being
compelled to stay in the tents, had been carried away; or how
would you have borne the thought if you had forced her <span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>into the
Pyramid, and she had died before you in agonies of
terror??</p><br>
<p>?Had either happened,? said Nekayah, ?I
could not have endured life till now; I should have been tortured
to madness by the remembrance of such cruelty, or must have pined
away in abhorrence of myself.?</p><br>
<p>?This, at least,? said Imlac, ?is the
present reward of virtuous conduct, that no unlucky consequence
can oblige us to repent it.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br>
THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nekayah</span>, being thus reconciled to
herself, found that no evil is insupportable but that which is
accompanied with consciousness of wrong.&nbsp; She was from that
time delivered from the violence of tempestuous sorrow, and sunk
into silent pensiveness and gloomy tranquillity.&nbsp; She sat
from morning to evening recollecting all that had been done or
said by her Pekuah, treasured up with care every trifle on which
Pekuah had set an accidental value, and which might recall to
mind any little incident or careless conversation.&nbsp; The
sentiments of her whom she now expected to see no more were
treasured in her memory as rules of life, and she deliberated to
no other end than to conjecture on any occasion what would have
been the opinion and counsel of Pekuah.</p><br>
<p>The women by whom she was attended knew nothing of her real
condition, and therefore she could not talk to them but with
caution and reserve.&nbsp; She began to remit her curiosity,
having no great desire to collect notions which she had no
convenience of uttering.&nbsp; Rasselas endeavoured first to
comfort and afterwards to divert her; he hired musicians, to whom
she seemed to listen, but did not hear them; and procured masters
to instruct her in various arts, whose lectures, when they
visited her again, were again to be repeated.&nbsp; She had lost
her taste of pleasure and her ambition of excellence; and her
mind, though forced into short excursions, always recurred to the
image of her friend.</p><br>
<p>Imlac was every morning earnestly enjoined to renew his
inquiries, and was asked every night whether he had yet heard of
Pekuah; till, not being able to return the Princess the answer
that she desired, he was less and less willing to come into her
presence.&nbsp; She observed his backwardness, and commanded him
to attend her.&nbsp;&nbsp; ?You are not,? said she,
?to confound impatience with resentment, or to suppose that
I charge you with negligence because I repine at your
unsuccessfulness.&nbsp; I do not much wonder at your
absence.&nbsp; I know that the unhappy are never pleasing, and
that all naturally avoid the contagion of misery.&nbsp; To hear
complaints is wearisome alike to the wretched and the happy; for
who would cloud by adventitious grief the short gleams of gaiety
which life allows us, or who that is struggling under his own
evils will add to them the miseries of another?</p><br>
<p>?The time is at hand when none shall be disturbed any
longer by the sighs of Nekayah: my search after happiness is now
at an end.&nbsp; I am resolved to retire from the world, with all
its flatteries and deceits, and will hide myself in solitude,
without any other care than to compose my thoughts and regulate
my hours by a constant succession of innocent occupations, till,
with a mind purified from earthly desires, I shall enter into
that state to which all are hastening, and in which I hope again
to enjoy the friendship of Pekuah.?</p><br>
<p>?Do not entangle your mind,? said Imlac, ?by
irrevocable determinations, nor increase the burden of life by a
voluntary accumulation of misery.&nbsp; The weariness of
retirement will continue to increase when the loss of Pekuah is
forgot.&nbsp; That you have been deprived of one pleasure is no
very good reason for rejection of the rest.?</p><br>
<p>?Since Pekuah was taken from me,? said the
Princess, ?I have no pleasure to reject or to retain.&nbsp;
She that has no one to love or trust has little to hope.&nbsp;
She wants the radical principle of happiness.&nbsp; We may
perhaps allow that what satisfaction this world can afford must
arise from the conjunction of wealth, knowledge, and
goodness.&nbsp; Wealth is nothing but as it is bestowed, and
knowledge nothing but as it is communicated.&nbsp; They must
therefore be imparted to others, and to whom could I now delight
to impart them?&nbsp; Goodness affords the only comfort which can
be enjoyed without a partner, and goodness may be practised in
retirement.?</p><br>
<p>?How far solitude may admit goodness or advance it, I
shall not,? replied Imlac, ?dispute at present.&nbsp;
Remember the confession of the pious hermit.&nbsp; You will wish
to return into the world when the image of your companion has
left your thoughts.?</p><br>
<p>?That time,? said Nekayah, ?will never
come.&nbsp; The generous frankness, the modest obsequiousness,
and the faithful secrecy of my dear Pekuah will always be more
missed as I shall live longer to see vice and folly.?</p><br>
<p>?The state of a mind oppressed with a sudden
calamity,? said Imlac, ?is like that of the fabulous
inhabitants of the new-created earth, who, when the first night
came upon them, supposed that day would never return.&nbsp; When
the clouds of sorrow gather over us, we see nothing beyond them,
nor can imagine how they will be dispelled; yet a new day
succeeded to the night, and sorrow is never long without a dawn
of ease.&nbsp; But they who restrain themselves from receiving
comfort do as the savages would have done had they put out their
eyes when it was dark.&nbsp; Our minds, like our bodies, are in
continual flux; something is hourly lost, and something
acquired.&nbsp; To lose much at once is inconvenient to either,
but while the vital power remains uninjured, nature will find the
means of reparation.&nbsp; Distance has the same effect on the
mind as on the eye; and while we glide along the stream of time,
whatever we leave behind us is always lessening, and that which
we approach increasing in magnitude.&nbsp; Do not suffer life to
<span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>stagnate: it will grow muddy for want of motion; commit
yourself again to the current of the world; Pekuah will vanish by
degrees; you will meet in your way some other favourite, or learn
to diffuse yourself in general conversation.?</p><br>
<p>?At least,? said the Prince, ?do not despair
before all remedies have been tried.&nbsp; The inquiry after the
unfortunate lady is still continued, and shall be carried on with
yet greater diligence, on condition that you will promise to wait
a year for the event, without any unalterable
resolution.?</p><br>
<p>Nekayah thought this a reasonable demand, and made the promise
to her brother, who had been obliged by Imlac to require
it.&nbsp; Imlac had, indeed, no great hope of regaining Pekuah;
but he supposed that if he could secure the interval of a year,
the Princess would be then in no danger of a cloister.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI<br>
PEKUAH IS STILL REMEMBERED.&nbsp; THE PROGRESS OF SORROW.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nekayah</span>, seeing that nothing was
omitted for the recovery of her favourite, and having by her
promise set her intention of retirement at a distance, began
imperceptibly to return to common cares and common
pleasures.&nbsp; She rejoiced without her own consent at the
suspension of her sorrows, and sometimes caught herself with
indignation in the act of turning away her mind from the
remembrance of her whom yet she resolved never to forget.</p><br>
<p>She then appointed a certain hour of the day for meditation on
the merits and fondness of Pekuah, and for some weeks retired
constantly at the time fixed, and returned with her eyes swollen
and her countenance clouded.&nbsp; By degrees she grew less
scrupulous, and suffered any important and pressing avocation to
delay the tribute of daily tears.&nbsp; She then yielded to less
occasions, and sometimes forgot what she was indeed afraid to
remember, and at last wholly released herself from the duty of
periodical affliction.</p><br>
<p>Her real love of Pekuah was not yet diminished.&nbsp; A
thousand occurrences brought her back to memory, and a thousand
wants, which nothing but the confidence of friendship can supply,
made her frequently regretted.&nbsp; She therefore solicited
Imlac never to desist from inquiry, and to leave no art of
intelligence untried, that at least she might have the comfort of
knowing that she did not suffer by <span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>negligence or sluggishness.&nbsp;
?Yet what,? said she, ?is to be expected from
our pursuit of happiness, when we find the state of life to be
such that happiness itself is the cause of misery?&nbsp; Why
should we endeavour to attain that of which the possession cannot
be secured?&nbsp; I shall henceforward fear to yield my heart to
excellence, however bright, or to fondness, however tender, lest
I should lose again what I have lost in Pekuah.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII<br>
THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> seven mouths one of the
messengers who had been sent away upon the day when the promise
was drawn from the Princess, returned, after many unsuccessful
rambles, from the borders of Nubia, with an account that Pekuah
was in the hands of an Arab chief, who possessed a castle or
fortress on the extremity of Egypt.&nbsp; The Arab, whose revenue
was plunder, was willing to restore her, with her two attendants,
for two hundred ounces of gold.</p><br>
<p>The price was no subject of debate.&nbsp; The Princess was in
ecstasies when she heard that her favourite was alive, and might
so cheaply be ransomed.&nbsp; She could not think of delaying for
a moment Pekuah?s happiness or her own, but entreated her
brother to send back the messenger with the sum required.&nbsp;
Imlac, being consulted, was not very confident of the veracity of
the relater, and was still more doubtful of the Arab?s
faith, who might, if he were too liberally trusted, detain at
once the money and the captives.&nbsp; He thought it dangerous to
put themselves in the power of the Arab by going into his
district; and could not expect that the rover would so much
expose himself as to come into the lower country, where he might
be seized by the forces of the Bassa.</p><br>
<p>It is difficult to negotiate where neither will trust.&nbsp;
But Imlac, after some deliberation, directed the messenger to
propose that Pekuah should be conducted by ten horsemen to the
monastery of St. Anthony, which is situated in the deserts of
Upper Egypt, where she should be met by the same number, and her
ransom should be paid.</p><br>
<p>That no time might be lost, as they expected that the proposal
would not be refused, they immediately began their journey to the
monastery; and when they arrived, Imlac went forward with the
former messenger to the Arab?s fortress.&nbsp; Rasselas was
desirous to go with them; but neither his sister nor Imlac would
consent.&nbsp; The Arab, according to the custom of his nation,
observed the laws of hospitality with great exactness to those
who put themselves into his power, and in a few days brought
Pekuah, with her maids, by easy journeys, to the place appointed,
where, receiving the stipulated price, he restored her, with
great respect, to liberty and her friends, and undertook to
conduct them back towards Cairo beyond all danger of robbery or
violence.</p><br>
<p>The Princess and her favourite embraced each other with
transport too violent to be expressed, and went out together to
pour the tears of tenderness in secret, and exchange professions
of kindness and gratitude.&nbsp; After a few hours they returned
into the refectory of the convent, where, in the presence of the
prior and his brethren, the Prince required of Pekuah the history
of her adventures.</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br>
THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">At</span> what time and in what
manner I was forced away,? said Pekuah, ?your
servants have told you.&nbsp; The suddenness of the event struck
me with surprise, and I was at first rather stupefied than
agitated with any passion of either fear or sorrow.&nbsp; My
confusion was increased by the speed and tumult of our flight,
while we were followed by the Turks, who, as it seemed, soon
despaired to overtake us, or were afraid of those whom they made
a show of menacing.</p><br>
<p>?When the Arabs saw themselves out of danger, they
slackened their course; and as I was less harassed by external
violence, I began to feel more uneasiness in my mind.&nbsp; After
some time we stopped near a spring shaded with trees, in a
pleasant meadow, where we were set upon the ground, and offered
such refreshments as our masters were partaking.&nbsp; I was
suffered to sit with my maids apart from the rest, and none
attempted to comfort or insult us.&nbsp; Here I first began to
feel the full weight of my misery.&nbsp; The girls sat weeping in
silence, and from time to time looked on me for succour.&nbsp; I
knew not to what condition we were doomed, nor could conjecture
where would be the place of our captivity, or whence to draw any
hope of deliverance.&nbsp; I was in the hands of robbers and
savages, and had no reason to suppose that their pity was more
than their justice, or that they would forbear the gratification
of any ardour of desire or caprice of cruelty.&nbsp; I, however,
kissed my maids, and endeavoured to pacify them by remarking that
we were yet treated with decency, and that since we were now
carried beyond pursuit, there was no danger of violence to our
lives.</p><br>
<p>?When we were to be set again on horseback, my maids
clung round me, and refused to be parted; but I commanded them
not to irritate those who had us in their power.&nbsp; We
travelled the remaining part of the day through an unfrequented
and pathless country, and came by moonlight to the side of a
hill, where the rest of the troop was stationed.&nbsp; Their
tents were pitched and their fires kindled, and our chief was
welcomed as a man much beloved by his dependents.</p><br>
<p>?We were received into a large tent, where we found
women who had attended their husbands in the expedition.&nbsp;
They set before us the supper which they had provided, and I ate
it rather to encourage my maids than to comply with any appetite
of my own.&nbsp; When the meat was taken away, they spread the
carpets for repose.&nbsp; I was weary, and hoped to find in sleep
that remission of distress which nature seldom denies.&nbsp;
Ordering myself, therefore, to be undressed, I observed that the
women looked very earnestly upon me, not expecting, I suppose, to
see me so submissively attended.&nbsp; When my upper vest was
taken off, they were apparently struck with the splendour of my
clothes, and one of them timorously laid her hand upon the
embroidery.&nbsp; She then went out, and in a short time came
back with another woman, who seemed to be of higher rank and
greater authority.&nbsp; She did, at her entrance, the usual act
of reverence, and, taking me by the hand placed me in a smaller
tent, spread with finer carpets, where I spent the night quietly
with my maids.</p><br>
<p>?In the morning, as I was sitting on the grass, the
chief of the troop came towards me.&nbsp; I rose up to receive
him, and he bowed with great respect.&nbsp; ?Illustrious
lady,? said he, ?my fortune is better than I had
presumed to hope: I am told by my women that I have a princess in
my camp.?&nbsp; ?Sir,? answered I, ?your
women have deceived themselves and you; I am not a princess, but
an unhappy stranger who intended soon to have left this country,
in which I am now to be imprisoned for ever.?&nbsp;
?Whoever or whencesoever you are,? returned the Arab,
?your dress and that of your servants show your rank to be
high and your wealth to be great.&nbsp; Why should you, who can
so easily procure your ransom, think yourself in danger of
perpetual captivity?&nbsp; The purpose of my incursions is to
increase my riches, or, more property, to gather tribute.&nbsp;
The sons of Ishmael are the natural and hereditary lords of this
part of the continent, which is usurped by late invaders and
low-born tyrants, from whom we are compelled to take by the sword
what is denied to justice.&nbsp; The violence of war admits no
distinction: the lance that is lifted at guilt and power will
sometimes fall on innocence and gentleness.?</p><br>
<p>??How little,? said I, ?did I expect
that yesterday it should have fallen upon me!?</p><br>
<p>??Misfortunes,? answered the Arab,
?should always be expected.&nbsp; If the eye of hostility
could learn reverence or pity, excellence like yours had been
exempt from injury.&nbsp; But the angels of affliction spread
their toils alike for the virtuous and the wicked, for the mighty
and the mean.&nbsp; Do not be disconsolate; I am not one of the
lawless and cruel rovers of the desert; I know the rules of civil
life; I will fix your ransom, give a passport to your messenger,
and perform my stipulation with nice punctuality.?</p><br>
<p>?You will easily believe that I was pleased with his
courtesy, and finding that his predominant passion was desire for
money, I began now to think my danger less, for I knew that no
sum would be thought too great for the release of Pekuah.&nbsp; I
told him that he should have no reason to charge me with
ingratitude if I was used with kindness, and that any ransom
which could be expected for a maid of common rank would be paid,
but that he must not persist to rate me as a princess.&nbsp; He
said he would consider what he should demand, and then, smiling,
bowed and retired.</p><br>
<p>?Soon after the women came about me, each contending to
be more officious than the other, and my maids themselves were
served with reverence.&nbsp; We travelled onward by short
journeys.&nbsp; On the fourth day the chief told me that my
ransom must be two hundred ounces of gold, which I not only
promised him, but told him that I would add fifty more if I and
my maids were honourably treated.</p><br>
<p>?I never knew the power of gold before.&nbsp; From that
time I was the leader of the troop.&nbsp; The march of every day
was longer or shorter as I commanded, and the tents were pitched
where I chose to rest.&nbsp; We now had camels and other
conveniences for travel; my own women were always at my side, and
I amused myself with observing the manners of the vagrant
nations, and with viewing remains of ancient edifices, with which
these deserted countries appear to have been in some distant age
lavishly embellished.</p><br>
<p>?The chief of the band was a man far from illiterate: he
was able to travel by the stars or the compass, and had marked in
his erratic expeditions such places as are most worthy the notice
of a passenger.&nbsp; He observed to me that buildings are always
best preserved in places little frequented and difficult of
access; for when once a country declines from its primitive
splendour, the more inhabitants are left, the quicker ruin will
be made.&nbsp; Walls supply stones more easily than quarries; and
palaces and temples will be demolished to make stables of granite
and cottages of porphyry.??</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>CHAPTER XXXIX<br>
THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH (<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">We</span> wandered about in this
manner for some weeks, either, as our chief pretended, for my
gratification, or, as I rather suspected, for some convenience of
his own.&nbsp; I endeavoured to appear contented where sullenness
and resentment would have been of no use, and that endeavour
conduced much to the calmness of my mind; but my heart was always
with Nekayah, and the troubles of the night much overbalanced the
amusements of the day.&nbsp; My women, who threw all their cares
upon their mistress, set their minds at ease from the time when
they saw me treated with respect, and gave themselves up to the
incidental alleviations of our fatigue without solicitude or
sorrow.&nbsp; I was pleased with their pleasure, and animated
with their confidence.&nbsp; My condition had lost much of its
terror, since I found that the Arab ranged the country merely to
get riches.&nbsp; Avarice is a uniform and tractable vice: other
intellectual distempers are different in different constitutions
of mind; that which soothes the pride of one will offend the
pride of another; but to the favour of the covetous there is a
ready way?bring money, and nothing is denied.</p><br>
<p>?At last we came to the dwelling of our chief; a strong
and spacious house, built with stone in an island of the Nile,
which lies, as I was told, under the tropic.&nbsp;
?Lady,? said the Arab, ?you shall rest after
your journey a few weeks in this place, where you are to consider
yourself as Sovereign.&nbsp; My occupation is war: I have
therefore chosen this obscure residence, from which I can issue
unexpected, and to which I can retire unpursued.&nbsp; You may
now repose in security: here are few pleasures, but here is no
danger.?&nbsp; He then led me into the inner apartments,
and seating me on the richest couch, bowed to the ground.</p><br>
<p>?His women, who considered me as a rival, looked on me
with malignity; but being soon informed that I was a great lady
detained only for my ransom, they began to vie with each other in
obsequiousness and reverence.</p><br>
<p>?Being again comforted with new assurances of speedy
liberty, I was for some days diverted from impatience by the
novelty of the place.&nbsp; The turrets overlooked the country to
a great distance, and afforded a view of many windings of the
stream.&nbsp; In the day I wandered from one place to another, as
the course of the sun varied the splendour of the prospect, and
saw many things which I had never seen before.&nbsp; The
crocodiles and river-horses are common in this unpeopled region;
and I often looked upon them with terror, though I knew they
could not hurt me.&nbsp; For some time I expected to see mermaids
and tritons, which, as Imlac has told me, the European travellers
have stationed in the Nile; but no such beings ever appeared, and
the Arab, when I inquired after them, laughed at my
credulity.</p><br>
<p>?At night the Arab always attended me to a tower set
apart for celestial observations, where he endeavoured to teach
me the names and courses of the stars.&nbsp; I had no great
inclination to this study; but an appearance of attention was
necessary to please my instructor, who valued himself for his
skill, and in a little while I found some employment requisite to
beguile the tediousness of time, which was to be passed always
amidst the same objects.&nbsp; I was weary of looking in the
morning on things from which I had turned away weary in the
evening: I therefore was at last willing to observe the stars
rather than do nothing, but could not always compose my thoughts,
and was very often thinking on Nekayah when others imagined me
contemplating the sky.&nbsp; Soon after, the Arab went upon
another expedition, and then my only pleasure was to talk with my
maids about the accident by which we were carried away, and the
happiness we should all enjoy at the end of our
captivity.?</p><br>
<p>?There were women in your Arab?s fortress,?
said the Princess; ?why did you not make them your
companions, enjoy their conversation, and partake their
diversions?&nbsp; In a place where they found business or
amusement, why should you alone sit corroded with idle
melancholy? or why could not you bear for a few months that
condition to which they were condemned for life??</p><br>
<p>?The diversions of the women,? answered Pekuah,
?were only childish play, by which the mind accustomed to
stronger operations could not be kept busy.&nbsp; I could do all
which they delighted in doing by powers merely sensitive, while
my intellectual faculties were flown to Cairo.&nbsp; They ran
from room to room, as a bird hops from wire to wire in his
cage.&nbsp; They danced for the sake of motion, as lambs frisk in
a meadow.&nbsp; One sometimes pretended to be hurt that the rest
might be alarmed, or hid herself that another might seek
her.&nbsp; Part of their time passed in watching the progress of
light bodies that floated on the river, and part in marking the
various forms into which clouds broke in the sky.</p><br>
<p>?Their business was only needlework, in which I and my
maids sometimes helped them; but you know that the mind will
easily straggle from the fingers, nor will you suspect that
captivity and absence from Nekayah could receive solace from
silken flowers.</p><br>
<p>?Nor was much satisfaction to be hoped from their
conversation: for of what could they be expected to talk?&nbsp;
They had seen nothing, for they had lived from early youth in
that narrow spot: of what they had not seen they could have no
knowledge, for they could not read.&nbsp; They had no idea but of
the few things that were within their view, and had hardly names
for anything but their clothes and their food.&nbsp; As I bore a
superior character, I was often called to terminate their
quarrels, which I decided as equitably as I could.&nbsp; If it
could have amused me to hear the complaints of each against the
rest, I might have been often detained by long stories; but the
motives of their animosity were so small that I could not listen
without interrupting the tale.?</p><br>
<p>?How,? said Rasselas, ?can the Arab, whom
you represented as a man of more than common accomplishments,
take any pleasure in his seraglio, when it is filled only with
women like these?&nbsp; Are they exquisitely
beautiful??</p><br>
<p>?They do not,? said Pekuah, ?want that
unaffecting and ignoble beauty which may subsist without
sprightliness or sublimity, without energy of thought or dignity
of virtue.&nbsp; But to a man like the Arab such beauty was only
a flower casually plucked and carelessly thrown away.&nbsp;
Whatever pleasures he might find among them, they were not those
of friendship or society.&nbsp; When they were playing about him
he looked on them with inattentive superiority; when they vied
for his regard he sometimes turned away disgusted.&nbsp; As they
had no knowledge, their talk could take nothing from the
tediousness of life; as they had no choice, their fondness, or
appearance of fondness, excited in him neither pride nor
gratitude.&nbsp; He was not exalted in his own esteem by the
smiles of a woman who saw no other man, nor was much obliged by
that regard of which he could never know the sincerity, and which
he might often perceive to be exerted not so much to delight him
as to pain a rival.&nbsp; That which he gave, and they received,
as love, was only a careless distribution of superfluous time,
such love as man can bestow upon that which he despises, such as
has neither hope nor fear, neither joy nor sorrow.?</p><br>
<p>?You have reason, lady, to think yourself happy,?
said Imlac, ?that you have been thus easily
dismissed.&nbsp; How could a mind, hungry for knowledge, be
willing, in an intellectual famine, to lose such a banquet as
Pekuah?s conversation??</p><br>
<p>?I am inclined to believe,? answered Pekuah,
?that he was for some time in suspense; for,
notwithstanding his promise, whenever I proposed to despatch a
messenger to Cairo he found some excuse for delay.&nbsp; While I
was detained in his house he made many incursions into the
neighbouring countries, and perhaps he would have refused to
discharge me had his plunder been equal to his wishes.&nbsp; He
returned always courteous, related his adventures, delighted to
hear my observations, and endeavoured to advance my acquaintance
with the stars.&nbsp; When I importuned him to send away my
letters, he soothed me with professions of honour and sincerity;
and when I could be no longer decently denied, put his troop
again in motion, and left me to govern in his absence.&nbsp; I
was much afflicted by this studied procrastination, and was
sometimes afraid that I should be forgotten; that you would leave
Cairo, and I must end my days in an island of the Nile.</p><br>
<p>?I grew at last hopeless and dejected, and cared so
little to entertain him, that he for a while more frequently
talked with my maids.&nbsp; That he should fall in love with them
or with me, might have been equally fatal, and I was not much
pleased with the growing friendship.&nbsp; My anxiety was not
long, for, as I recovered some degree of cheerfulness, he
returned to me, and I could not forbear to despise my former
uneasiness.</p><br>
<p>?He still delayed to send for my ransom, and would
perhaps never have determined had not your agent found his way to
him.&nbsp; The gold, which he would not fetch, he could not
reject when it was offered.&nbsp; He hastened to prepare for our
journey hither, like a man delivered from the pain of an
intestine conflict.&nbsp; I took leave of my companions in the
house, who dismissed me with cold indifference.?</p><br>
<p>Nekayah having heard her favourite?s relation, rose and
embraced her, and Rasselas gave her a hundred ounces of gold,
which she presented to the Arab for the fifty that were
promised.</p><br>

155</span>CHAPTER XL<br>
THE HISTORY OF A MAN OF LEARNING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> returned to Cairo, and were so
well pleased at finding themselves together that none of them
went much abroad.&nbsp; The Prince began to love learning, and
one day declared to Imlac that he intended to devote himself to
science and pass the rest of his days in literary solitude.</p><br>
<p>?Before you make your final choice,? answered
Imlac, ?you ought to examine its hazards, and converse with
some of those who are grown old in the company of
themselves.&nbsp; I have just left the observatory of one of the
most learned astronomers in the world, who has spent forty years
in unwearied attention to the motion and appearances of the
celestial bodies, and has drawn out his soul in endless
calculations.&nbsp; He admits a few friends once a month to hear
his deductions and enjoy his discoveries.&nbsp; I was introduced
as a man of knowledge worthy of his notice.&nbsp; Men of various
ideas and fluent conversation are commonly welcome to those whose
thoughts have been long fixed upon a single point, and who find
the images of other things stealing away.&nbsp; I delighted him
with my remarks.&nbsp; He smiled at the narrative of my travels,
and was glad to forget the constellations and descend for a
moment into the lower world.</p><br>
<p>?On the next day of vacation I renewed my visit, and was
so fortunate as to please him again.&nbsp; He relaxed from that
time the severity of his rule, and permitted me to enter at my
own choice.&nbsp; I found him always busy, and always glad to be
relieved.&nbsp; As each knew much which the other was desirous of
learning, we exchanged our notions with great delight.&nbsp; I
perceived that I had every day more of his confidence, and always
found new cause of admiration in the profundity of his
mind.&nbsp; His comprehension is vast, his memory capacious and
retentive, his discourse is methodical, and his expression
clear.</p><br>
<p>?His integrity and benevolence are equal to his
learning.&nbsp; His deepest researches and most favourite studies
are willingly interrupted for any opportunity of doing good by
his counsel or his riches.&nbsp; To his closest retreat, at his
most busy moments, all are admitted that want his assistance;
?For though I exclude idleness and pleasure, I will
never,? says he, ?bar my doors against charity.&nbsp;
To man is permitted the contemplation of the skies, but the
practice of virtue is commanded.??</p><br>
<p>?Surely,? said the Princess, ?this man is
happy.?</p><br>
<p>?I visited him,? said Imlac, ?with more and
more frequency, and was every time more enamoured of his
conversation; he was sublime without haughtiness, courteous
without formality, and communicative without ostentation.&nbsp; I
was at first, great Princess, of your opinion, thought him the
happiest of mankind, and often congratulated him on the blessing
that he enjoyed.&nbsp; He seemed to hear nothing with
indifference but the praises of his condition, to which he always
returned a general answer, and diverted the conversation to some
other topic.</p><br>
<p>?Amidst this willingness to be pleased and labour to
please, I had quickly reason to imagine that some painful
sentiment pressed upon his mind.&nbsp; He often looked up
earnestly towards the sun, and let his voice fall in the midst of
his discourse.&nbsp; He would sometimes, when we were alone, gaze
upon me in silence with the air of a man who longed to speak what
he was yet resolved to suppress.&nbsp; He would often send for me
with vehement injunction of haste, though when I came to him he
had nothing extraordinary to say; and sometimes, when I was
leaving him, would call me back, pause a few moments, and then
dismiss me.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>CHAPTER XLI<br>
THE ASTRONOMER DISCOVERS THE CAUSE OF HIS UNEASINESS.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">At</span> last the time came when
the secret burst his reserve.&nbsp; We were sitting together last
night in the turret of his house watching the immersion of a
satellite of Jupiter.&nbsp; A sudden tempest clouded the sky and
disappointed our observation.&nbsp; We sat awhile silent in the
dark, and then he addressed himself to me in these words:
?Imlac, I have long considered thy friendship as the
greatest blessing of my life.&nbsp; Integrity without knowledge
is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous
and dreadful.&nbsp; I have found in thee all the qualities
requisite for trust?benevolence, experience, and
fortitude.&nbsp; I have long discharged an office which I must
soon quit at the call of Nature, and shall rejoice in the hour of
imbecility and pain to devolve it upon thee.?</p><br>
<p>?I thought myself honoured by this testimony, and
protested that whatever could conduce to his happiness would add
likewise to mine.</p><br>
<p>??Hear, Imlac, what thou wilt not without
difficulty credit.&nbsp; I have possessed for five years the <span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>regulation
of the weather and the distribution of the seasons.&nbsp; The sun
has listened to my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by
my direction; the clouds at my call have poured their waters, and
the Nile has overflowed at my command.&nbsp; I have restrained
the rage of the dog-star, and mitigated the fervours of the
crab.&nbsp; The winds alone, of all the elemental powers, have
hitherto refused my authority, and multitudes have perished by
equinoctial tempests which I found myself unable to prohibit or
restrain.&nbsp; I have administered this great office with exact
justice, and made to the different nations of the earth an
impartial dividend of rain and sunshine.&nbsp; What must have
been the misery of half the globe if I had limited the clouds to
particular regions, or confined the sun to either side of the
equator???</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII<br>
THE OPINION OF THE ASTRONOMER IS EXPLAINED AND JUSTIFIED.</h2>
<p>?I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> he discovered in
me, through the obscurity of the room, some tokens of amazement
and doubt, for after a short pause he proceeded thus:?</p><br>
<p>??Not to be easily credited will neither surprise
nor offend me, for I am probably the first of human beings to
whom this trust has been imparted.&nbsp; Nor do I know whether to
deem this distinction a reward or punishment.&nbsp; Since I have
possessed it I have been far less happy than before, and nothing
but the consciousness of good intention could have enabled me to
support the weariness of unremitted vigilance.?</p><br>
<p>??How long, sir,? said I, ?has this
great office been in your hands??</p><br>
<p>??About ten years ago,? said he, ?my
daily observations of the changes of the sky led me to consider
whether, if I had the power of the seasons, I could confer
greater plenty upon the inhabitants of the earth.&nbsp; This
contemplation fastened on my mind, and I sat days and nights in
imaginary dominion, pouring upon this country and that the
showers of fertility, and seconding every fall of rain with a due
proportion of sunshine.&nbsp; I had yet only the will to do good,
and did not imagine that I should ever have the power.</p><br>
<p>??One day as I was looking on the fields withering
with heat, I felt in my mind a sudden wish that I could send rain
on the southern mountains, and raise the Nile to an
inundation.&nbsp; In the hurry of my imagination I commanded rain
to fall; and by comparing the time of my command with that of the
inundation, I found that the clouds had listened to my
lips.?</p><br>
<p>??Might not some other cause,? said I,
?produce this concurrence?&nbsp; The Nile does not always
rise on the same day.?</p><br>
<p>??Do not believe,? said he, with impatience,
?that such objections could escape me.&nbsp; I reasoned
long against my own conviction, and laboured against truth with
the utmost obstinacy.&nbsp; I sometimes suspected myself of
madness, and should not have dared to impart this secret but to a
man like you, capable of distinguishing the wonderful from the
impossible, and the incredible from the false.?</p><br>
<p>??Why, sir,? said I, ?do you call that
incredible which you know, or think you know, to be
true??</p><br>
<p>??Because,? said he, ?I cannot prove
it by any external evidence; and I know too well the laws of
demonstration to think that my conviction ought to influence
another, who cannot, like me, be conscious of its force.&nbsp; I
therefore shall not attempt to gain credit by disputation.&nbsp;
It is sufficient that I feel this power that I have long
possessed, and every day exerted it.&nbsp; But the life of man is
short; the infirmities of age increase <span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>upon me,
and the time will soon come when the regulator of the year must
mingle with the dust.&nbsp; The care of appointing a successor
has long disturbed me; the night and the day have been spent in
comparisons of all the characters which have come to my
knowledge, and I have yet found none so worthy as
thyself.??</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII<br>
THE ASTRONOMER LEAVES IMLAC HIS DIRECTIONS.</h2>
<p>??<span class="smcap">Hear</span>, therefore, what
I shall impart with attention, such as the welfare of a world
requires.&nbsp; If the task of a king be considered as difficult,
who has the care only of a few millions, to whom he cannot do
much good or harm, what must be the anxiety of him on whom
depends the action of the elements and the great gifts of light
and heat?&nbsp; Hear me, therefore, with attention.</p><br>
<p>??I have diligently considered the position of the
earth and sun, and formed innumerable schemes, in which I changed
their situation.&nbsp; I have sometimes turned aside the axis of
the earth, and sometimes varied the ecliptic of the sun, but I
have found it impossible to make a disposition by which the world
may be advantaged; what one region gains another loses by an
imaginable alteration, even without considering the distant parts
of the solar system with which we are acquainted.&nbsp; Do not,
therefore, in thy administration of the year, indulge thy pride
by innovation; do not please thyself with thinking that thou
canst make thyself renowned to all future ages by disordering the
seasons.&nbsp; The memory of mischief is no desirable fame.&nbsp;
Much less will it become thee to let kindness or interest
prevail.&nbsp; Never rob other countries of rain to pour it on
thine own.&nbsp; For us the Nile is sufficient.?</p><br>
<p>?I promised that when I possessed the power I would use
it with inflexible integrity; and he dismissed me, pressing my
hand.&nbsp; ?My heart,? said he, ?will be now
at rest, and my benevolence will no more destroy my quiet; I have
found a man of wisdom and virtue, to whom I can cheerfully
bequeath the inheritance of the sun.??</p><br>
<p>The Prince heard this narration with very serious regard; but
the Princess smiled, and Pekuah convulsed herself with
laughter.&nbsp; ?Ladies,? said Imlac, ?to mock
the heaviest of human afflictions is neither charitable nor
wise.&nbsp; Few can attain this man?s knowledge and few
practise his virtues, but all may suffer his calamity.&nbsp; Of
the uncertainties <span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>of our present state, the most dreadful and alarming is
the uncertain continuance of reason.?</p><br>
<p>The Princess was recollected, and the favourite was
abashed.&nbsp; Rasselas, more deeply affected, inquired of Imlac
whether he thought such maladies of the mind frequent, and how
they were contracted.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV<br>
THE DANGEROUS PREVALENCE OF IMAGINATION.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">Disorders</span> of
intellect,? answered Imlac, ?happen much more often
than superficial observers will easily believe.&nbsp; Perhaps if
we speak with rigorous exactness, no human mind is in its right
state.&nbsp; There is no man whose imagination does not sometimes
predominate over his reason who can regulate his attention wholly
by his will, and whose ideas will come and go at his
command.&nbsp; No man will be found in whose mind airy notions do
not sometimes tyrannise, and force him to hope or fear beyond the
limits of sober probability.&nbsp; All power of fancy over reason
is a degree of insanity, but while this power is such as we can
control and repress it is not visible to others, nor considered
as any deprivation of the mental faculties; it is not pronounced
madness but when it becomes ungovernable, and apparently
influences speech or action.</p><br>
<p>?To indulge the power of fiction and send imagination
out upon the wing is often the sport of those who delight too
much in silent speculation.&nbsp; When we are alone we are not
always busy; the labour of excogitation is too violent to last
long; the ardour of inquiry will sometimes give way to idleness
or satiety.&nbsp; He who has nothing external that can divert him
must find pleasure in his own thoughts, and must conceive himself
what he is not; for who is pleased with what he is?&nbsp; He then
expatiates in boundless futurity, and culls from all imaginable
conditions that which for the present moment he should most
desire, amuses his desires with impossible enjoyments, and
confers upon his pride unattainable dominion.&nbsp; The mind
dances from scene to scene, unites all pleasures in all
combinations, and riots in delights which Nature and fortune,
with all their bounty, cannot bestow.</p><br>
<p>?In time some particular train of ideas fixes the
attention; all other intellectual gratifications are rejected;
the mind, in weariness or leisure, recurs constantly to the
favourite conception, and feasts on the luscious falsehood
whenever she is offended with the bitterness of truth.&nbsp; By
degrees the reign of fancy is confirmed; she grows first
imperious and in time despotic.&nbsp; Then fictions begin to
operate as realities, false opinions fasten upon the mind, and
life passes in dreams of rapture or of anguish.</p><br>
<p>?This, sir, is one of the dangers of solitude, which the
hermit has confessed not always to promote goodness, and the
astronomer?s misery has proved to be not always propitious
to wisdom.?</p><br>
<p>?I will no more,? said the favourite,
?imagine myself the Queen of Abyssinia.&nbsp; I have often
spent the hours which the Princess gave to my own disposal in
adjusting ceremonies and regulating the Court; I have repressed
the pride of the powerful and granted the petitions of the poor;
I have built new palaces in more happy situations, planted groves
upon the tops of mountains, and have exulted in the beneficence
of royalty, till, when the Princess entered, I had almost
forgotten to bow down before her.?</p><br>
<p>?And I,? said the Princess, ?will not allow
myself any more to play the shepherdess in my waking
dreams.&nbsp; I have often soothed my thoughts with the quiet and
innocence of pastoral employments, till I have in my chamber
heard the winds whistle and the sheep bleat; sometimes freed the
lamb entangled in the thicket, and sometimes with my crook
encountered the wolf.&nbsp; I have a dress like that of the
village maids, which I put on to help my imagination, and a pipe
on which I play softly, and suppose myself followed by my
flocks.?</p><br>
<p>?I will confess,? said the Prince, ?an
indulgence of fantastic delight more dangerous than yours.&nbsp;
I have frequently endeavoured to imagine the possibility of a
perfect government, by which all wrong should be restrained, all
vice reformed, and all the subjects preserved in tranquillity and
innocence.&nbsp; This thought produced innumerable schemes of
reformation, and dictated many useful regulations and salutary
effects.&nbsp; This has been the sport and sometimes the labour
of my solitude, and I start when I think with how little anguish
I once supposed the death of my father and my
brothers.?</p><br>
<p>?Such,? said Imlac, ?are the effects of
visionary schemes.&nbsp; When we first form them, we know them to
be absurd, but familiarise them by degrees, and in time lose
sight of their folly.?</p><br>
<h2><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>CHAPTER XLV<br>
THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening was now far past, and
they rose to return home.&nbsp; As they walked along the banks of
the Nile, delighted with the beams of the moon quivering on the
water, they saw at a small distance an old man whom the Prince
had often heard in the assembly of the sages.&nbsp;
?Yonder,? said he, ?is one whose years have
calmed his passions, but not clouded his reason.&nbsp; Let us
close the disquisitions of the night by inquiring what are his
sentiments of his own state, that we may know whether youth alone
is to struggle with vexation, and whether any better hope remains
for the latter part of life.?</p><br>
<p>Here the sage approached and saluted them.&nbsp; They invited
him to join their walk, and prattled awhile as acquaintance that
had unexpectedly met one another.&nbsp; The old man was cheerful
and talkative, and the way seemed short in his company.&nbsp; He
was pleased to find himself not disregarded, accompanied them to
their house, and, at the Prince?s request, entered with
them.&nbsp; They placed him in the seat of honour, and set wine
and conserves before him.</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? said the Princess, ?an evening walk
must give to a man of learning like you pleasures which ignorance
and youth can hardly conceive.&nbsp; You know the qualities and
the causes of all that you behold?the laws by which the
river flows, the periods in which the planets perform their
revolutions.&nbsp; Everything must supply you with contemplation,
and renew the consciousness of your own dignity.?</p><br>
<p>?Lady,? answered he, ?let the gay and the
vigorous expect pleasure in their excursions: it is enough that
age can attain ease.&nbsp; To me the world has lost its
novelty.&nbsp; I look round, and see what I remember to have seen
in happier days.&nbsp; I rest against a tree, and consider that
in the same shade I once disputed upon the annual overflow of the
Nile with a friend who is now silent in the grave.&nbsp; I cast
my eyes upwards, fix them on the changing moon, and think with
pain on the vicissitudes of life.&nbsp; I have ceased to take
much delight in physical truth; for what have I to do with those
things which I am soon to leave??</p><br>
<p>?You may at least recreate yourself,? said Imlac,
?with the recollection of an honourable and useful life,
and enjoy the praise which all agree to give you.?</p><br>
<p>?Praise,? said the sage with a sigh, ?is to
an old man an empty sound.&nbsp; I have neither mother to be
delighted with the reputation of her son, nor wife to partake the
honours of her husband.&nbsp; I have outlived my friends and my
rivals.&nbsp; Nothing is now of much importance; for I cannot
extend my interest beyond myself.&nbsp; Youth is delighted with
applause, because it is considered as the earnest of some future
good, and because the prospect of life is far extended; but to
me, who am now declining to decrepitude, there is little to be
feared from the malevolence of men, and yet less to be hoped from
their affection or esteem.&nbsp; Something they may yet take
away, but they can give me nothing.&nbsp; Riches would now be
useless, and high employment would be pain.&nbsp; My retrospect
of life recalls to my view many opportunities of good neglected,
much time squandered upon trifles, and more lost in idleness and
vacancy.&nbsp; I leave many great designs unattempted, and many
great attempts unfinished.&nbsp; My mind is burdened with no
heavy crime, and therefore I compose myself to tranquillity;
endeavour to abstract my thoughts from hopes and cares which,
though reason knows them to be vain, still try to keep their old
possession of the heart; expect, with serene humility, that hour
which nature cannot long delay, and hope to possess in a better
state that happiness which here I could not find, and that virtue
which here I have not attained.?</p><br>
<p>He arose and went away, leaving his audience not much elated
with the hope of long life.&nbsp; The Prince consoled himself
with remarking that it was not reasonable to be disappointed by
this account; for age had never been considered as the season of
felicity, and if it was possible to be easy in decline and
weakness, it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity
might be happy; that the noon of life might be bright, if the
evening could be calm.</p><br>
<p>The Princess suspected that age was querulous and malignant,
and delighted to repress the expectations of those who had newly
entered the world.&nbsp; She had seen the possessors of estates
look with envy on their heirs, and known many who enjoyed
pleasures no longer than they could confine it to themselves.</p><br>
<p>Pekuah conjectured that the man was older than he appeared,
and was willing to impute his complaints to delirious dejection;
or else supposed that he had been unfortunate, and was therefore
discontented.&nbsp; ?For nothing,? said she,
?is more common than to call our own condition the
condition of life.?</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Imlac, who had no desire to see them depressed, smiled
at the comforts which they could so readily procure to
themselves; and remembered that at the same age he was equally
confident of unmingled prosperity, and equally fertile of
consolatory expedients.&nbsp; He forbore to force upon them
unwelcome knowledge, which time itself would too soon
impress.&nbsp; The Princess and her lady retired; the madness of
the astronomer hung upon their minds; and they desired Imlac to
enter upon his office, and delay next morning the rising of the
sun.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI<br>
THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Princess and Pekuah, having
talked in private of Imlac?s astronomer, thought his
character at once so amiable and so strange that they could not
be satisfied without a nearer knowledge, and Imlac was requested
to find the means of bringing them together.</p><br>
<p>This was somewhat difficult.&nbsp; The philosopher had never
received any visits from women, though he lived in a city that
had in it many Europeans, who followed the manners of their own
countries, and many from other parts of the world, that lived
there with European liberty.&nbsp; The ladies would not be
refused, and several schemes were proposed for the accomplishment
of their design.&nbsp; It was proposed to introduce them as
strangers in distress, to whom the sage was always accessible;
but after some deliberation it appeared that by this artifice no
acquaintance could be formed, for their conversation would be
short, and they could not decently importune him often.&nbsp;
?This,? said Rasselas, ?is true; but I have yet
a stronger objection against the misrepresentation of your
state.&nbsp; I have always considered it as treason against the
great republic of human nature to make any man?s virtues
the means of deceiving him, whether on great or little
occasions.&nbsp; All imposture weakens confidence and chills
benevolence.&nbsp; When the sage finds that you are not what you
seemed, he will feel the resentment natural to a man who,
conscious of great abilities, discovers that he has been tricked
by understandings meaner than his own, and perhaps the distrust
which he can never afterwards wholly lay aside may stop the voice
of counsel and close the hand of charity; and where will you find
the power of restoring his benefactions to mankind, or his peace
to himself??</p><br>
<p>To this no reply was attempted, and Imlac began to hope that
their curiosity would subside; but next day Pekuah told him she
had now found an honest pretence for a visit to the astronomer,
for she would solicit permission to continue under him the
studies in which she had been initiated by the Arab, and the
Princess might go with her, either as a fellow-student, or
because a woman could not decently come alone.&nbsp; ?I am
afraid,? said Imlac, ?that he will soon be weary of
your company.&nbsp; Men advanced far in knowledge do not love to
repeat the elements of their art, and I am not certain that even
of the elements, as he will deliver them, connected with
inferences and mingled with reflections, you are a very capable
auditress.?&nbsp; ?That,? said Pekuah,
?must be my care.&nbsp; I ask of you only to take me
thither.&nbsp; My knowledge is perhaps more than you imagine it,
and by concurring always with his opinions I shall make him think
it greater than it is.?</p><br>
<p>The astronomer, in pursuance of this resolution, was told that
a foreign lady, travelling in search of knowledge, had heard of
his reputation, and was desirous to become his scholar.&nbsp; The
uncommonness of the proposal raised at once his surprise and
curiosity, and when after a short deliberation he consented to
admit her, he could not stay without impatience till the next
day.</p><br>
<p>The ladies dressed themselves magnificently, and were attended
by Imlac to the astronomer, who was pleased to see himself
approached with respect by persons of so splendid an
appearance.&nbsp; In the exchange of the first civilities he was
timorous and bashful; but when the talk became regular, he
recollected his powers, and justified the character which Imlac
had given.&nbsp; Inquiring of Pekuah what could have turned her
inclination towards astronomy, he received from her a history of
her adventure at the Pyramid, and of the time passed in the
Arab?s island.&nbsp; She told her tale with ease and
elegance, and her conversation took possession of his
heart.&nbsp; The discourse was then turned to astronomy.&nbsp;
Pekuah displayed what she knew.&nbsp; He looked upon her as a
prodigy of genius, and entreated her not to desist from a study
which she had so happily begun.</p><br>
<p>They came again and again, and were every time more welcome
than before.&nbsp; The sage endeavoured to amuse them, that they
might prolong their visits, for he found his thoughts grow
brighter in their company; the clouds of solitude vanished by
degrees as he forced himself to entertain them, and he grieved
when he was left, at their departure, to his old employment of
regulating the seasons.</p><br>
<p>The Princess and her favourite had now watched his lips for
several months, and could not catch a single word from which they
could judge whether he continued or not in the opinion of his
preternatural commission.&nbsp; They often contrived to bring him
to an open declaration; but he easily eluded all their attacks,
and, on which side soever they pressed him, escaped from them to
some other topic.</p><br>
<p>As their familiarity increased, they invited him often to the
house of Imlac, where they distinguished him by extraordinary
respect.&nbsp; He began gradually to delight in sublunary
pleasures.&nbsp; He came early and departed late; laboured to
recommend himself by assiduity and compliance; excited their
curiosity after new arts, that they might still want his
assistance; and when they made any excursion of pleasure or
inquiry, entreated to attend them.</p><br>
<p>By long experience of his integrity and wisdom, the Prince and
his sister were convinced that he might be trusted without
danger; and lest he should draw any false hopes from the
civilities which he received, discovered to him their condition,
with the motives of their journey, and required his opinion on
the choice of life.</p><br>
<p>?Of the various conditions which the world spreads
before you which you shall prefer,? said the sage, ?I
am not able to instruct you.&nbsp; I can only tell that I have
chosen wrong.&nbsp; I have passed my time in study without
experience?in the attainment of sciences which can for the
most part be but remotely useful to mankind.&nbsp; I have
purchased knowledge at the expense of all the common comforts of
life; I have missed the endearing elegance of female friendship,
and the happy commerce of domestic tenderness.&nbsp; If I have
obtained any prerogatives above other students, they have been
accompanied with fear, disquiet, and scrupulosity; but even of
these prerogatives, whatever they were, I have, since my thoughts
have been diversified by more intercourse with the world, begun
to question the reality.&nbsp; When I have been for a few days
lost in pleasing dissipation, I am always tempted to think that
my inquiries have ended in error, and that I have suffered much,
and suffered it in vain.?</p><br>
<p>Imlac was delighted to find that the sage?s
understanding was breaking through its mists, and resolved to
detain him from the planets till he should forget his task of
ruling them, and reason should recover its original
influence.</p><br>
<p>From this time the astronomer was received into familiar
friendship, and partook of all their projects and pleasures; his
respect kept him attentive, and the activity of Rasselas did not
leave much time unengaged.&nbsp; Something was always to be done;
the day was spent in making observations, which furnished talk
for the evening, and the evening was closed with a scheme for the
morrow.</p><br>
<p>The sage confessed to Imlac that since he had mingled in the
gay tumults of life, and divided his hours by a succession of
amusements, he found the conviction of his authority over the
skies fade gradually from his mind, and began to trust less to an
opinion which he never could prove to others, and which he now
found subject to variation, from causes in which reason had no
part.&nbsp; ?If I am accidentally left alone for a few
hours,? said he, ?my inveterate persuasion rushes
upon my soul, and my thoughts are chained down by some
irresistible violence; but they are soon disentangled by the
Prince?s conversation, and instantaneously released at the
entrance of Pekuah.&nbsp; I am like a man habitually afraid of
spectres, who is set at ease by a lamp, and wonders at the dread
which harassed him in the dark; yet, if his lamp be extinguished,
feels again the terrors which he knows that when it is light he
shall feel no more.&nbsp; But I am sometimes afraid, lest I
indulge my quiet by criminal negligence, and voluntarily forget
the great charge with which I am entrusted.&nbsp; If I favour
myself in a known error, or am determined by my own ease in a
doubtful question of this importance, how dreadful is my
crime!?</p><br>
<p>?No disease of the imagination,? answered Imlac,
?is so difficult of cure as that which is complicated with
the dread of guilt; fancy and conscience then act interchangeably
upon us, and so often shift their places, that the illusions of
one are not distinguished from the dictates of the other.&nbsp;
If fancy presents images not moral or religious, the mind drives
them away when they give it pain; but when melancholy notions
take the form of duty, they lay hold on the faculties without
opposition, because we are afraid to exclude or banish
them.&nbsp; For this reason the superstitious are often
melancholy, and the melancholy almost always superstitious.</p><br>
<p>?But do not let the suggestions of timidity overpower
your better reason; the danger of neglect <span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>can be but
as the probability of the obligation, which, when you consider it
with freedom, you find very little, and that little growing every
day less.&nbsp; Open your heart to the influence of the light,
which from time to time breaks in upon you; when scruples
importune you, which you in your lucid moments know to be vain,
do not stand to parley, but fly to business or to Pekuah; and
keep this thought always prevalent, that you are only one atom of
the mass of humanity, and have neither such virtue nor vice as
that you should be singled out for supernatural favours or
afflictions.?</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII<br>
THE PRINCE ENTERS, AND BRINGS A NEW TOPIC.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">All</span> this,? said the
astronomer, ?I have often thought; but my reason has been
so long subjugated by an uncontrollable and overwhelming idea,
that it durst not confide in its own decisions.&nbsp; I now see
how fatally I betrayed my quiet, by suffering chimeras to prey
upon me in secret; but melancholy shrinks from communication, and
I never found a man before to whom I could impart my troubles,
though I had been certain of relief.&nbsp; I rejoice to find my
own sentiments confirmed by yours, who are not easily deceived,
and can have no motive or purpose to deceive.&nbsp; I hope that
time and variety will dissipate the gloom that has so long
surrounded me, and the latter part of my days will be spent in
peace.?</p><br>
<p>?Your learning and virtue,? said Imlac, ?may
justly give you hopes.?</p><br>
<p>Rasselas then entered, with the Princess and Pekuah, and
inquired whether they had contrived any new diversion for the
next day.&nbsp; ?Such,? said Nekayah, ?is the
state of life, that none are happy but by the anticipation of
change; the change itself is nothing; when we have made it the
next wish is to change again.&nbsp; The world is not yet
exhausted: let me see something to-morrow which I never saw
before.?</p><br>
<p>?Variety,? said Rasselas, ?is so necessary
to content, that even the Happy Valley disgusted me by the
recurrence of its luxuries; yet I could not forbear to reproach
myself with impatience when I saw the monks of St. Anthony
support, without complaint, a life, not of uniform delight, but
uniform hardship.?</p><br>
<p>?Those men,? answered Imlac, ?are less
wretched in their silent convent than the Abyssinian princes in
their prison of pleasure.&nbsp; Whatever is done by the monks is
incited by an adequate and reasonable motive.&nbsp; Their labour
supplies them with necessaries; it therefore cannot be omitted,
and is certainly rewarded.&nbsp; Their devotion prepares them for
another state, and reminds them of its approach while it fits
them for it.&nbsp; Their time is regularly distributed; one duty
succeeds another, so that they are not left open to the
distraction of unguided choice, nor lost in the shades of
listless inactivity.&nbsp; There is a certain task to be
performed at an appropriated hour, and their toils are cheerful,
because they consider them as acts of piety by which they are
always advancing towards endless felicity.?</p><br>
<p>?Do you think,? said Nekayah, ?that the
monastic rule is a more holy and less imperfect state than any
other?&nbsp; May not he equally hope for future happiness who
converses openly with mankind, who succours the distressed by his
charity, instructs the ignorant by his learning, and contributes
by his industry to the general system of life, even though he
should omit some of the mortifications which are practised in the
cloister, and allow himself such harmless delights as his
condition may place within his reach??</p><br>
<p>?This,? said Imlac, ?is a question which has
long divided the wise and perplexed the good.&nbsp; I am afraid
to decide on either part.&nbsp; He that lives well in the world
is better than he that lives well in a monastery.&nbsp; But
perhaps everyone is not able to stem the temptations of public
life, and if he cannot conquer he may properly retreat.&nbsp;
Some have little power to do good, and have likewise little
strength to resist evil.&nbsp; Many are weary of the conflicts
with adversity, and are willing to eject those passions which
have long busied them in vain.&nbsp; And many are dismissed by
age and diseases from the more laborious duties of society.&nbsp;
In monasteries the weak and timorous may be happily sheltered,
the weary may repose, and the penitent may meditate.&nbsp; Those
retreats of prayer and contemplation have something so congenial
to the mind of man, that perhaps there is scarcely one that does
not purpose to close his life in pious abstraction, with a few
associates serious as himself.?</p><br>
<p>?Such,? said Pekuah, ?has often been my
wish, and I have heard the Princess declare that she should not
willingly die in a crowd.?</p><br>
<p>?The liberty of using harmless pleasures,?
proceeded Imlac, ?will not be disputed, but it is still to
be examined what pleasures are harmless.&nbsp; The evil of any
pleasure that Nekayah can image is not in the act itself but in
its consequences.&nbsp; Pleasure in itself harmless may become
mischievous by endearing to us a state which we know to be
transient and probatory, and withdrawing our thoughts from that
of which every hour brings us nearer to the beginning, and of
which no length of time will bring us to the end.&nbsp;
Mortification is not virtuous in itself, nor has any other use
but that it disengages us from the allurements of sense.&nbsp; In
the state of future perfection to which we all aspire there will
be pleasure without danger and security without
restraint.?</p><br>
<p>The Princess was silent, and Rasselas, turning to the
astronomer, asked him whether he could not delay her retreat by
showing her something which she had not seen before.</p><br>
<p>?Your curiosity,? said the sage, ?has been
so general, and your pursuit of knowledge so vigorous, that
novelties are not now very easily to be found; but what you can
no longer procure from the living may be given by the dead.&nbsp;
Among the wonders of this country are the catacombs, or the
ancient repositories in which the bodies of the earliest
generations were lodged, and where, by the virtue of the gums
which embalmed them, they yet remain without
corruption.?</p><br>
<p><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>?I know not,? said Rasselas, ?what
pleasure the sight of the catacombs can afford; but, since
nothing else is offered, I am resolved to view them, and shall
place this with my other things which I have done because I would
do something.?</p><br>
<p>They hired a guard of horsemen, and the next day visited the
catacombs.&nbsp; When they were about to descend into the
sepulchral caves, ?Pekuah,? said the Princess,
?we are now again invading the habitations of the dead; I
know that you will stay behind.&nbsp; Let me find you safe when I
return.?&nbsp; ?No, I will not be left,?
answered Pekuah, ?I will go down between you and the
Prince.?</p><br>
<p>They then all descended, and roved with wonder through the
labyrinth of subterraneous passages, where the bodies were laid
in rows on either side.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII<br>
IMLAC DISCOURSES ON THE NATURE OF THE SOUL.</h2>
<p>?<span class="smcap">What</span> reason,? said the
Prince, ?can be given why the Egyptians should thus
expensively preserve those carcases which some nations consume
with fire, others lay to mingle with the earth, and all agree to
remove from their sight as soon as decent rites can be
performed??</p><br>
<p>?The original of ancient customs,? said Imlac,
?is commonly unknown, for the practice often continues when
the cause has ceased; and concerning superstitious ceremonies it
is vain to conjecture; for what reason did not dictate, reason
cannot explain.&nbsp; I have long believed that the practice of
embalming arose only from tenderness to the remains of relations
or friends; and to this opinion I am more inclined because it
seems impossible that this care should have been general; had all
the dead been embalmed, their repositories must in time have been
more spacious than the dwellings of the living.&nbsp; I suppose
only the rich or honourable were secured from corruption, and the
rest left to the course of nature.</p><br>
<p>?But it is commonly supposed that the Egyptians believed
the soul to live as long as the body continued undissolved, and
therefore tried this method of eluding death.?</p><br>
<p>?Could the wise Egyptians,? said Nekayah,
?think so grossly of the soul?&nbsp; If the soul could once
survive its separation, what could it afterwards receive or
suffer from the body??</p><br>
<p>?The Egyptians would doubtless think erroneously,?
said the astronomer, ?in the darkness of heathenism and the
first dawn of philosophy.&nbsp; The nature of the soul is still
disputed amidst all our opportunities of clearer knowledge; some
yet say that it may be material, who, nevertheless, believe it to
be immortal.?</p><br>
<p>?Some,? answered Imlac, ?have indeed said
that the soul is material, but I can scarcely believe that any
man has thought it who knew how to think; for all the conclusions
of reason enforce the immateriality of mind, and all the notices
of sense and investigations of science concur to prove the
unconsciousness of matter.</p><br>
<p>?It was never supposed that cogitation is inherent in
matter, or that every particle is a thinking being.&nbsp; Yet if
any part of matter be devoid of thought, what part can we suppose
to think?&nbsp; Matter can differ from matter only in form,
density, bulk, motion, and direction of motion.&nbsp; To which of
these, however varied or combined, can consciousness be
annexed?&nbsp; To be round or square, to be solid or fluid, to be
great or little, to be moved slowly or swiftly, one way or
another, are modes of material existence all equally alien from
the nature of cogitation.&nbsp; If matter be once without
thought, it can only be made to think by some new modification;
but all the modifications which it can admit are equally
unconnected with cogitative powers.?</p><br>
<p>?But the materialists,? said the astronomer,
?urge that matter may have qualities with which we are
unacquainted.?</p><br>
<p>?He who will determine,? returned Imlac,
?against that which he knows because there may be something
which he knows not; he that can set hypothetical possibility
against acknowledged certainty, is not to be admitted among
reasonable beings.&nbsp; All that we know of matter is, that
matter is inert, senseless, and lifeless; and if this conviction
cannot he opposed but by referring us to something that we know
not, we have all the evidence that human intellect can
admit.&nbsp; If that which is known may be overruled by that
which is unknown, no being, not omniscient, can arrive at
certainty.?</p><br>
<p>?Yet let us not,? said the astronomer, ?too
arrogantly limit the Creator?s power.?</p><br>
<p>?It is no limitation of Omnipotence,? replied the
poet, ?to suppose that one thing is not consistent with
another, that the same proposition cannot be at once true and
false, that the same number cannot be even and odd, that
cogitation cannot be conferred on that which is created incapable
of cogitation.?</p><br>
<p>?I know not,? said Nekayah, ?any great use
of this question.&nbsp; Does that immateriality, which in my
opinion you have sufficiently proved, necessarily include eternal
duration??</p><br>
<p>?Of immateriality,? said Imlac, ?our ideas
are negative, and therefore obscure.&nbsp; Immateriality seems to
imply a natural power of perpetual duration as a consequence of
exemption from all causes of decay: whatever perishes is
destroyed by the solution of its contexture and separation of its
parts; nor can we conceive how that which has no parts, and
therefore admits no solution, can be naturally corrupted or
impaired.?</p><br>
<p>?I know not,? said Rasselas, ?how to
conceive anything without extension: what is extended must have
parts, and you allow that whatever has parts may be
destroyed.?</p><br>
<p>?Consider your own conceptions,? replied Imlac,
?and the difficulty will be less.&nbsp; You will find
substance without extension.&nbsp; An ideal form is no less real
than material bulk; yet an ideal form has no extension.&nbsp; It
is no less certain, when you think on a pyramid, that your mind
possesses the idea of a pyramid, than that the pyramid itself is
standing.&nbsp; What space does the idea of a pyramid occupy more
than the idea of a grain of corn? or how can either idea suffer
laceration?&nbsp; As is the effect, such is the cause; as
thought, such is the power that thinks, a power impassive and
indiscerptible.?</p><br>
<p>?But the Being,? said Nekayah, ?whom I fear
to name, the Being which made the soul, can destroy
it.?</p><br>
<p>?He surely can destroy it,? answered Imlac,
?since, however imperishable, it receives from a superior
nature its power of duration.&nbsp; That it will not perish by
any inherent cause of decay or principle of corruption, may be
shown by philosophy; but philosophy can tell no more.&nbsp; That
it will not be annihilated by Him that made it, we must humbly
learn from higher authority.?</p><br>
<p>The whole assembly stood awhile silent and collected.&nbsp;
?Let us return,? said Rasselas, ?from this
scene of mortality.&nbsp; How gloomy would be these mansions of
the dead to him who did not know that he should never die; that
what now acts shall continue its agency, and what now thinks
shall think on for ever.&nbsp; Those that lie here stretched
before us, the wise and the powerful of ancient times, warn us to
remember the shortness of our present state; they were perhaps
snatched away while they were busy, like us, in the <i>choice of
life</i>.?</p><br>
<p>?To me,? said the Princess, ?the choice of
life is become less important; I hope hereafter to think only on
the choice of eternity.?</p><br>
<p>They then hastened out of the caverns, and under the
protection of their guard returned to Cairo.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX<br>
THE CONCLUSION, IN WHICH NOTHING IS CONCLUDED.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now the time of the
inundation of the Nile.&nbsp; A few days after their visit to the
catacombs the river began to rise.</p><br>
<p>They were confined to their house.&nbsp; The whole region
being under water, gave them no invitation to any excursions; and
being well supplied with materials for talk, they diverted
themselves with comparisons of the different forms of life which
they had observed, and with various schemes of happiness which
each of them had formed.</p><br>
<p>Pekuah was never so much charmed with any place as the Convent
of St. Anthony, where the Arab restored her to the Princess, and
wished only to fill it with pious maidens and to be made prioress
of the order.&nbsp; She was weary of expectation and disgust, and
would gladly be fixed in some unvariable state.</p><br>
<p>The Princess thought that, of all sublunary things, knowledge
was the best.&nbsp; She desired first to learn all sciences, and
then proposed to found a college of learned women, in which she
would preside, that, by conversing with the old and educating the
young, she might divide her time between the acquisition and
communication of wisdom, and raise up for the next age models of
prudence and patterns of piety.</p><br>
<p>The Prince desired a little kingdom in which he might
administer justice in his own person and see all the parts of
government with his own eyes; but he could never fix the limits
of his dominion, and was always adding to the number of his
subjects.</p><br>
<p>Imlac and the astronomer were contented to be driven along the
stream of life without directing their course to any particular
port.</p><br>
<p>Of those wishes that they had formed they well knew that none
could be obtained.&nbsp; They deliberated awhile what was to be
done, and resolved, when the inundation should cease, to return
to Abyssinia.</p><br>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in complianc
