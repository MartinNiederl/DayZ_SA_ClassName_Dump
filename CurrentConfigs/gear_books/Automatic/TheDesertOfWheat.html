 <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Late in June the vast northwestern
 desert of wheat began to take on a tinge of gold, lending
 an austere beauty to that endless, rolling, smooth world of
 treeless hills, where miles of fallow ground and miles of
 waving grain sloped up to the far-separated homes of the
 heroic men who had conquered over sage and sand.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">These simple homes of farmers seemed
 lost on an immensity of soft gray and golden billows of
 land, insignificant dots here and there on distant hills,
 so far apart that nature only seemed accountable for those
 broad squares of alternate gold and brown, extending on and
 on to the waving horizon-line. A lonely, hard, heroic
 country, where flowers and fruit were not, nor birds and
 brooks, nor green pastures. Whirling strings of dust looped
 up over fallow ground, the short, dry wheat lay back from
 the wind, the haze in the distance was drab and smoky,
 heavy with substance.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A thousand hills lay bare to the sky,
 and half of every hill was wheat and half was fallow
 ground; and all of them, with the shallow valleys between,
 seemed big and strange and isolated. The beauty of them was
 austere, as if the hand of man had been held back from
 making green his home site, as if the immensity of the task
 had left no time for youth and freshness. Years, long
 years, were there in the round-hilled, many-furrowed gray
 old earth. And the wheat looked a century old. Here and
 there a straight, dusty road stretched from hill to hill,
 becoming a thin white line, to disappear in the distance.
 The sun shone hot, the wind blew hard; and over the
 boundless undulating expanse hovered a shadow that was
 neither hood of dust nor hue of gold. It was not physical,
 but lonely, waiting, prophetic, and weird. No wild desert
 of wastelands, once the home of other races of man, and now
 gone to decay and death, could have shown so barren an
 acreage. Half of this wandering patchwork of squares was
 earth, brown and gray, curried and disked, and rolled and
 combed and harrowed, with not a tiny leaf of green in all
 the miles. The other half had only a faint golden promise
 of mellow harvest; and at long distance it seemed to
 shimmer and retreat under the hot sun. A singularly
 beautiful effect of harmony lay in the long, slowly rising
 slopes, in the rounded hills, in the endless curving lines
 on all sides. The scene was heroic because of the labor of
 horny hands; it was sublime because not a hundred harvests,
 nor three generations of toiling men, could ever rob nature
 of its limitless space and scorching sun and sweeping dust,
 of its resistless age-long creep back toward the desert
 that it had been.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Here was grown the most bounteous, the
 richest and finest wheat in all the world. Strange and
 unfathomable that so much of the bread of man, the staff of
 life, the hope of civilization in this tragic year 1917,
 should come from a vast, treeless, waterless, dreary
 desert!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This wonderful place was an immense
 valley of considerable altitude called the Columbia Basin,
 surrounded by the Cascade Mountains on the west, the Coeur
 d'Alene and Bitter Root Mountains on the east, the Okanozan
 range to the north, and the Blue Mountains to the south.
 The valley floor was basalt, from the lava flow of
 volcanoes in ages past. The rainfall was slight except in
 the foot-hills of the mountains. The Columbia River, making
 a prodigious and meandering curve, bordered on three sides
 what was known as the Bend country. South of this vast
 area, across the range, began the fertile, many-watered
 region that extended on down into verdant Oregon. Among the
 desert hills of this Bend country, near the center of the
 Basin, where the best wheat was raised, lay widely
 separated little towns, the names of which gave evidence of
 the mixed population. It was, of course, an exceedingly
 prosperous country, a fact manifest in the substantial
 little towns, if not in the crude and unpretentious homes
 of the farmers. The acreage of farms ran from a section,
 six hundred and forty acres, up into the thousands.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Upon a morning in early July, exactly
 three months after the United States had declared war upon
 Germany, a sturdy young farmer strode with darkly troubled
 face from the presence of his father. At the end of a
 stormy scene he had promised his father that he would
 abandon his desire to enlist in the army.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt Dorn walked away from the gray
 old clapboard house, out to the fence, where he leaned on
 the gate. He could see for miles in every direction, and to
 the southward, away on a long yellow slope, rose a stream
 of dust from a motor-car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Must be Anderson?coming to dun
 father," muttered young Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This was the day, he remembered, when
 the wealthy rancher of Ruxton was to look over old Chris
 Dorn's wheat-fields. Dorn owed thirty-thousand dollars and
 interest for years, mostly to Anderson. Kurt hated the debt
 and resented the visit, but he could not help acknowledging
 that the rancher had been lenient and kind. Long since Kurt
 had sorrowfully realized that his father was illiterate,
 hard, grasping, and growing worse with the burden of
 years.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"If we had rain now?or
 soon?that section of Bluestem would square father,"
 soliloquized young Dorn, as with keen eyes he surveyed a
 vast field of wheat, short, smooth, yellowing in the sun.
 But the cloudless sky, the haze of heat rather betokened a
 continued drought.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There were reasons, indeed, for Dorn
 to wear a dark and troubled face as he watched the
 motor-car speed along ahead of its stream of dust, pass out
 of sight under the hill, and soon reappear, to turn off the
 main road and come toward the house. It was a big, closed
 car, covered with dust. The driver stopped it at the gate
 and got out.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is this Chris Dorn's farm?" he
 asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes," replied Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Whereupon the door of the car opened
 and out stepped a short, broad man in a long linen
 coat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Come out, Lenore, an' shake off the
 dust," he said, and he assisted a young woman to step out.
 She also wore a long linen coat, and a veil besides. The
 man removed his coat and threw it into the car. Then he
 took off his sombrero to beat the dust off of that.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Phew! The Golden Valley never seen
 dust like this in a million years!? I'm chokin' for
 water. An' listen to the car. She's boilin'!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then, as he stepped toward Kurt, the
 rancher showed himself to be a well-preserved man of
 perhaps fifty-five, of powerful form beginning to sag in
 the broad shoulders, his face bronzed by long exposure to
 wind and sun. He had keen gray eyes, and their look was
 that of a man used to dealing with his kind and well
 disposed toward them.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hello! Are you young Dorn?" he
 asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, sir," replied Kurt, stepping
 out.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm Anderson, from Ruxton, come to
 see your dad. This is my girl Lenore."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt acknowledged the slight bow from
 the veiled young woman, and then, hesitating, he added,
 "Won't you come in?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, not yet. I'm chokin' for air an'
 water. Bring us a drink," replied Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt hurried away to get a bucket and
 tin cup. As he drew water from the well he was thinking
 rather vaguely that it was somehow embarrassing?the
 fact of Mr. Anderson being accompanied by his daughter.
 Kurt was afraid of his father. But then, what did it
 matter? When he returned to the yard he found the rancher
 sitting in the shade of one of the few apple-trees, and the
 young lady was standing near, in the act of removing bonnet
 and veil. She had thrown the linen coat over the seat of an
 old wagon-bed that lay near.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good water is scarce here, but I'm
 glad we have some," said Kurt; then as he set down the
 bucket and offered a brimming cupful to the girl he saw her
 face, and his eyes met hers. He dropped the cup and stared.
 Then hurriedly, with flushing face, he bent over to recover
 and refill it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Ex-excuse me. I'm?clumsy," he
 managed to say, and as he handed the cup to her he averted
 his gaze. For more than a year the memory of this very girl
 had haunted him. He had seen her twice?the first time
 at the close of his one year of college at the University
 of California, and the second time on the street in
 Spokane. In a glance he had recognized the strong, lithe
 figure, the sunny hair, the rare golden tint of her
 complexion, the blue eyes, warm and direct. And he had
 sustained a shock which momentarily confused him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good water, hey?" dissented Anderson,
 after drinking a second cup. "Boy that's wet, but it ain't
 water to drink. Come down in the foot-hills an' I'll show
 you. My ranch 's called 'Many Waters,' an' you can't keep
 your feet dry."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I wish we had some of it here,"
 replied Kurt, wistfully, and he waved a hand at the broad,
 swelling slopes. The warm breath that blew in from the
 wheatlands felt dry and smelled dry.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You're in for a dry spell?" inquired
 Anderson, with interest that was keen, and kindly as
 well.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father says so. And I fear it,
 too?for he never makes a mistake in weather or
 crops."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"A hot, dry spell!? This
 summer?? Hum!? Boy, do you know that wheat is
 the most important thing in the world to-day?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You mean on account of the war,"
 replied Kurt. "Yes, I know. But father doesn't see that.
 All he sees is?if we have rain we'll have bumper
 crops. That big field there would be a record?at war
 prices.? And he wouldn't be ruined!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Ruined?? Oh, he means I'd close
 on him.? Hum!? Say, what do you see in a big
 wheat yield?if it rains?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Anderson, I'd like to see our
 debt paid, but I'm thinking most of wheat for starving
 peoples. I?I've studied this wheat question. It's the
 biggest question in this war."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt had forgotten the girl and was
 unaware of her eyes bent steadily upon him. Anderson had
 roused to the interest of wheat, and to a deeper study of
 the young man.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, Dorn, how old are you?" he
 asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Twenty-four. And Kurt's my first
 name," was the reply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Will this farm fall to you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, if my father does not lose
 it."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hum!? Old Dorn won't lose it,
 never fear. He raises the best wheat in this section."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But father never owned the land. We
 have had three bad years. If the wheat fails this
 summer?we lose the land, that's all."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Are you an?American?" queried
 Anderson, slowly, as if treading on dangerous ground.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I am," snapped Kurt. "My mother was
 American. She's dead. Father is German. He's old. He's
 rabid since the President declared war. He'll never
 change."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's hell. What 're you goin' to do
 if your country calls you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Go!" replied Kurt, with flashing
 eyes. "I wanted to enlist. Father and I quarreled over that
 until I had to give in. He's hard?he's
 impossible.? I'll wait for the draft and hope I'm
 called."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, it's that spirit Germany's
 roused, an' the best I can say is, God help her!?
 Have you a brother?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. I'm all father has."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, it makes a tough place for him,
 an' you, too. Humor him. He's old. An' when you're
 called?go an' fight. You'll come back."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"If I only knew that?it wouldn't
 be so hard."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hard? It sure is hard. But it'll be
 the makin' of a great country. It'll weed out the
 riffraff.? See here, Kurt, I'm goin' to give you a
 hunch. Have you had any dealin's with the I.W.W.?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, last harvest we had trouble, but
 nothing serious. When I was in Spokane last month I heard a
 good deal. Strangers have approached us here,
 too?mostly aliens. I have no use for them, but they
 always get father's ear. And now!? To tell the truth,
 I'm worried."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, you need to be," replied
 Anderson, earnestly. "We're all worried. I'm goin' to let
 you read over the laws of that I.W.W. organization. You're
 to keep mum now, mind you. I belong to the Chamber of
 Commerce in Spokane. Somebody got hold of these by-laws of
 this so-called labor union. We've had copies made, an'
 every honest farmer in the Northwest is goin' to read them.
 But carryin' one around is dangerous, I reckon, these days.
 Here."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson hesitated a moment, peered
 cautiously around, and then, slipping folded sheets of
 paper from his inside coat pocket, he evidently made ready
 to hand them to Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lenore, where's the driver?" he
 asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He's under the car," replied the
 girl</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt thrilled at the soft sound of her
 voice. It was something to have been haunted by a girl's
 face for a year and then suddenly hear her voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He's new to me?that
 driver?an' I ain't trustin' any new men these days,"
 went on Anderson. "Here now, Dorn. Read that. An' if you
 don't get red-headed?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Without finishing his last muttered
 remark, he opened the sheets of manuscript and spread them
 out to the young man.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Curiously, and with a little rush of
 excitement, Kurt began to read. The very first rule of the
 I.W.W. aimed to abolish capital. Kurt read on with slowly
 growing amaze, consternation, and anger. When he had
 finished, his look, without speech, was a question Anderson
 hastened to answer.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's straight goods," he declared.
 "Them's the sure-enough rules of that gang. We made certain
 before we acted. Now how do they strike you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, that's no labor union!" replied
 Kurt, hotly. "They're outlaws, thieves, blackmailers,
 pirates. I?I don't know what!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dorn, we're up against a bad outfit
 an' the Northwest will see hell this summer. There's
 trouble in Montana and Idaho. Strangers are driftin' into
 Washington from all over. We must organize to meet
 them?to prevent them gettin' a hold out here. It's a
 labor union, mostly aliens, with dishonest an' unscrupulous
 leaders, some of them Americans. They aim to take advantage
 of the war situation. In the newspapers they rave about
 shorter hours, more pay, acknowledgment of the union. But
 any fool would see, if he read them laws I showed you, that
 this I.W.W. is not straight."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Anderson, what steps have you
 taken down in your country?" queried Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So far all I've done was to hire my
 hands for a year, give them high wages, an' caution them
 when strangers come round to feed them an' be civil an'
 send them on."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But we can't do that up here in the
 Bend," said Dorn, seriously. "We need, say, a hundred
 thousand men in harvest-time, and not ten thousand all the
 rest of the year."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure you can't. But you'll have to
 organize somethin'. Up here in this desert you could have a
 heap of trouble if that outfit got here strong enough.
 You'd better tell every farmer you can trust about this
 I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I've only one American neighbor, and
 he lives six miles from here," replied Dorn. "Olsen over
 there is a Swede, and not a naturalized citizen, but I
 believe he's for the U.S. And there's?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dad," interrupted the girl, "I
 believe our driver is listening to your very uninteresting
 conversation."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She spoke demurely, with laughter in
 her low voice. It made Dorn dare to look at her, and he met
 a blue blaze that was instantly averted.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson growled, evidently some very
 hard names, under his breath; his look just then was full
 of characteristic Western spirit. Then he got up.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lenore, I reckon your talk 'll be
 more interesting than mine," he said, dryly. "I'll go see
 Dorn an' get this business over."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'd rather go with you," hurriedly
 replied Kurt; and then, as though realizing a seeming
 discourtesy in his words, his face flamed, and he
 stammered: "I?I don't mean that. But father is in bad
 mood. We just quarreled.?I told you?about the
 war. And?Mr. Anderson,?I'm?I'm a little
 afraid he'll?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, son, I'm not afraid,"
 interrupted the rancher. "I'll beard the old lion in his
 den. You talk to Lenore."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Please don't speak of the war," said
 Kurt, appealingly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not a word unless he starts roarin'
 at Uncle Sam," declared Anderson, with a twinkle in his
 eyes, and turned toward the house.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He'll roar, all right," said Kurt,
 almost with a groan. He knew what an ordeal awaited the
 rancher, and he hated the fact that it could not be
 avoided. Then Kurt was confused, astounded, infuriated with
 himself over a situation he had not brought about and could
 scarcely realize. He became conscious of pride and shame,
 and something as black and hopeless as despair.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Haven't I seen you?before?"
 asked the girl.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The query surprised and thrilled Kurt
 out of his self-centered thought.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I don't know. Have you? Where?" he
 answered, facing her. It was a relief to find that she
 still averted her face.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"At Berkeley, in California, the first
 time, and the second at Spokane, in front of the
 Davenport," she replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"First?and?second??
 You?you remembered both times!" he burst out,
 incredulously.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes. I don't see how I could have
 helped remembering." Her laugh was low, musical, a little
 hurried, yet cool.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn was not familiar with girls. He
 had worked hard all his life, there among those desert
 hills, and during the few years his father had allowed him
 for education. He knew wheat, but nothing of the eternal
 feminine. So it was impossible for him to grasp that this
 girl was not wholly at her ease. Her words and the cool
 little laugh suddenly brought home to Kurt the immeasurable
 distance between him and a daughter of one of the richest
 ranchers in Washington.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You mean I?I was impertinent,"
 he began, struggling between shame and pride. "I?I
 stared at you.? Oh, I must have been rude.?
 But, Miss Anderson, I?I didn't mean to be. I didn't
 think you saw me?at all. I don't know what made me do
 that. It never happened before. I beg your pardon."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A subtle indefinable change,
 perceptible to Dorn, even in his confused state, came over
 the girl.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I did not say you were impertinent,"
 she returned. "I remembered seeing you?notice me,
 that is all."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Self-possessed, aloof, and kind, Miss
 Anderson now became an impenetrable mystery to Dorn. But
 that only accentuated the distance she had intimated lay
 between them. Her kindness stung him to recover his
 composure. He wished she had not been kind. What a singular
 chance that had brought her here to his home?the
 daughter of a man who came to demand a long-unpaid debt!
 What a dispelling of the vague thing that had been only a
 dream! Dorn gazed away across the yellowing hills to the
 dim blue of the mountains where rolled the Oregon. Despite
 the color, it was gray?like his future.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I heard you tell father you had
 studied wheat," said the girl, presently, evidently trying
 to make conversation.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, all my life," replied Kurt. "My
 study has mostly been under my father. Look at my hands."
 He held out big, strong hands, scarred and knotted, with
 horny palms uppermost, and he laughed. "I can be proud of
 them, Miss Anderson.? But I had a splendid year in
 California at the university and I graduated from the
 Washington State Agricultural College."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You love wheat?the raising of
 it, I mean?" she inquired.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It must be that I do, though I never
 had such a thought. Wheat is so wonderful. No one can guess
 who does not know it!? The clean, plump grain, the
 sowing on fallow ground, the long wait, the first tender
 green, and the change day by day to the deep waving fields
 of gold?then the harvest, hot, noisy, smoky, full of
 dust and chaff, and the great combine-harvesters with
 thirty-four horses. Oh! I guess I do love it all.? I
 worked in a Spokane flour-mill, too, just to learn how
 flour is made. There is nothing in the world so white, so
 clean, so pure as flour made from the wheat of these
 hills!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Next you'll be telling me that you
 can bake bread," she rejoined, and her laugh was low and
 sweet. Her eyes shone with soft blue gleams.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Indeed I can! I bake all the bread we
 use," he said, stoutly. "And I flatter myself I can beat
 any girl you know."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You can beat mine, I'm sure. Before I
 went to college I did pretty well. But I learned too much
 there. Now my mother and sisters, and brother Jim, all the
 family except dad, make fun of my bread."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You have a brother? How old is
 he?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"One brother?Jim, we call him.
 He?he is just past twenty-one." She faltered the last
 few words.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt felt on common ground with her
 then. The sudden break in her voice, the change in her
 face, the shadowing of the blue eyes?these were
 eloquent.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, it's horrible?this need of
 war!" she exclaimed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes," he replied, simply. "But maybe
 your brother will not be called."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Called! Why, he refused to wait for
 the draft! He went and enlisted. Dad patted him on the
 back.? If anything happens to him it'll kill my
 mother. Jim is her idol. It'd break my heart.? Oh, I
 hate the very name of Germans!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My father is German," said Kurt.
 "He's been fifty years in America?eighteen years here
 on this farm. He always hated England. Now he's bitter
 against America.? I can see a side you can't see. But
 I don't blame you?for what you said."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Forgive me. I can't conceive of
 meaning that against any one who's lived here so
 long.? Oh, it must be hard for you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll let my father think I'm forced
 to join the army. But I'm going to fight against his
 people. We are a house divided against itself."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, what a pity!" The girl sighed and
 her eyes were dark with brooding sorrow.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A step sounded behind them. Mr.
 Anderson appeared, sombrero off, mopping a very red face.
 His eyes gleamed, with angry glints; his mouth and chin
 were working. He flopped down with a great, explosive
 breath.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Kurt, your old man is
 a?a?son of a gun!" he exclaimed, vociferously;
 manifestly, liberation of speech was a relief.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The young man nodded seriously and
 knowingly. "I hope, sir?he?he?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He did?you just bet your life!
 He called me a lot in German, but I know cuss words when I
 hear them. I tried to reason with him?told him I
 wanted my money?was here to help him get that money
 off the farm, some way or other. An' he swore I was a
 capitalist?an enemy to labor an' the
 Northwest?that I an' my kind had caused the war."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt gazed gravely into the disturbed
 face of the rancher. Miss Anderson had wide-open eyes of
 wonder.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure I could have stood all that,"
 went on Anderson, fuming. "But he ordered me out of the
 house. I got mad an' wouldn't go. Then?by George! he
 pulled my nose an' called me a bloody Englishman!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt groaned in the disgrace of the
 moment. But, amazingly, Miss Anderson burst into a silvery
 peal of laughter.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, dad!? that's?just
 too?good for?anything! You met your?match
 at last.? You know you always?boasted of your
 drop of English blood.? And you're
 sensitive?about your big nose!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He must be over seventy," growled
 Anderson, as if seeking for some excuse to palliate his
 restraint. "I'm mad?but it was funny." The working of
 his face finally set in the huge wrinkles of a laugh.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Young Dorn struggled to repress his
 own mirth, but unguardedly he happened to meet the dancing
 blue eyes of the girl, merry, provocative, full of youth
 and fun, and that was too much for him. He laughed with
 them.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The joke's on me," said Anderson.
 "An' I can take one.? Now, young man, I think I
 gathered from your amiable dad that if the crop of wheat
 was full I'd get my money. Otherwise I could take over the
 land. For my part, I'd never do that, but the others
 interested might do it, even for the little money involved.
 I tried to buy them out so I'd have the whole mortgage.
 They would not sell."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Anderson, you're a square man,
 and I'll do?" declared Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Come out an' show me the wheat,"
 interrupted Anderson. "Lenore, do you want to go with
 us?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I do," replied the daughter, and she
 took up her hat to put it on.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt led them through the yard, out
 past the old barn, to the edge of the open slope where the
 wheat stretched away, down and up, as far as the eye could
 see.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We've got over sixteen hundred acres
 in fallow ground, a half-section in rye, another half in
 wheat?Turkey Red?and this section you see, six
 hundred and forty acres, in Bluestem," said Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson's keen eyes swept from near
 at hand to far away, down the gentle, billowy slope and up
 the far hillside. The wheat was two feet high, beginning to
 be thick and heavy at the heads, as if struggling to burst.
 A fragrant, dry, wheaty smell, mingled with dust, came on
 the soft summer breeze, and a faint silken rustle. The
 greenish, almost blue color near at hand gradually in the
 distance grew lighter, and then yellow, and finally took on
 a tinge of gold. There was a living spirit in that vast
 wheat-field.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dorn, it's the finest wheat I've
 seen!" exclaimed Anderson, with the admiration of the
 farmer who aspired high. "In fact, it's the only fine field
 of wheat I've seen since we left the foot-hills. How is
 that?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Late spring and dry weather," replied
 Dorn. "Most of the farmers' reports are poor. If we get
 rain over the Bend country we'll have only an average yield
 this year. If we don't get rain?then flat
 failure."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Miss Anderson evinced an interest in
 the subject and she wanted to know why this particular
 field, identical with all the others for miles around,
 should have a promise of a magnificent crop when the others
 had no promise at all.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"This section lay fallow a long time,"
 replied Dorn. "Snow lasted here on this north slope quite a
 while. My father used a method of soil cultivation intended
 to conserve moisture. The seed wheat was especially
 selected. And if we have rain during the next ten days this
 section of Bluestem will yield fifty bushels to the
 acre."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Fifty bushels!" ejaculated
 Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Bluestem? Why do you call it that
 when it's green and yellow?" queried the girl.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's a name. There are many varieties
 of wheat. Bluestem is best here in this desert country
 because it resists drought, it produces large yield, it
 does not break, and the flour-mills rate it very high.
 Bluestem is not good in wet soils."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson tramped along the edge of the
 field, peering down, here and there pulling a shaft of
 wheat and examining it. The girl gazed with dreamy eyes
 across the undulating sea. And Dorn watched her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We have a ranch?thousands of
 acres?but not like this," she said.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's the difference?" asked
 Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She appeared pensive and in doubt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I hardly know. What would you call
 this?this scene?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, I call it the desert of wheat!
 But no one else does," he replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I named father's ranch 'Many Waters.'
 I think those names tell the difference."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Isn't my desert beautiful?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. It has a sameness?a
 monotony that would drive me mad. It looks as if the whole
 world had gone to wheat. It makes me think?oppresses
 me. All this means that we live by wheat alone. These bare
 hills! They're too open to wind and sun and snow. They look
 like the toil of ages."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Miss Anderson, there is such a thing
 as love for the earth?the bare brown earth. You know
 we came from dust, and to dust we return! These fields are
 human to my father. And they have come to speak to
 me?a language I don't understand yet. But I
 mean?w hat you see?the growing wheat here, the
 field of clods over there, the wind and dust and glare and
 heat, the eternal sameness of the open space?these
 are the things around which my life has centered, and when
 I go away from them I am not content."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson came back to the young
 couple, carrying some heads of wheat in his hand.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Smut!" he exclaimed, showing both
 diseased and healthy specimens of wheat. "Had to hunt hard
 to find that. Smut is the bane of all wheat-growers. I
 never saw so little of it as there is here. In fact, we
 know scarcely nothin' about smut an' its cure, if there is
 any. You farmers who raise only grain have got the work
 down to a science. This Bluestem is not bearded wheat, like
 Turkey Red. Has that beard anythin' to do with smut?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I think not. The parasite, or fungus,
 lives inside the wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Never heard that before. No wonder
 smut is the worst trouble for wheat-raisers in the
 Northwest. I've fields literally full of smut. An' we never
 are rid of it. One farmer has one idea, an' some one else
 another. What could be of greater importance to a farmer?
 We're at war. The men who claim to know say that wheat will
 win the war. An' we lose millions of bushels from this
 smut. That's to say it's a terrible fact to face. I'd like
 to get your ideas."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn, happening to glance again at
 Miss Anderson, an act that seemed to be growing habitual,
 read curiosity and interest, and something more, in her
 direct blue eyes. The circumstance embarrassed him, though
 it tugged at the flood-gates of his knowledge. He could
 talk about wheat, and he did like to. Yet here was a girl
 who might be supposed to be bored. Still, she did not
 appear to be. That warm glance was not politeness.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, I'd like to hear every word you
 can say about wheat," she said, with an encouraging little
 nod.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure she would," added Anderson, with
 an affectionate hand on her shoulder. "She's a farmer's
 daughter. She'll be a farmer's wife."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He laughed at this last sally. The
 girl blushed. Dorn smiled and shook his head
 doubtfully.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I imagine that good fortune will
 never befall a farmer," he said.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, if it should," she replied,
 archly, "just consider how I might surprise him with my
 knowledge of wheat.? Indeed, Mr. Dorn, I am
 interested. I've never been in the Bend before?in
 your desert of wheat. I never before felt the greatness of
 loving the soil?or caring for it?of growing
 things from seed. Yet the Bible teaches that, and I read my
 Bible. Please tell us. The more you say the more I'll like
 it."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn was not proof against this
 eloquence. And he quoted two of his authorities, Heald and
 Woolman, of the State Agricultural Experiment Station,
 where he had studied for two years.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Bunt, or stinking smut, is caused by
 two different species of microscopic fungi which live as
 parasites in the wheat plant. Both are essentially similar
 in their effects and their life-history. <i>Tilletia
 tritici</i>, or the rough-spored variety, is the common
 stinking smut of the Pacific regions, while <i>Tilletia
 foetans</i>, or the smooth-spored species, is the one
 generally found in the eastern United States.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The smut 'berries,' or 'balls,' from
 an infected head contain millions of minute bodies, the
 spores or 'seeds' of the smut fungus. These reproduce the
 smut in somewhat the same way that a true seed develops
 into a new plant. A single smut ball of average size
 contains a sufficient number of spores to give one for each
 grain of wheat in five or six bushels. It takes eight smut
 spores to equal the diameter of a human hair. Normal wheat
 grains from an infected field may have so many spores
 lodged on their surface as to give them a dark color, but
 other grains which show no difference in color to the naked
 eye may still contain a sufficient number of spores to
 produce a smutty crop if seed treatment is not
 practised.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"When living smut spores are
 introduced into the soil with the seed wheat, or exist in
 the soil in which smut-free wheat is sown, a certain
 percentage of the wheat plants are likely to become
 infected. The smut spore germinates and produces first a
 stage of the smut plant in the soil. This first stage never
 infects a young seedling direct, but gives rise to
 secondary spores, or sporida, from which infection threads
 may arise and penetrate the shoot of a young seedling and
 reach the growing point. Here the fungus threads keep pace
 with the growth of the plant and reach maturity at or
 slightly before harvest-time.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Since this disease is caused by an
 internal parasite, it is natural to expect certain
 responses to its presence. It should be noted first that
 the smut fungus is living at the expense of its host plant,
 the wheat, and its effect on the host may be summarized as
 follows: The consumption of food, the destruction of food
 in the sporulating process, and the stimulating or
 retarding effect on normal physiological processes.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Badly smutted plants remain in many
 cases under-size and produce fewer and smaller heads. In
 the Fife and Bluestem varieties the infected heads previous
 to maturity exhibit a darker green color, and remain green
 longer than the normal heads. In some varieties the
 infected heads stand erect, when normal ones begin to droop
 as a result of the increasing weight of the ripening
 grain.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"A crop may become infected with smut
 in a number of different ways. Smut was originally
 introduced with the seed, and many farmers are still
 planting it every season with their seed wheat. Wheat taken
 from a smutty crop will have countless numbers of loose
 spores adhering to the grains, also a certain number of
 unbroken smut balls. These are always a source of danger,
 even when the seed is treated with fungicides before
 sowing.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"There are also chances for the
 infection of a crop if absolutely smut-free seed is
 employed. First, soil infection from a previous smutty
 crop; second, soil infection from wind-blown spores.
 Experiments have shown that separated spores from crushed
 smut balls lose their effective power in from two to three
 months, provided the soil is moist and loose, and in no
 case do they survive a winter.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It does not seem probable that wheat
 smut will be controlled by any single practice, but rather
 by the combined use of various methods: crop rotation; the
 use of clean seed; seed treatment with fungicides; cultural
 practices and breeding; and selection of varieties.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Failure to practise crop rotation is
 undoubtedly one of the main explanations for the general
 prevalence of smut in the wheat-fields of eastern
 Washington. Even with an intervening summer fallow, the
 smut from a previous crop may be a source of infection.
 Experience shows that a fall stubble crop is less liable to
 smut infection than a crop following summer fallow. The
 apparent explanation for this condition is the fact that
 the summer fallow becomes infected with wind-blown spores,
 while in a stubble crop the wind-blown spores, as well as
 those originating from the previous crop, are buried in
 plowing.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"If clean seed or properly treated
 seed had been used by all farmers we should never have had
 a smut problem. High per cents. of smut indicate either
 soil infection or imperfect treatment. The principle of the
 chemical treatment is to use a poison which will kill the
 superficial spores of the smut and not materially injure
 the germinating power of the seed. The hot-water treatment
 is only recommended when one of the chemical 'steeps' is
 not effective.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Certain cultural practices are
 beneficial in reducing the amount of smut in all cases,
 while the value of others depends to some extent upon the
 source of the smut spores. The factors which always
 influence the amount of smut are the temperature of the
 soil during the germinating period, the amount of soil
 moisture, and the depth of seeding. Where seed-borne spores
 are the only sources of infection, attention to the three
 factors mentioned will give the only cultural practices for
 reducing the amount of smut.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Early seeding has been practised by
 various farmers, and they report a marked reduction in
 smut.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The replowing of the summer fallow
 after the first fall rains is generally effective in
 reducing the amount of smut.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Very late planting?that is,
 four or five weeks after the first good fall rains?is
 also an effective practice. Fall tillage of summer fallow,
 other than plowing, seems to be beneficial.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No smut-immune varieties of wheat are
 known, but the standard varieties show varying degrees of
 resistance. Spring wheats generally suffer less from smut
 than winter varieties. This is not due to any superior
 resistance, but rather to the fact that they escape
 infection. If only spring wheats were grown our smut
 problem would largely disappear; but a return to this
 practice is not suggested, since the winter wheats are much
 more desirable. It seems probable that the conditions which
 prevail during the growing season may have considerable
 influence on the per cent of smut in any given
 variety."</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When Dorn finished his discourse, to
 receive the thanks of his listeners, they walked back
 through the yard toward the road. Mr. Anderson, who led the
 way, halted rather abruptly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hum! Who're those men talkin' to my
 driver?" he queried.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn then saw a couple of strangers
 standing near the motor-car, engaged in apparently close
 conversation with the chauffeur. Upon the moment they
 glanced up to see Mr. Anderson approaching, and they rather
 hurriedly departed. Dorn had noted a good many strangers
 lately?men whose garb was not that of farmers, whose
 faces seemed foreign, whose actions were suspicious.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll bet a hundred they're I.W.W.'s,"
 declared Anderson. "Take my hunch, Dorn."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The strangers passed on down the road
 without looking back.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wonder where they'll sleep to-night?"
 muttered Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson rather sharply asked his
 driver what the two men wanted. And the reply he got was
 that they were inquiring about work.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Did they speak English?" went on the
 rancher.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well enough to make themselves
 understood," replied the driver.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn did not get a good impression
 from the shifty eyes and air of taciturnity of Mr.
 Anderson's man, and it was evident that the blunt rancher
 restrained himself. He helped his daughter into the car,
 and then put on his long coat. Next he shook hands with
 Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Young man, I've enjoyed meetin' you,
 an' have sure profited from same," he said. "Which makes up
 for your dad! I'll run over here again to see
 you?around harvest-time. An' I'll be wishin' for that
 rain."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Thank you. If it does rain I'll be
 happy to see you," replied Dorn, with a smile.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, if it doesn't rain I won't
 come. I'll put it off another year, an' cuss them other
 fellers into holdin' off, too."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You're very kind. I don't know how
 I'd?we'd ever repay you in that case."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Don't mention it. Say, how far did
 you say it was to Palmer? We'll have lunch there."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's fifteen miles?that way,"
 answered Dorn. "If it wasn't for?for father I'd like
 you to stay?and break some of my bread."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn was looking at the girl as he
 spoke. Her steady gaze had been on him ever since she
 entered the car, and in the shade of her hat and the veil
 she was adjusting her eyes seemed very dark and sweet and
 thoughtful. She brightly nodded her thanks as she held the
 veil aside with both hands.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I wish you luck. Good-by," she said,
 and closed the veil.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Still, Dorn could see her eyes through
 it, and now they were sweeter, more mysterious, more
 provocative of haunting thoughts. It flashed over him with
 dread certainty that he had fallen in love with her. The
 shock struck him mute. He had no reply for the rancher's
 hearty farewell. Then the car lurched away and dust rose in
 a cloud.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With a strange knocking of his heart,
 high up toward his throat, Kurt Dorn stood stock-still,
 watching the moving cloud of dust until it disappeared over
 the hill.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">No doubt entered his mind. The truth,
 the fact, was a year old?a long-familiar and dreamy
 state?but its meaning had not been revealed to him
 until just a moment past. Everything had changed when she
 looked out with that sweet, steady gaze through the parted
 veil and then slowly closed it. She had changed. There was
 something intangible about her that last moment, baffling,
 haunting. He leaned against a crooked old gate-post that as
 a boy he had climbed, and the thought came to him that this
 spot would all his life be vivid and poignant in his
 memory. The first sight of a blue-eyed, sunny-haired girl,
 a year and more before, had struck deep into his
 unconscious heart; a second sight had made her an
 unforgettable reality: and a third had been the realization
 of love.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was sad, regrettable,
 incomprehensible, and yet somehow his inner being swelled
 and throbbed. Her name was Lenore Anderson. Her father was
 one of the richest men in the state of Washington. She had
 one brother, Jim, who would not wait for the army draft.
 Kurt trembled and a hot rush of tears dimmed his eyes. All
 at once his lot seemed unbearable. An immeasurable barrier
 had arisen between him and his old father?a hideous
 thing of blood, of years, of ineradicable difference; the
 broad acres of wheatland so dear to him were to be taken
 from him; love had overcome him with headlong rush, a love
 that could never be returned; and cruelest of all, there
 was the war calling him to give up his home, his father,
 his future, and to go out to kill and to be killed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It came to him while he leaned there,
 that, remembering the light of Lenore Anderson's eyes, he
 could not give up to bitterness and hatred, whatever his
 misfortunes and his fate. She would never be anything to
 him, but he and her brother Jim and many other young
 Americans must be incalculable all to her. That thought
 saved Kurt Dorn. There were other things besides his own
 career, his happiness; and the way he was placed, however
 unfortunate from a selfish point of view, must not breed a
 morbid self-pity.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The moment of his resolution brought a
 flash, a revelation of what he owed himself. The work and
 the thought and the feeling of his last few weeks there at
 home must be intensified. He must do much and live greatly
 in little time. This was the moment of his renunciation,
 and he imagined that many a young man who had decided to go
 to war had experienced a strange spiritual division of
 self. He wondered also if that moment was not for many of
 them a let-down, a throwing up of ideals, a helpless
 retrograding and surrender to the brutalizing spirit of
 war. But it could never be so for him. It might have been
 had not that girl come into his life.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The bell for the midday meal roused
 Kurt from his profound reverie, and he plodded back to the
 house. Down through the barnyard gate he saw the hired men
 coming, and a second glance discovered to him that two
 unknown men were with them. Watching for a moment, Kurt
 recognized the two strangers that had been talking to Mr.
 Anderson's driver. They seemed to be talking earnestly now.
 Kurt saw Jerry, a trusty and long-tried employee, rather
 unceremoniously break away from these strangers. But they
 followed him, headed him off, and with vehement nods and
 gesticulations appeared to be arguing with him. The other
 hired men pushed closer, evidently listening. Finally Jerry
 impatiently broke away and tramped toward the house. These
 strangers sent sharp words after him?words that Kurt
 could not distinguish, though he caught the tone of scorn.
 Then the two individuals addressed themselves to the other
 men; and in close contact the whole party passed out of
 sight behind the barn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Thoughtfully Kurt went into the house.
 He meant to speak to Jerry about the strangers, but he
 wanted to consider the matter first. He had misgivings. His
 father was not in the sitting-room, nor in the kitchen.
 Dinner was ready on the table, and the one servant, an old
 woman who had served the Dorns for years, appeared
 impatient at the lack of promptness in the men. Both father
 and son, except on Sundays, always ate with the hired help.
 Kurt stepped outside to find Jerry washing at the
 bench.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jerry, what's keeping the men?"
 queried Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, they're palaverin' out there
 with two I.W.W. fellers," replied Jerry.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt reached for the rope of the
 farm-bell, and rang it rather sharply. Then he went in to
 take his place at the table, and Jerry soon followed. Old
 man Dorn did not appear, which fact was not unusual. The
 other hired men did not enter until Jerry and Kurt were
 half done with the meal. They seemed excited and somewhat
 boisterous, Kurt thought, but once they settled down to
 eating, after the manner of hungry laborers, they had
 little to say. Kurt, soon finishing his dinner, went
 outdoors to wait for Jerry. That individual appeared to be
 long in coming, and loud voices in the kitchen attested to
 further argument. At last, however, he lounged out and
 began to fill a pipe.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jerry, I want to talk to you," said
 Kurt. "Let's get away from the house."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The hired man was a big, lumbering
 fellow, gnarled like an old oak-tree. He had a good-natured
 face and honest eyes.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon you want to hear about them
 I.W.W. fellers?" he asked, as they walked away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes," replied Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"There's been a regular procession of
 them fellers, the last week or so, walkin' through the
 country," replied Jerry. "To-day's the first time any of
 them got to me. But I've heerd talk. Sunday when I was in
 Palmer the air was full of rumors."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Rumors of what?" queried Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All kinds," answered Jerry,
 nonchalantly scratching his stubby beard. "There's an army
 of I.W.W.'s comin' in from eastward. Idaho an' Montana are
 gittin' a dose now. Short hours; double wages; join the
 union; sabotage, whatever thet is; capital an' labor fight;
 threats if you don't fall in line; an' Lord knows what
 all."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What did those two fellows want of
 you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wanted us to join the I.W.W.,"
 replied the laborer.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Did they want a job?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not as I heerd. Why, one of them had
 a wad of bills thet would choke a cow. He did most of the
 talkin'. The little feller with the beady eyes an' the
 pock-marks, he didn't say much. He's Austrian an' not long
 in this country. The big stiff?Glidden, he called
 himself?must be some shucks in thet I.W.W. He looked
 an' talked oily at first?very persuadin'; but when I
 says I wasn't goin' to join no union he got sassy an'
 bossy. They made me sore, so I told him to go to hell. Then
 he said the I.W.W. would run the whole Northwest this
 summer?wheat-fields, lumberin', fruit-harvestin',
 railroadin'?the whole kaboodle, an' thet any workman
 who wouldn't join would git his, all right."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, Jerry, what do you think about
 this organization?" queried Kurt, anxiously.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not much. It ain't a square deal. I
 ain't got no belief in them. What I heerd of their
 threatenin' methods is like the way this Glidden talks. If
 I owned a farm I'd drive such fellers off with a whip.
 There's goin' to be bad doin's if they come driftin' strong
 into the Bend."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jerry, are you satisfied with your
 job?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure. I won't join the I.W.W. An'
 I'll talk ag'in' it. I reckon a few of us will hev to do
 all the harvestin'. An', considerin' thet, I'll take a
 dollar a day more on my wages."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"If father does not agree to that, I
 will," said Kurt. "Now how about the other men?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, they all air leanin' toward
 promises of little work an' lots of pay," answered Jerry,
 with a laugh. "Morgan's on the fence about joinin'. But
 Andrew agreed. He's Dutch an' pig-headed. Jansen's only too
 glad to make trouble fer his boss. They're goin' to lay off
 the rest of to-day an' talk with Glidden. They all agreed
 to meet down by the culvert. An' thet's what they was
 arguin' with me fer?wanted me to come."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Where's this man Glidden?" demanded
 Kurt. "I'll give him a piece of my mind."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon he's hangin' round the
 farm?out of sight somewhere."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All right, Jerry. Now you go back to
 work. You'll never lose anything by sticking to us, I
 promise you that. Keep your eyes and ears open."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt strode back to the house, and his
 entrance to the kitchen evidently interrupted a colloquy of
 some kind. The hired men were still at table. They looked
 down at their plates and said nothing. Kurt left the
 sitting-room door open, and, turning, he asked Martha if
 his father had been to dinner.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, an' what's more, when I called he
 takes to roarin' like a mad bull," replied the woman.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt crossed the sitting-room to knock
 upon his father's door. The reply forthcoming did justify
 the old woman's comparison. It certainly caused the hired
 men to evacuate the kitchen with alacrity. Old Chris Dorn's
 roar at his son was a German roar, which did not soothe the
 young man's rising temper. Of late the father had taken
 altogether to speaking German. He had never spoken English
 well. And Kurt was rapidly approaching the point where he
 would not speak German. A deadlock was in sight, and Kurt
 grimly prepared to meet it. He pounded on the locked
 door.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The men are going to lay off," he
 called.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Who runs this farm?" was the
 thundered reply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The I.W.W. is going to run it if you
 sulk indoors as you have done lately," yelled Kurt. He
 thought that would fetch his father stamping out, but he
 had reckoned falsely. There was no further sound. Leaving
 the room in high dudgeon, Kurt hurried out to catch the
 hired men near at hand and to order them back to work. They
 trudged off surlily toward the barn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then Kurt went on to search for the
 I.W.W. men, and after looking up and down the road, and all
 around, he at length found them behind an old strawstack.
 They were comfortably sitting down, backs to the straw,
 eating a substantial lunch. Kurt was angry and did not
 care. His appearance, however, did not faze the strangers.
 One of them, an American, was a man of about thirty years,
 clean-shaven, square-jawed, with light, steely, secretive
 gray eyes, and a look of intelligence and assurance that
 did not harmonize with his motley garb. His companion was a
 foreigner, small of stature, with eyes like a ferret and
 deep pits in his sallow face.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Do you know you're trespassing?"
 demanded Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You grudge us a little shade, eh,
 even to eat a bite?" said the American. He wrapped a paper
 round his lunch and leisurely rose, to fasten penetrating
 eyes upon the young man. "That's what I heard about you
 rich farmers of the Bend."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What business have you coming here?"
 queried Kurt, with sharp heat. "You sneak out of sight of
 the farmers. You trespass to get at our men and with a lot
 of lies and guff you make them discontented with their
 jobs. I'll fire these men just for listening to you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mister Dorn, we want you to fire
 them. That's my business out here," replied the
 American.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Who are you, anyway?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's my business, too."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt passed from hot to cold. He could
 not miss the antagonism of this man, a bold and menacing
 attitude.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My foreman says your name's Glidden,"
 went on Kurt, cooler this time, "and that you're talking
 I.W.W. as if you were one of its leaders; that you don't
 want a job; that you've got a wad of money; that you coax,
 then threaten; that you've intimidated three of our
 hands."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Your Jerry's a marked man," said
 Glidden, shortly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You impudent scoundrel!" exclaimed
 Kurt. "Now you listen to this. You're the first I.W.W. man
 I've met. You look and talk like an American. But if you
 are American you're a traitor. We've a war to fight! War
 with a powerful country! Germany! And you come spreading
 discontent in the wheat-fields,? when wheat means
 life!? Get out of here before I?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We'll mark you, too, Mister Dorn, and
 your wheat-fields," snapped Glidden.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With one swift lunge Kurt knocked the
 man flat and then leaped to stand over him, watching for a
 move to draw a weapon. The little foreigner slunk back out
 of reach.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll start a little marking myself,"
 grimly said Kurt. "Get up!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Slowly Glidden moved from elbow to
 knees, and then to his feet. His cheek was puffing out and
 his nose was bleeding. The light-gray eyes were lurid.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's for your I.W.W.!" declared
 Kurt. "The first rule of your I.W.W. is to abolish capital,
 hey?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt had not intended to say that. It
 slipped out in his fury. But the effect was striking.
 Glidden gave a violent start and his face turned white.
 Abruptly he hurried away. His companion shuffled after him.
 Kurt stared at them, thinking the while that if he had
 needed any proof of the crookedness of the I.W.W. he had
 seen it in Glidden's guilty face. The man had been suddenly
 frightened, and surprise, too, had been prominent in his
 countenance. Then Kurt remembered how Anderson had
 intimated that the secrets of the I.W.W. had been long
 hidden. Kurt, keen and quick in his sensibilities, divined
 that there was something powerful back of this Glidden's
 cunning and assurance. Could it be only the power of a new
 labor organization? That might well be great, but the idea
 did not convince Kurt. During a hurried and tremendous
 preparation by the government for war, any disorder such as
 menaced the country would be little short of a calamity. It
 might turn out a fatality. This so-called labor union
 intended to take advantage of a crisis to further its own
 ends. Yet even so, that fact did not wholly explain Glidden
 and his subtlety. Some nameless force loomed dark and
 sinister back of Glidden's meaning, and it was not peril to
 the wheatlands of the Northwest alone.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Like a huge dog Kurt shook himself and
 launched into action. There were sense and pleasure in
 muscular activity, and it lessened the habit of worry. Soon
 he ascertained that only Morgan had returned to work in the
 fields. Andrew and Jansen were nowhere to be seen. Jansen
 had left four horses hitched to a harrow. Kurt went out to
 take up the work thus abandoned.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was a long field, and if he had
 earned a dollar for every time he had traversed its length,
 during the last ten years, he would have been a rich man.
 He could have walked it blindfolded. It was fallow ground,
 already plowed, disked, rolled, and now the last stage was
 to harrow it, loosening the soil, conserving the
 moisture.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Morgan, far to the other side of this
 section, had the better of the job, for his harrow was a
 new machine and he could ride while driving the horses. But
 Kurt, using an old harrow, had to walk. The four big horses
 plodded at a gait that made Kurt step out to keep up with
 them. To keep up, to drive a straight line, to hold back on
 the reins, was labor for a man. It spoke well for Kurt that
 he had followed that old harrow hundreds of miles, that he
 could stand the strain, that he loved both the physical
 sense and the spiritual meaning of the toil.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Driving west, he faced a wind laden
 with dust as dry as powder. At every sheeted cloud,
 whipping back from the hoofs of the horses and the steel
 spikes of the harrow, he had to bat his eyes to keep from
 being blinded. The smell of dust clogged his nostrils. As
 soon as he began to sweat under the hot sun the dust caked
 on his face, itching, stinging, burning. There was dust
 between his teeth.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Driving back east was a relief. The
 wind whipped the dust away from him. And he could catch the
 fragrance of the newly turned soil. How brown and clean and
 earthy it looked! Where the harrow had cut and ridged, the
 soil did not look thirsty and parched. But that which was
 unharrowed cried out for rain. No cloud in the hot sky,
 except the yellow clouds of dust!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">On that trip east across the field,
 which faced the road, Dorn saw pedestrians in twos and
 threes passing by. Once he was hailed, but made no answer.
 He would not have been surprised to see a crowd, yet
 travelers were scarce in that region. The sight of these
 men, some of them carrying bags and satchels, was
 disturbing to the young farmer. Where were they going? All
 appeared outward bound toward the river. They came, of
 course, from the little towns, the railroads, the cities.
 At this season, with harvest-time near at hand, it had been
 in former years no unusual sight to see strings of laborers
 passing by. But this year they came earlier, and in greater
 numbers.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With the wind in his face, however,
 Dorn saw nothing but the horses and the brown line ahead,
 and half the time they were wholly obscured in yellow dust.
 He began thinking about Lenore Anderson, just pondering
 that strange, steady look of a girl's eyes; and then he did
 not mind the dust or heat or distance. Never could he be
 cheated of his thoughts. And those of her, even the painful
 ones, gave birth to a comfort that he knew must abide with
 him henceforth on lonely labors such as this, perhaps in
 the lonelier watches of a soldier's duty. She had been
 curious, aloof, then sympathetic; she had studied his face;
 she had been an eloquent-eyed listener to his discourse on
 wheat. But she had not guessed his secret. Not until her
 last look?strange, deep, potent?had he guessed
 that secret himself.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">So, with mind both busy and absent,
 Kurt Dorn harrowed the fallow ground abandoned by his men;
 and when the day was done, with the sun setting hot and
 coppery beyond the dim, dark ranges, he guided the tired
 horses homeward and plodded back of them, weary and
 spent.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He was to learn from Morgan, at the
 stables, that the old man had discharged both Andrew and
 Jansen. And Jansen, liberating some newly assimilated
 poison, had threatened revenge. He would see that any hired
 men would learn a thing or two, so that they would not sign
 up with Chris Dorn. In a fury the old man had driven Jansen
 out into the road.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Sober and moody, Kurt put the horses
 away, and, washing the dust grime from sunburnt face and
 hands, he went to his little attic room, where he changed
 his damp and sweaty clothes. Then he went down to supper
 with mind made up to be lenient and silent with his old and
 sorely tried father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Chris Dorn sat in the light of the
 kitchen lamps. He was a huge man with a great, round,
 bullet-shaped head and a shock of gray hair and bristling,
 grizzled beard. His face was broad, heavy, and seemed
 sodden with dark, brooding thought. His eyes, under bushy
 brows, were pale gleams of fire. He looked immovable as to
 both bulk and will.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Never before had Kurt Dorn so acutely
 felt the fixed, contrary, ruthless nature of his parent.
 Never had the distance between them seemed so great. Kurt
 shivered and sighed at once. Then, being hungry, he fell to
 eating in silence. Presently the old man shoved his plate
 back, and, wiping his face, he growled, in German:</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I discharged Andrew and Jansen."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, I know," replied Kurt. "It
 wasn't good judgment. What'll we do for hands?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll hire more. Men are coming for
 the harvest."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But they all belong to the I.W.W.,"
 protested Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"And what's that?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">In scarcely subdued wrath Kurt
 described in detail, and to the best of his knowledge, what
 the I.W.W. was, and he ended by declaring the organization
 treacherous to the United States.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"How's that?" asked old Dorn,
 gruffly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt was actually afraid to tell his
 father, who never read newspapers, who knew little of what
 was going on, that if the Allies were to win the war it was
 wheat that would be the greatest factor. Instead of that he
 said if the I.W.W. inaugurated strikes and disorder in the
 Northwest it would embarrass the government.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Then I'll hire I.W.W. men," said old
 Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt battled against a rising temper.
 This blind old man was his father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But I'll not have I.W.W. men on the
 farm," retorted Kurt. "I just punched one I.W.W.
 solicitor."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll run this farm. If you don't like
 my way you can leave," darkly asserted the father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt fell back in his chair and stared
 at the turgid, bulging forehead and hard eyes before him.
 What could be behind them? Had the war brought out a twist
 in his father's brain? Why were Germans so impossible?</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My Heavens! father, would you turn me
 out of my home because we disagree?" he asked,
 desperately.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"In my country sons obey their fathers
 or they go out for themselves."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I've not been a disobedient son,"
 declared Kurt. "And here in America sons have more
 freedom?more say."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"America has no sense of family
 life?no honest government. I hate the country."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A ball of fire seemed to burst in
 Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That kind of talk infuriates me," he
 blazed. "I don't care if you are my father. Why in the hell
 did you come to America? Why did you stay? Why did you
 marry my mother?an American woman?? That's
 rot?just spiteful rot! I've heard you tell what life
 was in Europe when you were a boy. You ran off. You stayed
 in this country because it was a better country than
 yours.? Fifty years you've been in America?many
 years on this farm. And you love this land.? My God!
 father, can't you and men like you see the truth?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Aye, I can," gloomily replied the old
 man. "The truth is we'll lose the land. That greedy
 Anderson will drive me off."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He will not. He's
 fine?generous," asserted Kurt, earnestly. "All he
 wanted was to see the prospects of the harvest and perhaps
 to help you. Anderson has not had interest on his money for
 three years. I'll bet he's paid interest demanded by the
 other stockholders in that bank you borrowed from. Why,
 he's our friend!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Aye, and I see more," boomed the
 father. "He fetched his lass up here to make eyes at my
 son. I saw her?the sly wench!? Boy, you'll not
 marry her!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt choked back his mounting
 rage.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Certainly I never will," he said,
 bitterly. "But I would if she'd have me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What!" thundered Dorn, his white
 locks standing up and shaking like the mane of a lion.
 "That wheat banker's daughter! Never! I forbid it. You
 shall not marry any American girl."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father, this is idle, foolish rant,"
 cried Kurt, with a high warning note in his voice. "I've no
 idea of marrying.? But if I had one?whom else
 could I marry except an American girl?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll sell the wheat?the land.
 We'll go back to Germany!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That was maddening to Kurt. He sprang
 up, sending dishes to the floor with a crash. He bent over
 to pound the table with a fist. Violent speech choked him
 and he felt a cold, tight blanching of his face.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Listen!" he rang out. "If I go to
 Germany it'll be as a soldier?to kill Germans!?
 I'm done?I'm through with the very name.?
 Listen to the last words I'll ever speak to you in
 German?the last! <i>To hell with Germany</i>!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then Kurt plunged, blind in his
 passion, out of the door into the night. And as he went he
 heard his father cry out, brokenly:</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My son! Oh, my son!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The night was dark and cool. A faint
 wind blew across the hills, and it was dry, redolent,
 sweet. The sky seemed an endless curving canopy of dark
 blue blazing with myriads of stars.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt staggered out of the yard, down
 along the edge of a wheat-field, to one of the
 straw-stacks, and there he flung himself down in an
 agony.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, I'm ruined?ruined!" he
 moaned. "The break?has come!? Poor old
 dad!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He leaned there against the straw,
 shaking and throbbing, with a cold perspiration bathing
 face and body. Even the palms of his hands were wet. A
 terrible fit of anger was beginning to loose its hold upon
 him. His breathing was labored in gasps and sobs.
 Unutterable stupidity of his father?horrible cruelty
 of his position! What had he ever done in all his life to
 suffer under such a curse? Yet almost he clung to his
 wrath, for it had been righteous. That thing, that infernal
 twist in the brain, that was what was wrong with his
 father. His father who had been fifty years in the United
 States! How simple, then, to understand what was wrong with
 Germany.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"By God! I am?American!" he
 panted, and it was as if he called to the grave of his
 mother, over there on the dark, windy hill.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That tremendous uprising of his
 passion had been a vortex, an end, a decision. And he
 realized that even to that hour there had been a drag in
 his blood. It was over now. The hell was done with. His
 soul was free. This weak, quaking body of his housed his
 tainted blood and the emotions of his heart, but it could
 not control his mind, his will. Beat by beat the helpless
 fury in him subsided, and then he fell back and lay still
 for a long time, eyes shut, relaxed and still.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A hound bayed mournfully; the insects
 chirped low, incessantly; the night wind rustled the silken
 heads of wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">After a while the young man sat up and
 looked at the heavens, at the twinkling white stars, and
 then away across the shadows of round hills in the dusk.
 How lonely, sad, intelligible, and yet mystic the night and
 the scene!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">What came to him then was revealing,
 uplifting?a source of strength to go on. He was not
 to blame for what had happened; he could not change the
 future. He had a choice between playing the part of a man
 or that of a coward, and he had to choose the former. There
 seemed to be a spirit beside him?the spirit of his
 mother or of some one who loved him and who would have him
 be true to an ideal, and, if needful, die for it. No night
 in all his life before had been like this one. The dreaming
 hills with their precious rustling wheat meant more than
 even a spirit could tell. Where had the wheat come from
 that had seeded these fields? Whence the first and original
 seeds, and where were the sowers? Back in the ages! The
 stars, the night, the dark blue of heaven hid the secret in
 their impenetrableness. Beyond them surely was the answer,
 and perhaps peace.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Material things?life,
 success?such as had inspired Kurt Dorn, on this calm
 night lost their significance and were seen clearly. They
 could not last. But the wheat there, the hills, the
 stars?they would go on with their task. Passion was
 the dominant side of a man declaring itself, and that was a
 matter of inheritance. But self-sacrifice, with its mercy,
 its succor, its seed like the wheat, was as infinite as the
 stars. He had long made up his mind, yet that had not given
 him absolute restraint. The world was full of little men,
 but he refused to stay little. This war that had come
 between him and his father had been bred of the fumes of
 self-centered minds, turned with an infantile fatality to
 greedy desires. His poor old blinded father could be
 excused and forgiven. There were other old men, sick,
 crippled, idle, who must suffer pain, but whose pain could
 be lightened. There were babies, children, women, who must
 suffer for the sins of men, but that suffering need no
 longer be, if men became honest and true.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">His sudden up-flashing love had a few
 hours back seemed a calamity. But out there beside the
 whispering wheat, under the passionless stars, in the
 dreaming night, it had turned into a blessing. He asked
 nothing but to serve. To serve her, his country, his
 future! All at once he who had always yearned for something
 unattainable had greatness thrust upon him. His tragical
 situation had evoked a spirit from the gods.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">To kiss that blue-eyed girl's sweet
 lips would be a sum of joy, earthly, all-satisfying,
 precious. The man in him trembled all over at the daring
 thought. He might revel in such dreams, and surrender to
 them, since she would never know, but the divinity he
 sensed there in the presence of those stars did not dwell
 on a woman's lips. Kisses were for the present, the all too
 fleeting present; and he had to concern himself with what
 he might do for one girl's future. It was exquisitely sad
 and sweet to put it that way, though Kurt knew that if he
 had never seen Lenore Anderson he would have gone to war
 just the same. He was not making an abstract sacrifice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The wheat-fields rolling before him,
 every clod of which had been pressed by his bare feet as a
 boy; the father whose changeless blood had sickened at the
 son of his loins; the life of hope, freedom, of action, of
 achievement, of wonderful possibility?these seemed
 lost to Kurt Dorn, a necessary renunciation when he yielded
 to the call of war.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But no loss, no sting of bullet or
 bayonet, no torturing victory of approaching death, could
 balance in the scale against the thought of a picture of
 one American girl?blue-eyed, red-lipped,
 golden-haired?as she stepped somewhere in the future,
 down a summer lane or through a blossoming orchard, on soil
 that was free.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Toward the end of July eastern
 Washington sweltered under the most torrid spell of heat on
 record. It was a dry, high country, noted for an equable
 climate, with cool summers and mild winters. And this
 unprecedented wave would have been unbearable had not the
 atmosphere been free from humidity.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The haze of heat seemed like a pall of
 thin smoke from distant forest fires. The sun rose, a
 great, pale-red ball, hot at sunrise, and it soared
 blazing-white at noon, to burn slowly westward through a
 cloudless, coppery sky, at last to set sullen and crimson
 over the ranges.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Spokane, being the only center of
 iron, steel, brick, and masonry in this area, resembled a
 city of furnaces. Business was slack. The asphalt of the
 streets left clean imprints of a pedestrian's feet; bits of
 newspaper stuck fast to the hot tar. Down by the gorge,
 where the great green river made its magnificent plunges
 over the falls, people congregated, tarried, and were loath
 to leave, for here the blowing mist and the air set into
 motion by the falling water created a temperature that was
 relief.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Citizens talked of the protracted hot
 spell, of the blasted crops, of an almost sure disaster to
 the wheat-fields, and of the activities of the I.W.W. Even
 the war, for the time being, gave place to the nearer
 calamities impending.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Montana had taken drastic measures
 against the invading I.W.W. The Governor of Idaho had sent
 word to the camps of the organization that they had five
 days to leave that state. Spokane was awakening to the
 menace of hordes of strange, idle men who came in on the
 westbound freight-trains. The railroads had been unable to
 handle the situation. They were being hard put to it to run
 trains at all. The train crews that refused to join the
 I.W.W. had been threatened, beaten, shot at, and otherwise
 intimidated.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chamber of Commerce sent an
 imperative appeal to representative wheat-raisers,
 ranchers, lumbermen, farmers, and bade them come to Spokane
 to discuss the situation. They met at the Hotel Davenport,
 where luncheon was served in one of the magnificently
 appointed dining-halls of that most splendid hotel in the
 West.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The lion of this group of Spokane
 capitalists was Riesinberg, a man of German forebears, but
 all American in his sympathies, with a son already in the
 army. Riesinberg was president of a city bank and of the
 Chamber of Commerce. His first words to the large assembly
 of clean-cut, square-jawed, intent-eyed Westerners were:
 "Gentlemen, we are here to discuss the most threatening and
 unfortunate situation the Northwest was ever called upon to
 meet." His address was not long, but it was stirring. The
 Chamber of Commerce could provide unlimited means, could
 influence and control the state government; but it was from
 the visitors invited to this meeting, the men of the
 outlying districts which were threatened, that objective
 proofs must come and the best methods of procedure.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The first facts to come out were that
 many crops were ruined already, but, owing to the increased
 acreage that year, a fair yield was expected; that wheat in
 the Bend would be a failure, though some farmers here and
 there would harvest well; that the lumber districts were
 not operating, on account of the I.W.W.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then it was that the organization of
 men who called themselves the Industrial Workers of the
 World drew the absorbed attention of the meeting.
 Depredations already committed stunned the members of the
 Chamber of Commerce.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">President Riesinberg called upon
 Beardsley, a prominent and intelligent rancher of the
 southern wheat-belt. Beardsley said:</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"It is difficult to speak with any
 moderation of the outrageous eruption of the I.W.W. It is
 nothing less than rebellion, and the most effective means
 of suppressing rebellion is to apply a little of that
 'direct action' which is the favorite diversion of the
 I.W.W.'s.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"The I.W.W. do not intend to accomplish
 their treacherous aims by anything so feeble as speech;
 they scorn the ballot-box. They are against the war, and
 their method of making known their protest is by burning
 our grain, destroying our lumber, and blowing up
 freight-trains. They seek to make converts not by argument,
 but by threats and intimidation.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"We read that Western towns are seeking
 to deport these rebels. In the old days we can imagine more
 drastic measures would have been taken. The Westerners were
 handy with the rope and the gun in those days. We are not
 counseling lynch law, but we think deportation is too mild
 a punishment.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"We are too 'civilized' to apply the
 old Roman law, 'Spare the conquered and extirpate the
 rebels,' but at least we could intern them. The British
 have found it practicable to put German prisoners to work
 at useful employment. Why couldn't we do the same with our
 rebel I.W.W.'s?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jones, a farmer from the Yakima
 Valley, told that business men, housewives, professional
 men, and high-school boys and girls would help to save the
 crop of Washington to the nation in case of labor trouble.
 Steps already had been taken to mobilize workers in stores,
 offices, and homes for work in the orchards and
 grain-fields, should the I.W.W. situation seriously
 threaten harvests.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Pledges to go into the hay or grain
 fields or the orchards, with a statement of the number of
 days they were willing to work, had been signed by
 virtually all the men in North Yakima.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Helmar, lumberman from the Blue
 Mountains, spoke feelingly; he said:</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"My company is the owner of a
 considerable amount of timbered lands and timber purchased
 from the state and from individuals. We have been engaged
 in logging that land until our operations have been stopped
 and our business paralyzed by an organization which calls
 itself the Industrial Workers of the World, and by members
 of that organization, and other lawless persons acting in
 sympathy with them.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Our employees have been threatened
 with physical violence and death.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Our works are picketed by individuals
 who camp out in the forests and who intimidate and threaten
 our employees.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Open threats have been made that our
 works, our logs, and our timber will all be burned.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Sabotage is publicly preached in the
 meetings, and in the literature of the organization it is
 advised and upheld.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"The open boast is made that the
 lumbering industry, with all other industry, will be
 paralyzed by this organization, by the destruction of
 property used in industry and by the intimidation of
 laborers who are willing to work.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"A real and present danger to the
 property of my company exists. Unless protection is given
 to us it will probably be burned and destroyed. Our lawful
 operations cannot be conducted because laborers who are
 willing to work are fearful of their lives and are subject
 to abuse, threats, and violence. Our camps, when in
 operation, are visited by individuals belonging to the said
 organization, and the men peaceably engaged in them
 threatened with death if they do not cease work. All sorts
 of injury to property by the driving of spikes in logs, the
 destruction of logs, and other similar acts are encouraged
 and recommended.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"As I pointed out to the sheriff of our
 county, the season is a very dry one and the woods are and
 will be, unless rain comes, in danger of disastrous fires.
 The organization and its members have openly and repeatedly
 asserted that they will burn the logs in the woods and burn
 the forests of this company and other timber-holders before
 they will permit logging operations to continue.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Many individuals belonging to the
 organization are camped in the open in the timbered
 country, and their very presence is a fire menace. They are
 engaged in no business except to interfere with the
 industry and to interfere with the logging of this company
 and others who engaged in the logging business.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"We have done what we could in a lawful
 manner to continue our operations and to protect our
 employees. We are now helpless, and place the
 responsibility for the protection of our property and the
 protection of our employees upon the board of county
 commissioners and upon the officers of the county."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Next President Riesinberg called upon
 a young reporter to read paragraphs of an I.W.W. speech he
 had heard made to a crowd of three hundred workmen. It was
 significant that several members of the Chamber of Commerce
 called for a certain paragraph to be reread. It was
 this:</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"If you working-men could only stand
 together you could do in this country what has been done in
 Russia," declared the I.W.W. orator. "You know what the
 working-men did there to the slimy curs, the gunmen, and
 the stool-pigeons of the capitalistic class. They bumped
 them off. They sent them up to say, 'Good morning,
 Jesus.'"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">After a moment of muttering and
 another silence the president again addressed the
 meeting:</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Gentlemen, we have Anderson of Golden
 Valley with us to-day. If there are any of you present who
 do not know him, you surely have heard of him. His people
 were pioneers. He was born in Washington. He is a type of
 the men who have made the Northwest. He fought the Indians
 in early days and packed a gun for the outlaws?and
 to-day, gentlemen, he owns a farm as big as Spokane County.
 We want to hear from him."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When Anderson rose to reply it was
 seen that he was pale and somber. Slowly he gazed at the
 assembly of waiting men, bowed; then he began,
 impressively:</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Gentlemen an' friends, I wish I didn't
 have to throw a bomb into this here camp-fire talk. But
 I've got to. You're all talkin' I.W.W. Facts have been told
 showin' a strange an' sudden growth of this here four-flush
 labor union. We've had dealin's with them for several
 years. But this year it's different.? All at once
 they've multiplied and strengthened. There's somethin'
 behind them. A big unseen hand is stackin' the deck.?
 An', countrymen, that tremendous power is German gold!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson's deep voice rang like a
 bell. His hearers sat perfectly silent. No surprise showed,
 but faces grew set and hard. After a pause of suspense, in
 which his denunciation had time to sink in, Anderson
 resumed:</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"A few weeks ago a young man, a
 stranger, came to me an' asked for a job. He could do
 anythin', he said. An' I hired him to drive my car. But he
 wasn't much of a driver. We went up in the Bend country one
 day, an' on that trip I got suspicious of him. I caught him
 talkin' to what I reckoned was I.W.W. men. An' then, back
 home again, I watched him an' kept my ears open. It didn't
 take long for me to find discontent among my farm-hands. I
 hire about a hundred hands on my ranches durin' the long
 off season, an' when harvest comes round a good many more.
 All I can get, in fact.? Well, I found my hands
 quittin' me, which was sure onusual. An' I laid it to that
 driver.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"One day not long ago I run across him
 hobnobbin' with the strange man I'd seen talkin' with him
 on the Bend trip. But my driver?Nash, he calls
 himself?didn't see me. That night I put a cowboy to
 watch him. An' what this cowboy heard, put together two an'
 two, was that Nash was assistant to an I.W.W. leader named
 Glidden. He had sent for Glidden to come to look over my
 ranch. Both these I.W.W. men had more money than they could
 well carry?lots of it gold! The way they talked of
 this money proved that they did not know the source, but
 the supply was unlimited.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Next day Glidden could not be found.
 But my cowboy had learned enough to show his methods. If
 these proselyters could not coax or scare trusted men to
 join the I.W.W., they tried to corrupt them with money. An'
 in most cases they're successful. I've not yet sprung
 anythin' on my driver, Nash. But he can't get away, an'
 meanwhile I'll learn much by watchin' him. Maybe through
 Nash I can catch Glidden. An' so, gentlemen, here we have a
 plain case. An' the menace is enough to chill the heart of
 every loyal citizen. Any way you put it, if harvests can't
 be harvested, if wheat-fields an' lumber forests are
 burned, if the state militia has to be called out?any
 way you put it our government will be hampered, our
 supplies kept from our allies?an' so the cause of
 Germany will be helped.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"The I.W.W. have back of them an
 organized power with a definite purpose. There can hardly
 be any doubt that that power is Germany. The agitators an'
 leaders throughout the country are well paid. Probably
 they, as individuals, do not know who pays them.
 Undoubtedly a little gang of men makes the deals, handles
 the money. We read that every U.S. attorney is
 investigating the I.W.W. The government has determined to
 close down on them. But lawyers an' law are slow to act.
 Meanwhile the danger to us is at hand.</p><br>

 <p class="NormalBQ">"Gentlemen, to finish let me say that
 down in my country we're goin' to rustle the I.W.W. in the
 good old Western way."</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Golden Valley was the Garden of Eden
 of the Northwest. The southern slope rose to the Blue
 Mountains, whence flowed down the innumerable brooks that,
 uniting to form streams and rivers, abundantly watered the
 valley.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The black reaches of timber extended
 down to the grazing-uplands, and these bordered on the
 sloping golden wheat-fields, which in turn contrasted so
 vividly with the lower green alfalfa-pastures; then came
 the orchards with their ruddy, mellow fruit, and lastly the
 bottom-lands where the vegetable-gardens attested to the
 wonderful richness of the soil. From the mountain-side the
 valley seemed a series of colored benches, stepping down,
 black to gray, and gray to gold, and gold to green with
 purple tinge, and on to the perfectly ordered, many-hued
 floor with its innumerable winding, tree-bordered streams
 glinting in the sunlight.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The extremes of heat and cold never
 visited Golden Valley. Spokane and the Bend country, just
 now sweltering in a torrid zone, might as well have been in
 the Sahara, for all the effect it had on this garden spot
 of all the Inland Empire. It was hot in the valley, but not
 unpleasant. In fact, the greatest charm in this secluded
 vale was its pleasant climate all the year round. No summer
 cyclones, no winter blizzards, no cloudbursts or bad
 thunderstorms. It was a country that, once lived in, could
 never be left.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no poor inhabitants in that
 great area of twenty-five hundred miles; and there were
 many who were rich. Prosperous little towns dotted the
 valley floor; and the many smooth, dusty, much-used roads
 all led to Ruxton, a wealthy and fine city.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson, the rancher, had driven his
 car to Spokane. Upon his return he had with him a
 detective, whom he expected to use in the I.W.W.
 investigations, and a neighbor rancher. They had left
 Spokane early and had endured almost insupportable dust and
 heat. A welcome change began as they slid down from the
 bare desert into the valley; and once across the Copper
 River, Anderson began to breathe freer and to feel he was
 nearing home.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"God's country!" he said, as he struck
 the first low swell of rising land, where a cool wind from
 off the wooded and watered hills greeted his face. Dust
 there still was, but it seemed a different kind and smelled
 of apple-orchards and alfalfa-fields. Here were hard,
 smooth roads, and Anderson sped his car miles and miles
 through a country that was a verdant fragrant bower, and
 across bright, shady streams and by white little
 hamlets.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At Huntington he dropped his neighbor
 rancher, and also the detective, Hall, who was to go
 disguised into the districts overrun by the I.W.W. A
 further run of forty miles put him on his own property.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson owned a string of farms and
 ranches extending from the bottom-lands to the timber-line
 of the mountains. They represented his life of hard work
 and fair dealing. Many of these orchard and vegetable lands
 he had tenant farmers work on shares. The uplands or wheat
 and grass he operated himself. As he had accumulated
 property he had changed his place of residence from time to
 time, at last to build a beautiful and permanent home
 farther up on the valley slope than any of the others.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was a modern house, white, with a
 red roof. Situated upon a high level bench, with the waving
 gold fields sloping up from it and the green squares of
 alfalfa and orchards below, it appeared a landmark from all
 around, and could be plainly seen from Vale, the nearest
 little town, five miles away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson had always loved the open,
 and he wanted a place where he could see the sun rise over
 the distant valley gateway, and watch it set beyond the
 bold black range in the west. He could sit on his front
 porch, wide and shady, and look down over two thousand
 acres of his own land. But from the back porch no eye could
 have encompassed the limit of his broad, swelling slopes of
 grain and grass.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">From the main road he drove up to the
 right of the house, where, under a dip of wooded slope,
 clustered barns, sheds, corrals, granaries, engine and
 machinery houses, a store, and the homes of hired
 men?a little village in itself.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The sounds he heard were a welcome
 home?the rush of swift water not twenty yards from
 where he stopped the car in the big courtyard, the pound of
 hoofs on the barn floor, the shrill whistle of a stallion
 that saw and recognized him, the drawling laugh of his
 cowboys and the clink of their spurs as they became aware
 of his return.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash, the suspected driver, was among
 those who hurried to meet the car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson's keen, covert glance made
 note of the driver's worried and anxious face.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nash, she'll need a lookin' over," he
 said, as he uncovered bundles in the back seat and lifted
 them out.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All right, sir," replied Nash,
 eagerly. A note of ended strain was significant in his
 voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Here, you Jake," cheerily called
 Anderson to a raw-boned, gaunt-faced fellow who wore the
 garb of a cowboy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boss, I'm powerful glad to see you
 home," replied Jake, as he received bundle after bundle
 until he was loaded down. Then he grinned. "Mebbe you want
 a pack-boss."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You're hoss enough for me. Come on,"
 he said, and, waving the other men aside, he turned toward
 the green, shady hill above which the red and white of the
 house just showed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A bridge crossed the rushing stream.
 Here Jake dropped some of the bundles, and Anderson
 recovered them. As he straightened up he looked searchingly
 at the cowboy. Jake's yellow-gray eyes returned the gaze.
 And that exchange showed these two of the same breed and
 sure of each other.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nawthin' come off, boss," he drawled,
 "but I'm glad you're home."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Did Nash leave the place?" queried
 Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Twice, at night, an' he was gone
 long. I didn't foller him because I seen he didn't take no
 luggage, an' thet boy has some sporty clothes. He was sure
 comin' back."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Any sign of his pard?that
 Glidden?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nope. But there's been more'n one new
 feller snookin' round."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Have you heard from any of the boys
 with the cattle?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yep. Bill Weeks rode down. He said a
 bunch of I.W.W.'s were campin' above Blue Spring. Thet
 means they've moved on down to the edge of the timber an'
 oncomfortable near our wheat. Bill says they're killin' our
 stock fer meat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hum!? How many in the gang?"
 inquired Anderson, darkly. His early dealings with outlaw
 rustlers had not left him favorably inclined toward losing
 a single steer.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, I reckon we can't say. Mebbe
 five hundred, countin' all along the valley on this side.
 Then we hear there's more on the other? Boss, if they
 git ugly we're goin' to lose stock, wheat, an' mebbe some
 blood."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So many as that!" ejaculated the
 rancher, in amaze.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"They come an' go, an' lately they're
 most comin'," replied Jake.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"When do we begin cuttin' grain?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon to-morrow. Adams didn't want
 to start till you got back. It'll be barley an' oats fer a
 few days, an' then the wheat?if we can git the
 men."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"An' has Adams hired any?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, a matter of twenty or so. They
 swore they wasn't I.W.W.'s, but Adams says, an' so do I,
 thet some of them are men who first claimed to our old
 hands thet they did belong to the I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"An' so we've got to take a chance if
 we're goin' to harvest two thousand acres of wheat?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon, boss."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Any reports from Ruxton way?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, yes. But I reckon you'd better
 git your supper 'fore I tell you, boss."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, you said nothin' had come
 off."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, nawthin' has around here. Come
 on now, boss. Miss Lenore says I was to keep my mouth
 shut."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, who's your boss? Me or
 Lenore?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, you air. But I ain't disobeyin'
 Miss Lenore."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson walked the rest of the way up
 the shady path to the house without saying any more to
 Jake. The beautiful white house stood clear of the grove,
 bright in the rays of the setting sun. A barking of dogs
 greeted Anderson, and then the pattering of feet. His
 daughters appeared on the porch. Kathleen, who was ten,
 made a dive for him, and Rose, who was fourteen, came
 flying after her. Both girls were screaming joyously. Their
 sunny hair danced. Lenore waited for him at the step, and
 as he mounted the porch, burdened by the three girls, his
 anxious, sadly smiling wife came out to make perfect the
 welcome home. No?not perfect, for Anderson's joy held
 a bitter drop, the absence of his only son!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, dad, what-all did you fetch me?"
 cried Kathleen, and she deserted her father for the
 bundle-laden Jake.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"And me!" echoed Rose.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Even Lenore, in the happiness of her
 father's return, was not proof against the wonder and
 promise of those many bundles.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">They all went within, through a hall
 to a great, cozy living-room. Mrs. Anderson's very first
 words, after her welcoming smile, were a half-faltered:</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Any?news of?Jim?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why?yes," replied Anderson,
 hesitatingly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly the three sisters were
 silent. How closely they resembled one another
 then?Lenore, a budding woman; Rose, a budding girl;
 and Kathleen, a rosy, radiant child! Lenore lost a little
 of her bloom.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What news, father?" she asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Haven't you heard from him?" returned
 Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not for a whole week. He wrote the
 day he reached Spokane. But then he hardly knew anything
 except that he'd enlisted."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm sure glad Jim didn't wait for the
 draft," replied the father. "Well, mother an' girls, Jim
 was gone when I got to Spokane. All I heard was that he was
 well when he left for Frisco an' strong for the aviation
 corps."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Then he means to?to be an
 aviator," said Lenore, with quivering lips.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure, if he can get in. An' he's
 wise. Jim knows engines. He has a knack for machinery. An'
 nerve! No boy ever had more. He'll make a crack flier."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But?the danger!" whispered the
 boy's mother, with a shudder.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon there'll be a little danger,
 mother," replied Anderson, cheerfully. "We've got to take
 our chance on Jim. There's one sure bet. If he had stayed
 home he'd been fightin' I.W.W.'s!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That trying moment passed. Mrs.
 Anderson said that she would see to supper being put on the
 table at once. The younger girls began untying the bundles.
 Lenore studied her father's face a moment.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, you run along," she said to the
 waiting cowboy. "Wait till after supper before you worry
 father."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll do thet, Miss Lenore," drawled
 Jake, "an' if he wants worryin' he'll hev to look me
 up."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lass, I'm only tired, not worried,"
 replied Anderson, as Jake shuffled out with jingling
 spurs.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Did anything serious happen in
 Spokane?" she asked anxiously.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. But Spokane men are alive to
 serious trouble ahead," replied her father. "I spoke to the
 Chamber of Commerce?sure exploded a bomb in that
 camp. Then I had conferences with a good many different
 men. Fact is they ran me pretty hard. Couldn't have slept
 much, anyhow, in that heat. Lass, this is the place to
 live!? I'd rather die here than live in Spokane, in
 summer."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Did you see the Governor?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, an' he wasn't as anxious about
 the Golden Valley as the Bend country. He's right, too.
 We're old Westerners here. We can handle trouble. But
 they're not Americans up there in the Bend."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father, we met one American," said
 Lenore, dreamily.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"By George! we did!? An' that
 reminds me. There was a government official from
 Washington, come out to Spokane to investigate conditions.
 I forget his name. He asked to meet me an' he was curious
 about the Bend?its loyalty to the U.S. I told him all
 I knew an' what I thought. An' then he said he was goin' to
 motor through that wheat-belt an' talk to what Americans he
 could find, an' impress upon them that they could do as
 much as soldiers to win the war.
 Wheat?bread?that's our great gun in this war,
 Lenore!? I knew this, but I was made pretty blamed
 sober by that government man. I told him by all means to go
 to Palmer an' to have a talk with young Dorn. I sure gave
 that boy a good word. Poor lad! He's true blue. An' to
 think of him with that old German devil. Old Dorn has
 always had a hard name. An' this war has brought out the
 German cussedness."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father, I'm glad you spoke well of
 the young man," said Lenore, still dreamily.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hum! You never told me what you
 thought," replied her father, with a quick glance of
 inquiry at her. Lenore was gazing out of the window, away
 across the wheat-fields and the range. Anderson watched her
 a moment, and then resumed: "If I can get away I'm goin' to
 drive up to see Dorn again pretty soon. Do you want to
 go?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore gave a little start, as if the
 question had surprised her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I?I hardly think so," she
 replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's just as well," he said. "That'll
 be a hard ride.? Guess I'll clean up a little for
 supper."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson left the room, and, while
 Kathleen and Rose gleefully squabbled over the bundles,
 Lenore continued to gaze dreamily out of the window.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That night Lenore went early to her
 room, despite the presence of some young people from a
 neighboring village. She locked her door and sat in the
 dark beside her open window.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">An early moon silvered the long slopes
 of wheat and made the alfalfa squares seem black. A cool,
 faint, sweet breeze fanned her cheek. She could smell the
 fragrance of apples, of new-mown hay, and she could hear
 the low murmur of running water. A hound bayed off
 somewhere in the fields. There was no other sound. It was a
 quiet, beautiful, pastoral scene. But somehow it did not
 comfort Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She seemed to doubt the sincerity of
 what she saw there and loved so well. Moon-blanched and
 serene, lonely and silent, beautiful and promising, the
 wide acres of "Many Waters," and the silver slopes and dark
 mountains beyond, did not tell the truth. 'Way over the
 dark ranges a hideous war had stretched out a red hand to
 her country. Her only brother had left his home to fight,
 and there was no telling if he would ever come back. Evil
 forces were at work out there in the moonlight. There had
 come a time for her to be thoughtful.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Her father's asking her to ride to the
 Bend country had caused some strange little shock of
 surprise. Lenore had dreamed without thinking. Here in the
 darkness and silence, watching the crescent moon slowly
 sink, she did think. And it was to learn that she
 remembered singularly well the first time she had seen
 young Dorn, and still more vividly the second time, but the
 third time seemed both clear and vague. Enough young men
 had been smitten with Lenore to enable her to gauge the
 symptoms of these easy-come, easy-go attractions. In fact,
 they rather repelled her. But she had found Dorn's manner
 striking, confusing, and unforgettable. And why that should
 be so interested her intelligence.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was confusing to discover that she
 could not lay it to the sympathy she had felt for an
 American boy in a difficult position, because she had often
 thought of him long before she had any idea who he was or
 where he lived.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">In the very first place, he had been
 unforgettable for two reasons?because he had been so
 struck at sight of her that he had gazed unconsciously,
 with a glow on his face and a radiance in his eye, as of a
 young poet spellbound at an inspiration; and because he
 seemed the physical type of young man she had
 idealized?a strong, lithe-limbed, blond giant, with a
 handsome, frank face, clear-cut and smooth, ruddy-cheeked
 and blue-eyed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Only after meeting him out there in
 the desert of wheat had she felt sympathy for him. And now
 with intelligence and a woman's intuition, barring the old,
 insidious, dreamy mood, Lenore went over in retrospect all
 she could remember of that meeting. And the truth made her
 sharply catch her breath. Dorn had fallen in love with her.
 Intuition declared that, while her intelligence repudiated
 it. Stranger than all was the thrill which began somewhere
 in the unknown depths of her and mounted, to leave her
 tingling all over. She had told her father that she did not
 want to ride to the Bend country. But she did want to go!
 And that thought, flashing up, would not be denied. To want
 to meet a strange young man again was absolutely a new and
 irritating discovery for Lenore. It mystified her, because
 she had not had time to like Dorn. Liking an acquaintance
 had nothing to do with the fact. And that stunned her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Could it be?love at first
 sight?" she whispered, incredulously, as she stared out
 over the shadowing fields.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"For me? Why, how
 absurd?impossible!? I?I only remembered
 him?a big handsome boy with blazing eyes.? And
 now I'm sorry for him!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">To whisper her amaze and doubt and
 consternation only augmented the instinctive recurring
 emotion. She felt something she could not explain. And that
 something was scarcely owing to this young man's pitiful
 position between duty to his father and love for his
 country. It had to do with his blazing eyes; intangible,
 dreamlike perceptions of him as not real, of vague sweet
 fancies that retreated before her introspective
 questioning. What alarmed Lenore was a tendency of her mind
 to shirk this revealing analysis. Never before had she been
 afraid to look into herself. But now she was finding
 unplumbed wells of feeling, secret chambers of dreams into
 which she had never let the light, strange instinctive
 activities, more physical than mental. When in her life
 before had she experienced a nameless palpitation of her
 heart?</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Long she sat there, staring out into
 the night. And the change in the aspect of the broad
 spaces, now dark and impenetrable and mysterious, seemed
 like the change in the knowledge of herself. Once she had
 flattered herself that she was an inch of crystal water;
 now she seemed a complex, aloof, and contrary creature,
 almost on the verge of tumultuous emotions.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She said her prayers that night, a
 girlish habit resumed since her brother had declared his
 intention of enlisting in the army. And to that old prayer,
 which her mother had prayed before her, she added an appeal
 of her own. Strange that young Dorn's face should flash out
 of gloom! It was there, and her brother's was fading.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I wonder?will he and
 Jim?meet over there?on the battle-field!" she
 whispered. She hoped they would. Like tigers those boys
 would fight the Germans. Her heart beat high. Then a cold
 wind seemed to blow over her. It had a sickening weight. If
 that icy and somber wind could have been traced to its
 source, then the mystery of life would have been clear. But
 that source was the cause of war, as its effect was the
 horror of women. A hideous and monstrous thing existed out
 there in the darkness. Lenore passionately loved her
 brother, and this black thing had taken him away. Why could
 not women, who suffered most, have some word in the
 regulation of events? If women could help govern the world
 there would be no wars.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At last encroaching drowsiness dulled
 the poignancy of her feelings and she sank to sleep.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Singing of birds at her window
 awakened Lenore. The dawn streamed in bright and sweetly
 fragrant. The wheat-fields seemed a rosy gold, and all that
 open slope called to her thrillingly of the beauty of the
 world and the happiness of youth. It was not possible to be
 morbid at dawn. "I hear! I hear!" she whispered. "From a
 thousand slopes far and wide!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At the breakfast-table, when there
 came opportunity, she looked up serenely and said, "Father,
 on second thought I will go the Bend, thank you!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson laid down his knife and fork
 and his eyes opened wide in surprise. "Changed your mind!"
 he exclaimed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's a privilege I have, you know,"
 she replied, calmly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Mrs. Anderson appeared more anxious
 than surprised. "Daughter, don't go. That will be a fearful
 ride."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hum! Sure glad to have you, lass,"
 added Anderson, with his keen eyes on her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Let me go, too," begged Rose.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kathleen was solemnly gazing at
 Lenore, with the wise, penetrating eyes of extreme
 youth.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lenore, I'll bet you've got a new
 beau up there," she declared.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore flushed scarlet. She was less
 angry with her little sister than with the incomprehensible
 fact of a playful word bringing the blood stingingly to her
 neck and face.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Kitty, you forget your manners," she
 said, sharply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Kit is fresh. She's an awful child,"
 added Rose, with a superior air.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I didn't say a thing," cried
 Kathleen, hotly. "Lenore, if it isn't true, why'd you blush
 so red?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hush, you silly children!" ordered
 the mother, reprovingly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore was glad to finish that meal
 and to get outdoors. She could smile now at that shrewd and
 terrible Kitty, but recollection of her father's keen eyes
 was confusing. Lenore felt there was really nothing to
 blush for; still, she could scarcely tell her father that
 upon awakening this morning she had found her mind made
 up?that only by going to the Bend country could she
 determine the true state of her feelings. She simply dared
 not accuse herself of being in unusually radiant spirits
 because she was going to undertake a long, hard ride into a
 barren, desert country.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The grave and thoughtful mood of last
 night had gone with her slumbers. Often Lenore had found
 problems decided for her while she slept. On this fresh,
 sweet summer morning, with the sun bright and warm,
 presaging a hot and glorious day, Lenore wanted to run with
 the winds, to wade through the alfalfa, to watch with
 strange and renewed pleasure the waves of shadow as they
 went over the wheat. All her life she had known and loved
 the fields of waving gold. But they had never been to her
 what they had become overnight. Perhaps this was because it
 had been said that the issue of the great war, the
 salvation of the world, and its happiness, its hope,
 depended upon the millions of broad acres of golden grain.
 Bread was the staff of life. Lenore felt that she was
 changing and growing. If anything should happen to her
 brother Jim she would be heiress to thousands of acres of
 wheat. A pang shot through her heart. She had to drive the
 cold thought away. And she must learn?must know the
 bigness of this question. The women of the country would be
 called upon to help, to do their share.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She ran down through the grove and
 across the bridge, coming abruptly upon Nash, her father's
 driver. He had the car out.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good morning," he said, with a smile,
 doffing his cap.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore returned his greeting and asked
 if her father intended to go anywhere.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. I'm taking telegrams to
 Huntington."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Telegrams? What's the matter with the
 'phone?" she queried.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wire was cut yesterday."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"By I.W.W. men?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So your father says. I don't
 know."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Something ought to be done to those
 men," said Lenore, severely.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash was a dark-browed, heavy-jawed
 young man, with light eyes and hair. He appeared to be
 intelligent and had some breeding, but his manner when
 alone with Lenore?he had driven her to town several
 times?was not the same as when her father was
 present. Lenore had not bothered her mind about it. But
 to-day the look in his eyes was offensive to her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Between you and me, Lenore, I've
 sympathy for those poor devils," he said.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore drew back rather haughtily at
 this familiar use of her first name. "It doesn't concern
 me," she said, coldly and turned away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Won't you ride along with me? I'm
 driving around for the mail," he called after her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No," returned Lenore, shortly, and
 hurried on out of earshot. The impertinence of the
 fellow!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mawnin', Miss Lenore!" drawled a
 cheery voice. The voice and the jingle of spurs behind her
 told Lenore of the presence of the best liked of all her
 father's men.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good morning, Jake! Where's my
 dad?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, he's with Adams, an' I wouldn't
 be Adams for no money," replied the cowboy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Neither would I," laughed Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Reckon you ain't ridin' this mawnin'.
 You sure look powerful fine, Miss Lenore, but you can't
 ride in thet dress."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, nothing but an aeroplane would
 satisfy me to-day."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Want to fly, hey? Wal, excuse me from
 them birds. I seen one, an' thet's enough for me.?
 An', changin' the subject, Miss Lenore, beggin' your
 pardon?you ain't ridin' in the car much these
 days."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, Jake, I'm not," she replied, and
 looked at the cowboy. She would have trusted Jake as she
 would her brother Jim. And now he looked earnest.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, I'm sure glad. I heerd Nash call
 an' ask you to go with him. I seen his eyes when he said
 it.? Sure I know you'd never look at the likes of
 him. But I want to tell you?he ain't no good. I've
 been watchin' him. Your dad's orders. He's mixed up with
 the I.W.W.'s. But thet ain't what I mean.
 It's?He's?I?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Thank you, Jake," replied Lenore, as
 the cowboy floundered. "I appreciate your thought of me.
 But you needn't worry."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I was worryin' a little," he said.
 "You see, I know men better 'n your dad, an' I reckon this
 Nash would do anythin'."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's father keeping him for?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, Anderson wants to find out a lot
 about thet I.W.W., an' he ain't above takin' risks to do
 it, either."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The stable-boys and men Lenore passed
 all had an eager good morning for her. She often boasted to
 her father that she could run "Many Waters" as well as he.
 Sometimes there were difficulties that Lenore had no little
 part in smoothing over. The barns and corrals were familiar
 places to her, and she insisted upon petting every horse,
 in some instances to Jake's manifest concern.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Some of them bosses are bad," he
 insisted.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"To be sure they are?when wicked
 cowboys cuff and kick them," replied Lenore,
 laughingly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, if I'm wicked, I'm a-goin' to
 war," said Jake, reflectively. "Them Germans bother
 me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But, Jake, you don't come in the
 draft age, do you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jest how old do you think I am?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sometimes about fourteen, Jake."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Much obliged. Wal, the fact is I'm
 over age, but I'll gamble I can pack a gun an' shoot as
 straight an' eat as much as any young feller."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll bet so, too, Jake. But I hope
 you won't go. We absolutely could not run this ranch
 without you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure I knew thet. Wal then, I reckon
 I'll hang around till you're married, Miss Lenore," he
 drawled.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Again the scarlet mantled Lenore's
 cheeks.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good. We'll have many harvests then,
 Jake, and many rides," she replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Aw, I don't know?" he
 began.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But Lenore ran away so that she could
 hear no more.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's the matter with me that
 people?that Jake should??" she began, and ended
 with a hand on each soft, hot cheek. There was something
 different about her, that seemed certain. And if her eyes
 were as bright as the day, with its deep blue and white
 clouds and shining green and golden fields, then any one
 might think what he liked and have proof for his
 tormenting.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But married! I? Not much. Do I want a
 husband getting shot?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The path Lenore trod so lightly led
 along a great peach and apple orchard where the trees were
 set far apart and the soil was cultivated, so that not a
 weed nor a blade of grass showed. The fragrance of fruit in
 the air, however, did not come from this orchard, for the
 trees were young and the reddening fruit rare. Down the
 wide aisles she saw the thick and abundant green of the
 older orchards.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At length Lenore reached the
 alfalfa-fields, and here among the mounds of newly cut hay
 that smelled so fresh and sweet she wanted to roll, and she
 had to run. Two great wagons with four horses each were
 being loaded. Lenore knew all the workmen except one. Silas
 Warner, an old, gray-headed farmer, had been with her
 father as long as she could remember.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Whar you goin', lass?" he called, as
 he halted to wipe his red face with a huge bandana. "It's
 too hot to run the way you're a-doin'."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, Silas, it's a grand morning!" she
 replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, so 'tis! Pitchin' hay hyar made
 me think it was hot," he said, as she tripped on. "Now,
 lass, don't go up to the wheat-fields."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But Lenore heard heedlessly, and she
 ran on till she came to the uncut alfalfa, which impeded
 her progress. A wonderful space of green and purple
 stretched away before her, and into it she waded. It came
 up to her knees, rich, thick, soft, and redolent of blossom
 and ripeness. Hard tramping it soon got to be. She grew hot
 and breathless, and her legs ached from the force expended
 in making progress through the tangled hay. At last she was
 almost across the field, far from the cutters, and here she
 flung herself, to roll and lie flat and gaze up through the
 deep azure of sky, wonderingly, as if to penetrate its
 secret. And then she hid her face in the fragrant thickness
 that seemed to force a whisper from her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I wonder?how will I
 feel?when I see him?again.? Oh, I
 wonder!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The sound of the whispered words, the
 question, the inevitableness of something involuntary,
 proved traitors to her happy dreams, her assurance, her
 composure. She tried to burrow under the hay, to hide from
 that tremendous bright-blue eye, the sky. Suddenly she lay
 very quiet, feeling the strange glow and throb and race of
 her blood, sensing the mystery of her body, trying to trace
 the thrills, to control this queer, tremulous, internal
 state. But she found she could not think clearly; she could
 only feel. And she gave up trying. It was sweet to
 feel.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She rose and went on. Another field
 lay beyond, a gradual slope, covered with a new growth of
 alfalfa. It was a light green?a contrast to the rich
 darkness of that behind her. At the end of this field ran a
 swift little brook, clear and musical, open to the sky in
 places, and in others hidden under flowery banks. Birds
 sang from invisible coverts; a quail sent up clear
 flutelike notes; and a lark caroled, seemingly out of the
 sky.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore wet her feet crossing the
 brook, and, climbing the little knoll above, she sat down
 upon a stone to dry them in the sun. It had a burn that
 felt good. No matter how hot the sun ever got there, she
 liked it. Always there seemed air to breathe and the shade
 was pleasant.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">From this vantage-point, a favorite
 one with Lenore, she could see all the alfalfa-fields, the
 hill crowned by the beautiful white-and-red house, the
 acres of garden, and the miles of orchards. The grazing and
 grain fields began behind her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The brook murmured below her and the
 birds sang. She heard the bees humming by. The air out here
 was clear of scent of fruit and hay, and it bore a drier
 odor, not so sweet. She could see the workmen, first those
 among the alfalfa, and then the men, and women, too,
 bending over on the vegetable-gardens. Likewise she could
 see the gleam of peaches, apples, pears and plums?a
 colorful and mixed gleam, delightful to the eye.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Wet or dry, it seemed that her feet
 refused to stay still, and once again she was wandering. A
 gray, slate-colored field of oats invited her steps, and
 across this stretch she saw a long yellow slope of barley,
 where the men were cutting. Beyond waved the golden fields
 of wheat. Lenore imagined that when she reached them she
 would not desire to wander farther.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There were two machines cutting on the
 barley slope, one drawn by eight horses, and the other by
 twelve. When Lenore had crossed the oat-field she
 discovered a number of strange men lounging in the scant
 shade of a line of low trees that separated the fields.
 Here she saw Adams, the foreman; and he espied her at the
 same moment. He had been sitting down, talking to the men.
 At once he rose to come toward Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is your father with you?" he
 asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No; he's too slow for me," replied
 Lenore. "Who are these men?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"They're strangers looking for
 jobs."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I.W.W. men?" queried Lenore, in lower
 voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Surely must be," he replied. Adams
 was not a young, not a robust man, and he seemed to carry a
 burden of worry. "Your father said he would come right
 out."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I hope he doesn't," said Lenore,
 bluntly. "Father has a way with him, you know."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, I know. And it's the way we're
 needing here in the Valley," replied the foreman,
 significantly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is that the new harvester-thresher
 father just bought?" asked Lenore, pointing to the huge
 machine, shining and creeping behind the twelve horses.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, that's the McCormack and it's a
 dandy," returned Adams. "With machines like that we can get
 along without the I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I want a ride on it," declared
 Lenore, and she ran along to meet the harvester. She waved
 her hand to the driver, Bill Jones, another old hand, long
 employed by her father. Bill hauled back on the
 many-branched reins, and when the horses stopped the
 clattering, whirring roar of the machine also ceased.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Howdy, miss! Reckon this 's a regular
 I.W.W. hold-up."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Worse than that, Bill," gaily replied
 Lenore as she mounted the platform where another man sat on
 a bag of barley. Lenore did not recognize him. He looked
 rugged and honest, and beamed upon her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Watch out fer yer dress," he said,
 pointing with grimy hand to the dusty wheels and braces so
 near her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Let me drive, Bill?" she asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, now, I wisht I could," he
 replied, dryly. "You sure can drive, miss. But drivin'
 ain't all this here job."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What can't I do? I'll bet
 you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I never seen a girl that could throw
 anythin' straight. Did you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, not so very. I forgot how you
 drove the horses.? Go ahead. Don't let me delay the
 harvest."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Bill called sonorously to his twelve
 horses, and as they bent and strained and began to bob
 their heads, the clattering roar filled the air. Also a
 cloud of dust and thin, flying streams of chaff enveloped
 Lenore. The high stalks of barley, in wide sheets, fell
 before the cutter upon an apron, to be carried by feeders
 into the body of the machine. The straw, denuded of its
 grain, came out at the rear, to be dropped, while the grain
 streamed out of a tube on the side next to Lenore, to fall
 into an open sack. It made a short shift of harvesting.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore liked the even, nodding rhythm
 of the plodding horses, and the way Bill threw a pebble
 from a sack on his seat, to hit this or that horse not
 keeping in line or pulling his share. Bill's aim was
 unerring. He never hit the wrong horse, which would have
 been the case had he used a whip. The grain came out in so
 tiny a stream that Lenore wondered how a bag was ever
 filled. But she saw presently that even a tiny stream, if
 running steadily, soon made bulk. That was proof of the
 value of small things, even atoms.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">No marvel was it that Bill and his
 helper were as grimy as stokers of a furnace. Lenore began
 to choke with the fine dust and to feel her eyes smart and
 to see it settle on her hands and dress. She then had
 appreciation of the nature of a ten-hour day for workmen
 cutting eighteen acres of barley. How would they ever cut
 the two thousand acres of wheat? No wonder many men were
 needed. Lenore sympathized with the operators of that
 harvester-thresher, but she did not like the dirt. If she
 had been a man, though, that labor, hard as it was, would
 have appealed to her. Harvesting the grain was beautiful,
 whether in the old, slow method of threshing or with one of
 these modern man-saving machines.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She jumped off, and the big, ponderous
 thing, almost gifted with intelligence, it seemed to
 Lenore, rolled on with its whirring roar, drawing its cloud
 of dust, and leaving behind a litter of straw.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It developed then that Adams had
 walked along with the machine, and he now addressed
 her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Will you be staying here till your
 father comes?" he asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, Mr. Adams. Why do you ask?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You oughtn't come out here alone or
 go back alone.? All these strange men! Some of them
 hard customers! You'll excuse me, miss, but this harvest is
 not like other harvests."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll wait for my father and I'll not
 go out of sight," replied Lenore. Thanking the foreman for
 his thoughtfulness, she walked away, and soon she stood at
 the edge of the first wheat-field.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The grain was not yet ripe but near at
 hand it was a pale gold. The wind, out of the west, waved
 and swept the wheat, while the almost imperceptible shadows
 followed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A road half overgrown with grass and
 goldenrod bordered the wheat-field, and it wound away down
 toward the house. Her father appeared mounted on the white
 horse he always rode. Lenore sat down in the grass to wait
 for him. Nodding stalks of goldenrod leaned to her face.
 When looked at closely, how truly gold their color! Yet it
 was not such a gold as that of the rich blaze of ripe
 wheat. She was admitting to her consciousness a jealousy of
 anything comparable to wheat. And suddenly she confessed
 that her natural love for it had been augmented by a subtle
 growing sentiment. Not sentiment about the war or the need
 of the Allies or meaning of the staff of life. She had
 sensed young Dorn's passion for wheat and it had made a
 difference to her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No use lying to myself!" she
 soliloquized. "I think of him!.. I can't help it? I
 ran out here, wild, restless, unable to reason? just
 because I'd decided to see him again?to make sure
 I?I really didn't care.? How furious?how
 ridiculous I'll feel?when?when?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore did not complete her thought,
 because she was not sure. Nothing could be any truer than
 the fact that she had no idea how she would feel. She began
 sensitively to distrust herself. She who had always been so
 sure of motives, so contented with things as they were, had
 been struck by an absurd fancy that haunted because it was
 fiercely repudiated and scorned, that would give her no
 rest until it was proven false. But suppose it were
 true!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A succeeding blankness of mind awoke
 to the clip-clop of hoofs and her father's cheery
 halloo.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson dismounted and, throwing his
 bridle, he sat down heavily beside her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You can ride back home," he said.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore knew she had been reproved for
 her wandering out there, and she made a motion to rise. His
 big hand held her down.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No hurry, now I'm here. Grand day,
 ain't it? An' I see the barley's goin'. Them sacks look
 good to me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore waited with some perturbation.
 She had a guilty conscience and she feared he meant to quiz
 her about her sudden change of front regarding the Bend
 trip. So she could not look up and she could not say a
 word.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake says that Nash has been tryin'
 to make up to you. Any sense in what he says?" asked her
 father, bluntly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, hardly. Oh, I've noticed Nash
 is?is rather fresh, as Rose calls it," replied
 Lenore, somewhat relieved at this unexpected query.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, he's been makin' eyes at Rose.
 She told me," replied Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Discharge him," said Lenore,
 forcibly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So I ought. But let me tell you,
 Lenore. I've been hopin' to get Nash dead to rights."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What more do you want?" she
 demanded.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I mean regardin' his relation to the
 I.W.W.? Listen. Here's the point. Nash has been
 tracked an' caught in secret talks with prominent men in
 this country. Men of foreign blood an' mebbe foreign
 sympathies. We're at the start of big an' bad times in the
 good old U.S. No one can tell how bad. Well, you know my
 position in the Golden Valley. I'm looked to. Reckon this
 I.W.W. has got me a marked man. I'm packin' two guns right
 now. An' you bet Jake is packin' the same. We don't travel
 far apart any more this summer."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore had started shudderingly and
 her look showed her voiceless fear.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You needn't tell your mother," he
 went on, more intimately. "I can trust you an' ? To
 come back to Nash. He an' this Glidden?you remember,
 one of those men at Dorn's house?they are usin' gold.
 They must have barrels of it. If I could find out where
 that gold comes from! Probably they don't know. But I might
 find out if men here in our own country are hatchin' plots
 with the I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Plots! What for?" queried Lenore,
 breathlessly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"To destroy my wheat, to drive off or
 bribe the harvest-hands, to cripple the crop yield in the
 Northwest; to draw the militia here; in short, to harass
 an' weaken an' slow down our government in its preparation
 against Germany."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, that is terrible!" declared
 Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I've a hunch from Jake?there's
 a whisper of a plot to put me out of the way," said
 Anderson, darkly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh?good Heavens! You don't mean
 it!" cried Lenore, distractedly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure I do. But that's no way for
 Anderson's daughter to take it. Our women have got to
 fight, too. We've all got to meet these German hired devils
 with their own weapons. Now, lass, you know you'll get
 these wheatlands of mine some day. It's in my will. That's
 because you, like your dad, always loved the wheat. You'd
 fight, wouldn't you, to save your grain for our
 soldiers?bread for your own brother Jim?an' for
 your own land?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Fight! Would I?" burst out Lenore,
 with a passionate little cry.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good! Now you're talkin'!" exclaimed
 her father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll find out about this
 Nash?if you'll let me," declared Lenore, as if
 inspired.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"How? What do you mean, girl?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll encourage him. I'll make him
 think I'm a wishy-washy moonstruck girl, smitten with him.
 All's fair in war!? If he means ill by my
 father?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson muttered low under his breath
 and his big hand snapped hard at the nodding goldenrod.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"For my sake?to help
 me?you'd encourage Nash?flirt with him a
 little?find out all you could?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, I would!" she cried,
 deliberately. But she wanted to cover her face with her
 hands. She trembled slightly, then grew cold, with a
 sickening disgust at this strange, new, uprising self.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wait a minute before you say too
 much," went on Anderson. "You're my best-beloved child, my
 Lenore, the lass I've been so proud of all my life. I'd
 spill blood to avenge an insult to you.? But, Lenore,
 we've entered upon a terrible war. People out here,
 especially the women, don't realize it yet. But you must
 realize it. When I said good-by to Jim, my son, I?I
 felt I'd never look upon his face again!? I gave him
 up. I could have held him back?got exemption for him.
 But, no, by God! I gave him up?to make safety and
 happiness and prosperity for?say, your children, an'
 Rose's, an' Kathleen's.? I'm workin' now for the
 future. So must every loyal man an' every loyal woman! We
 love our own country. An' I ask you to see as I see the
 terrible danger to that country. Think of you an' Rose an'
 Kathleen bein' treated like those poor Belgian girls! Well,
 you'd get that an' worse if the Germans won this war. An'
 the point is, for us to win, every last one of us must
 fight, sacrifice to that end, an' hang together."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson paused huskily and swallowed
 hard while he looked away across the fields. Lenore felt
 herself drawn by an irresistible power. The west wind
 rustled through the waving wheat. She heard the whir of the
 threshers. Yet all seemed unreal. Her father's passion had
 made this place another world.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So much for that," resumed Anderson.
 "I'm goin' to do my best. An' I may make blunders. I'll
 play the game as it's dealt out to me. Lord knows I feel
 all in the dark. But it's the nature of the effort, the
 spirit, that'll count. I'm goin' to save most of the wheat
 on my ranches. An' bein' a Westerner who can see ahead, I
 know there's goin' to be blood spilled.? I'd give a
 lot to know who sent this Nash spyin' on me. I'm satisfied
 now he's an agent, a spy, a plotter for a gang that's
 marked me. I can't prove it yet, but I feel it. Maybe
 nothin' worth while?worth the trouble?will ever
 be found out from him. But I don't figure that way. I say
 play their own game an' take a chance.? If you
 encouraged Nash you'd probably find out all about him. The
 worst of it is could you be slick enough? Could a girl as
 fine an' square an' high-spirited as you ever double-cross
 a man, even a scoundrel like Nash? I reckon you could,
 considerin' the motive. Women are wonderful.? Well,
 if you can fool him, make him think he's a winner, flatter
 him till he swells up like a toad, promise to elope with
 him, be curious, jealous, make him tell where he goes, whom
 he meets, show his letters, all without ever sufferin' his
 hand on you, I'll give my consent. I'd think more of you
 for it. Now the question is, can you do it?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes," whispered Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good!" exploded Anderson, in a great
 relief. Then he began to mop his wet face. He arose,
 showing the weight of heavy guns in his pockets, and he
 gazed across the wheat-fields. "That wheat'll be ripe in a
 week. It sure looks fine.? Lenore, you ride back home
 now. Don't let Jake pump you. He's powerful curious. An'
 I'll go give these I.W.W.'s a first dose of Anderson."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He turned away without looking at her,
 and he hesitated, bending over to pluck a stem of
 goldenrod.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lass?you're?you're like
 your mother", he said, unsteadily. "An' she helped me win
 out durin' my struggle here. You're brave an' you're
 big."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore wanted to say something, to
 show her feeling, to make her task seem lighter, but she
 could not speak.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We're pards now?with no
 secrets", he continued, with a different note in his voice.
 "An' I want you to know that it ain't likely Nash or
 Glidden will get out of this country alive."</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Three days later, Lenore accompanied
 her father on the ride to the Bend country. She sat in the
 back seat of the car with Jake?an arrangement very
 gratifying to the cowboy, but received with ill-concealed
 displeasure by the driver, Nash. They had arranged to start
 at sunrise, and it became manifest that Nash had expected
 Lenore to sit beside him all during the long ride. It was
 her father, however, who took the front seat, and behind
 Nash's back he had slyly winked at Lenore, as if to
 compliment her on the evident success of their deep plot.
 Lenore, at the first opportunity that presented, shot Nash
 a warning glance which was sincere enough. Jake had begun
 to use keen eyes, and there was no telling what he might
 do.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The morning was cool, sweet, fresh,
 with a red sun presaging a hot day. The big car hummed like
 a droning bee and seemed to cover the miles as if by magic.
 Lenore sat with face uncovered, enjoying the breeze and the
 endless colorful scene flashing by, listening to Jake's
 amusing comments, and trying to keep back thought of what
 discovery might await her before the end of this day.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Once across the Copper River, they
 struck the gradual ascent, and here the temperature began
 to mount and the dust to fly. Lenore drew her veils close
 and, leaning comfortably back, she resigned herself to wait
 and to endure.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">By the flight of a crow it was about a
 hundred miles from Anderson's ranch to Palmer; but by the
 round-about roads necessary to take the distance was a
 great deal longer. Lenore was well aware when they got up
 on the desert, and the time came when she thought she would
 suffocate. There appeared to be intolerable hours in which
 no one spoke and only the hum and creak of the machine
 throbbed in her ears. She could not see through her veils
 and did not part them until a stop was made at Palmer.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Her father got out, sputtering and
 gasping, shaking the dust in clouds from his long linen
 coat. Jake, who always said he lived on dust and heat,
 averred it was not exactly a regular fine day. Lenore
 looked out, trying to get a breath of air. Nash busied
 himself with the hot engine.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The little country town appeared dead,
 and buried under dust. There was not a person in sight nor
 a sound to be heard. The sky resembled molten lead, with a
 blazing center too bright for the gaze of man.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson and Jake went into the little
 hotel to get some refreshments. Lenore preferred to stay in
 the car, saying she wanted only a cool drink. The moment
 the two men were out of sight Nash straightened up to gaze
 darkly and hungrily at Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"This's a good a chance as we'll get,"
 he said, in an eager, hurried whisper.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"For what?" asked Lenore, aghast.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"To run off," he replied, huskily.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore had proceeded so cleverly to
 carry out her scheme that in three days Nash had begun to
 implore and demand that she elope with him. He had been so
 much of a fool. But she as yet had found out but little
 about him. His right name was Ruenke. He was a socialist.
 He had plenty of money and hinted of mysterious sources for
 more.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At this Lenore hid her face, and while
 she fell back in pretended distress, she really wanted to
 laugh. She had learned something new in these few days, and
 that was to hate.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh no! no!" she murmured. "I?I
 can't think of that?yet."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But why not?" he demanded, in shrill
 violence. His gloved hand clenched on the tool he held.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mother has been so unhappy?with
 my brother Jim?off to the war. I?I just
 couldn't?now. Harry, you must give me time. It's all
 so?so sudden. Please wait!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash appeared divided between two
 emotions. Lenore watched him from behind her parted veil.
 She had been astonished to find out that, side by side with
 her intense disgust and shame at the part she was playing,
 there was a strong, keen, passionate interest in it, owing
 to the fact that, though she could prove little against
 this man, her woman's intuition had sensed his secret
 deadly antagonism toward her father. By little significant
 mannerisms and revelations he had more and more betrayed
 the German in him. She saw it in his overbearing conceit,
 his almost instant assumption that he was her master. At
 first Lenore feared him, but, as she learned to hate him
 she lost her fear. She had never been alone with him except
 under such circumstances as this; and she had decided she
 would not be.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wait?" he was expostulating. "But
 it's going to get hot for me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh!? What do you mean?" she
 begged. "You frighten me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lenore, the I.W.W. will have hard
 sledding in this wheat country. I belong to that. I told
 you. But the union is run differently this summer. And I've
 got work to do?that I don't like, since I fell in
 love with you. Come, run off with me and I'll give it
 up."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore trembled at this admission. She
 appeared to be close upon further discovery.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Harry, how wildly you talk!" she
 exclaimed. "I hardly know you. You frighten me with your
 mysterious talk.? Have?a?a little
 consideration for me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash strode back to lean into the car.
 Behind his huge goggles his eyes gleamed. His gloved hand
 closed hard on her arm.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It is sudden. It's got to be sudden,"
 he said, in fierce undertone. "You must trust me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I will. But you must confide in me,"
 she replied, earnestly. "I'm not quite a fool. You're
 rushing me?too?too?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly he released her, threw up his
 hand, then quickly stepped back to the front of the car.
 Jake stood in the door of the hotel. He had seen that
 action of Nash's. Then Anderson appeared, followed by a boy
 carrying a glass of water for Lenore. They approached the
 car, Jake sauntering last, with his curious gaze on
 Nash.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Go in an' get a bite an' a drink,"
 said Anderson to the driver. "An' hurry."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash obeyed. Jake's eyes never left
 him until he entered the door. Then Jake stepped in beside
 Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Thet water's wet, anyhow," he
 drawled.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We'll get a good cold drink at
 Dorn's," said Anderson. "Lass, how are you makin' it?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Fine," she replied, smiling.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So I seen," significantly added Jake,
 with a piercing glance at her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore realized then that she would
 have to confide in Jake or run the risk of having violence
 done to Nash. So she nodded wisely at the cowboy and winked
 mischievously, and, taking advantage of Anderson's entering
 the car, she whispered in Jake's ear: "I'm finding out
 things. Tell you?later."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The cowboy looked anything but
 convinced; and he glanced with narrowed eyes at Nash as
 that worthy hurried back to the car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With a lurch and a leap the car left
 Palmer behind in a cloud of dust. The air was furnace-hot,
 oppressive, and exceedingly dry. Lenore's lips smarted so
 that she continually moistened them. On all sides stretched
 dreary parched wheat-fields. Anderson shook his head sadly.
 Jake said: "Ain't thet too bad? Not half growed, an' sure
 too late now."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Near at hand Lenore saw the short
 immature dirty-whitish wheat, and she realized that it was
 ruined.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's been gettin' worse, Jake,"
 remarked Anderson. "Most of this won't be cut at all. An'
 what is cut won't yield seedlings. I see a yellow patch
 here an' there on the north slopes, but on the most part
 the Bend's a failure."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father, you remember Dorn's section,
 that promised so well?" asked Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes. But it promised only in case of
 rain. I look for the worst," replied Anderson,
 regretfully.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It looks like storm-clouds over
 there," said Lenore, pointing far ahead.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Through the drifting veils of heat,
 far across the bare, dreamy hills of fallow and the blasted
 fields of wheat, stood up some huge white columnar clouds,
 a vivid contrast to the coppery sky.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"By George! there's a thunderhead!"
 exclaimed Anderson. "Jake, what do you make of that?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Looks good to me," replied Jake, who
 was always hopeful.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore bore the hot wind and the fine,
 choking dust without covering her face. She wanted to see
 all the hills and valleys of this desert of wheat. Her
 heart beat a little faster as, looking across that waste on
 waste of heroic labor, she realized she was nearing the end
 of a ride that might be momentous for her. The very aspect
 of that wide, treeless expanse, with all its overwhelming
 meaning, seemed to make her a stronger and more thoughtful
 girl. If those endless wheat-fields were indeed ruined,
 what a pity, what a tragedy! Not only would young Dorn be
 ruined, but perhaps many other toiling farmers. Somehow
 Lenore felt no hopeless certainty of ruin for the young man
 in whom she was interested.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"There, on that slope!" spoke up
 Anderson, pointing to a field which was yellow in contrast
 to the surrounding gray field. "There's a half-section of
 fair wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But such tinges of harvest gold were
 not many in half a dozen miles of dreary hills. Where were
 the beautiful shadows in the wheat? wondered Lenore. Not a
 breath of wind appeared to stir across those fields.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">As the car neared the top of a hill
 the road curved into another, and Lenore saw a dusty flash
 of another car passing on ahead.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly Jake leaned forward.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boss, I seen somethin' throwed out of
 thet car?into the wheat," he said.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What??Mebbe it was a bottle,"
 replied Anderson, peering ahead.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nope. Sure wasn't thet.? There!
 I seen it again. Watch, boss!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore strained her eyes and felt a
 stir of her pulses. Jake's voice was perturbing. Was it
 strange that Nash slowed up a little where there was no
 apparent need? Then Lenore saw a hand flash out of the side
 of the car ahead and throw a small, glinting object into
 the wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"There! Seen it again," said Jake.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I saw!? Jake, mark that
 spot.? Nash, slow down," yelled Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore gathered from the look of her
 father and the cowboy that something was amiss, but she
 could not guess what it might be. Nash bent sullenly at his
 task of driving.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon about here," said Jake,
 waving his hand.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Stop her," ordered Anderson, and as
 the car came to a halt he got out, followed by Jake.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, I marked it by thet rock,"
 declared the cowboy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So did I," responded Anderson. "Let's
 get over the fence an' find what it was they threw in
 there."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jake rested a lean hand on a post and
 vaulted the fence. But Anderson had to climb laboriously
 and painfully over the barbed-wire obstruction. Lenore
 marveled at his silence and his persistence. Anderson hated
 wire fences. Presently he got over, and then he divided his
 time between searching in the wheat and peering after the
 strange car that was drawing far away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore saw Jake pick up something and
 scrutinize it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll be dog-goned!" he muttered. Then
 he approached Anderson. "What is thet?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, you can lambaste me if I ever
 saw the likes," replied Anderson. "But it looks bad. Let's
 rustle after that car."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">As Anderson clambered into his seat
 once more he looked dark and grim.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Catch that car ahead," he tersely
 ordered Nash. Whereupon the driver began to go through his
 usual motions in starting.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lenore, what do you make of this?"
 queried Anderson, turning to show her a small cake of some
 gray substance, soft and wet to the touch.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I don't know what it is," replied
 Lenore, wonderingly. "Do you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. An' I'd give a lot?Say,
 Nash, hurry! Overhaul that car!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson turned to see why his order
 had not been obeyed. He looked angry. Nash made hurried
 motions. The car trembled, the machinery began to
 whir?then came a tremendous buzzing roar, a violent
 shaking of the car, followed by sharp explosions, and
 silence.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You stripped the gears!" shouted
 Anderson, with the red fading out of his face.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No; but something's wrong," replied
 Nash. He got out to examine the engine.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson manifestly controlled strong
 feeling. Lenore saw Jake's hand go to her father's
 shoulder. "Boss," he whispered, "we can't ketch thet car
 now." Anderson resigned himself, averted his face so that
 he could not see Nash, who was tinkering with the engine.
 Lenore believed then that Nash had deliberately stalled the
 engine or disordered something, so as to permit the escape
 of the strange car ahead. She saw it turn off the long,
 straight road ahead and disappear to the right. After some
 minutes' delay Nash resumed his seat and started the car
 once more.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">From the top of the next hill Lenore
 saw the Dorn farm and home. All the wheat looked parched.
 She remembered, however, that the section of promising
 grain lay on the north slope, and therefore out of sight
 from where she was.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Looks as bad as any," said Anderson.
 "Good-by to my money."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore shut her eyes and thought of
 herself, her inward state. She seemed calm, and glad to
 have that first part of the journey almost ended. Her
 motive in coming was not now the impelling thing that had
 actuated her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When next the car slowed down she
 heard her father say, "Drive in by the house."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then Lenore, opening her eyes, saw the
 gate, the trim little orchard with its scant shade, the
 gray old weatherbeaten house which she remembered so well.
 The big porch looked inviting, as it was shady and held an
 old rocking-chair and a bench with blue cushions. A door
 stood wide open. No one appeared to be on the premises.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nash, blow your horn an' then hunt
 around for somebody," said Anderson. "Come, get out,
 Lenore. You must be half dead."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh no. Only half dust and half fire,"
 replied Lenore, laughing, as she stepped out. What a relief
 to get rid of coat, veils, bonnet, and to sit on a shady
 porch where a faint breeze blew! Just at that instant she
 heard a low, distant rumbling. Thunder! It thrilled her.
 Jake brought her a cold, refreshing drink, and she sent him
 back after another. She wet her handkerchief and bathed her
 hot face. It was indeed very comfortable there after that
 long hot ride.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Miss Lenore, I seen thet Nash pawin'
 you," said the cowboy, "an' by Gosh! I couldn't believe my
 eyes!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not so loud! Jake, the young
 gentleman imagines I'm in love with him," replied
 Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wall, I'll remove his imagining',"
 declared Jake, coolly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, you will do nothing."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Ahuh! Then you air in love with
 <i>him?</i>"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore was compelled to explain to
 this loyal cowboy just what the situation meant. Whereupon
 Jake swore his amaze, and said, "I'm a-goin' to lick him,
 anyhow, fer thet!" And he caught up the tin cup and
 shuffled away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Footsteps and voices sounded on the
 path, upon which presently appeared Anderson and young
 Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father's gone to Wheatly," he was
 saying. "But I'm glad to tell you we'll pay twenty thousand
 dollars on the debt as soon as we harvest. If it rains
 we'll pay it all and have thirty thousand left."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good! I sure hope it rains. An' that
 thunder sounds hopeful," responded Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's been hopeful like that for
 several days, but no rain," said Dorn. And then, espying
 Lenore, he seemed startled out of his eagerness. He flushed
 slightly. "I?I didn't see?you had brought your
 daughter."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He greeted her somewhat bashfully. And
 Lenore returned the greeting calmly, watching him steadily
 and waiting for the nameless sensations she had imagined
 would attend this meeting. But whatever these might be,
 they did not come to overwhelm her. The gladness of his
 voice, as he had spoken so eagerly to her father about the
 debt, had made her feel very kindly toward him. It might
 have been natural for a young man to resent this dragging
 debt. But he was fine. She observed, as he sat down, that,
 once the smile and flush left his face, he seemed somewhat
 thinner and older than she had pictured him. A shadow lay
 in his eyes and his lips were sad. He had evidently been
 working, upon their arrival. He wore overalls, dusty and
 ragged; his arms, bare to the elbow, were brown and
 muscular; his thin cotton shirt was wet with sweat and it
 clung to his powerful shoulders.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson surveyed the young man with
 friendly glance.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's your first name?" he queried,
 with his blunt frankness.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Kurt," was the reply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is that American?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. Neither is Dorn. But Kurt Dorn is
 an American."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hum! So I see, an' I'm powerful
 glad.? An' you've saved the big section of promisin'
 wheat?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes. We've been lucky. It's the best
 and finest wheat father ever raised. If it rains the yield
 will go sixty bushels to the acre."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sixty? Whew!" ejaculated
 Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore smiled at these wheat men, and
 said: "It surely will rain?and likely storm to-day. I
 am a prophet who never fails."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"By George! that's true! Lenore has
 anybody beat when it comes to figurin' the weather,"
 declared Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn looked at her without speaking,
 but his smile seemed to say that she could not help being a
 prophet of good, of hope, of joy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, Lenore, how many bushels in a
 section at sixty per acre?" went on Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Thirty-eight thousand four hundred,"
 replied Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"An' what'll you sell for?" asked
 Anderson of Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father has sold at two dollars and
 twenty-five cents a bushel," replied Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good! But he ought to have waited.
 The government will set a higher price.? How much
 will that come to, Lenore?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn's smile, as he watched Lenore do
 her mental arithmetic, attested to the fact that he already
 had figured out the sum.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Eighty-six thousand four hundred
 dollars," replied Lenore. "Is that right?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"An' you'll have thirty thousand
 dollars left after all debts are paid?" inquired
 Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, sir. I can hardly realize it.
 That's a fortune?for one section of wheat. But we've
 had four bad seasons.? Oh, if it only rains
 to-day!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore turned her cheek to the faint
 west wind. And then she looked long at the slowly spreading
 clouds, white and beautiful, high up near the sky-line, and
 dark and forbidding down along the horizon.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I knew a girl who could feel things
 move when no one else could," said Lenore. "I'm sensitive
 like that?at least about wind and rain. Right now I
 can feel rain in the air."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Then you have brought me luck," said
 Dorn, earnestly. "Indeed I guess my luck has turned. I
 hated the idea of going away with that debt unpaid."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Are you?going away?" asked
 Lenore, in surprise.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, rather," he replied, with a
 short, sardonic laugh. He fumbled in a pocket of his
 overalls and drew forth a paper which he opened. A flame
 burned the fairness from his face; his eyes darkened and
 shone with peculiar intensity of pride. "I was the first
 man drafted in this Bend country.? My number was the
 first called!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Drafted!" echoed Lenore, and she
 seemed to be standing on the threshold of an amazing and
 terrible truth.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lass, we forget," said her father,
 rather thickly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, but?why?" cried Lenore. She
 had voiced the same poignant appeal to her brother Jim. Why
 need he?why must he go to war? What for? And Jim had
 called out a bitter curse on the Germans he meant to
 kill.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why?" returned Dorn, with the sad,
 thoughtful shadow returning to his eyes. "How many times
 have I asked myself that?? In one way, I don't
 know.? I haven't told father yet!? It's not for
 his sake.? But when I think deeply?when I can
 feel and see?I mean I'm going for my country.?
 For you and your sisters."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Like a soldier then Lenore received
 her mortal blow facing him who dealt it, and it was a
 sudden overwhelming realization of love. No confusion, no
 embarrassment, no shame attended the agony of that
 revelation. Outwardly she did not seem to change at all.
 She felt her father's eyes upon her; but she had no wish to
 hide the tumult of her heart. The moment made her a woman.
 Where was the fulfilment of those vague, stingingly sweet
 dreamy fancies of love? Where was her maiden reserve, that
 she so boldly recognized an unsolicited passion? Her eyes
 met Dorn's steadily, and she felt some vital and compelling
 spirit pass from her to him. She saw him struggle with what
 he could not understand. It was his glance that wavered and
 fell, his hand that trembled, his breast that heaved. She
 loved him. There had been no beginning. Always he had lived
 in her dreams. And like her brother he was going to kill
 and to be killed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then Lenore gazed away across the
 wheat-fields. The shadows came waving toward her. A
 stronger breeze fanned her cheeks. The heavens were
 darkening and low thunder rolled along the battlements of
 the great clouds.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, Kurt, what do you make of this?"
 asked Anderson. Lenore, turning, saw her father hold out
 the little gray cake that Jake had found in the
 wheat-field.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Young Dorn seized it quickly, felt and
 smelled and bit it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Where'd you get this?" he asked, with
 excitement.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson related the circumstance of
 its discovery.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's a preparation, mostly
 phosphorus," replied Dorn. "When the moisture evaporates it
 will ignite?set fire to any dry substance.?
 That is a trick of the I.W.W. to burn the
 wheat-fields."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"By all that's ??!" swore
 Anderson, with his jaw bulging. "Jake an' I knew it meant
 bad. But we didn't know what."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I've been expecting tricks of all
 kinds," said Dorn. "I have four men watching the
 section."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Good! Say, that car turned off to the
 right back here some miles.? But, worse luck, the
 I.W.W.'s can work at night."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We'll watch at night, too," replied
 Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore was conscious of anger
 encroaching upon the melancholy splendor of her emotions,
 and the change was bitter.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"When the rain comes, won't it
 counteract the ignition of that phosphorus?" she asked,
 eagerly, for she knew that rain would come.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Only for the time being. It 'll be
 just as dry this time to-morrow as it is now."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Then the wheat's goin' to burn,"
 declared Anderson, grimly. "If that trick has been worked
 all over this country you're goin' to have worse 'n a
 prairie fire. The job on hand is to save this one section
 that has a fortune tied up in it."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Anderson, that job looks almost
 hopeless, in the light of this phosphorus trick. What on
 earth can be done? I've four men. I can't hire any more,
 because I can't trust these strangers. And how can four
 men?or five, counting me, watch a square mile of
 wheat day and night?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The situation looked hopeless to
 Lenore and she was sick. What cruel fates toyed with this
 young farmer! He seemed to be sinking under this last
 crowning blow. There in the sky, rolling up and rumbling,
 was the long-deferred rain-storm that meant freedom from
 debt, and a fortune besides. But of what avail the rain if
 it was to rush the wheat to full bursting measure only for
 the infernal touch of the foreigner?</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson, however, was no longer a
 boy. He had dealt with many and many a trial. Never was he
 plunged into despair until after the dread crisis had come
 to pass. His red forehead, frowning and ridged with
 swelling blood-vessels, showed the bent of his mind.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, it is hard!" said Lenore to Dorn.
 "I'm so sorry! But don't give up. While there's life
 there's hope!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He looked up with tears in his
 eyes.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Thank you.? I did weaken. You
 see I've let myself believe too much?for dad's sake.
 I don't care about the money for myself.? Money! What
 good will money be to me?now? It's over for
 me.? To get the wheat
 cut?harvested?that's all I hoped.? The
 army?war?France?I go to be?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hush!" whispered Lenore, and she put
 a soft hand upon his lips, checking the end of that bitter
 speech. She felt him start, and the look she met pierced
 her soul. "Hush!? It's going to rain!? Father
 will find some way to save the wheat!? And you are
 coming home?after the war!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He crushed her hand to his hot
 lips.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You make me?ashamed. I won't
 give?up," he said, brokenly. "And when I'm
 over?there?in the trenches, I'll
 think?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dorn, listen to this," rang out
 Anderson. "We'll fool that I.W.W. gang.?It's a-goin'
 to rain. So far so good. To-morrow you take this cake of
 phosphorus an' ride around all over the country. Show it
 an' tell the farmers their wheat's goin' to burn. An' offer
 them whose fields are already ruined?that fire can't
 do no more harm?offer them big money to help you save
 your section. Half a hundred men could put out a fire if
 one did start. An' these neighbors of yours, some of them
 will jump at a chance to beat the I.W.W.? Boy, it can
 be done!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He ended with a big fist held aloft in
 triumph.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"See! Didn't I tell you?" murmured
 Lenore, softly. It touched her deeply to see Dorn respond
 to hope. His haggard face suddenly warmed and glowed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I never thought of that," he burst
 out, radiantly. "We can save the wheat.? Mr.
 Anderson, I?I can't thank you enough."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Don't try," replied the rancher.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I tell you it will rain," cried
 Lenore, gaily. "Let's walk out there?watch the storm
 come across the hills. I love to see the shadows blow over
 the wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore became aware, as she passed the
 car, that Nash was glaring at her in no unmistakable
 manner. She had forgotten all about him. The sight of his
 jealous face somehow added to her strange exhilaration.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">They crossed the road from the house,
 and, facing the west, had free prospect of the miles of
 billowy hills and the magnificent ordnance of the
 storm-clouds. The deep, low mutterings of thunder seemed a
 grand and welcome music. Lenore stole a look at Dorn, to
 see him, bareheaded, face upturned, entranced. It was only
 a rain-storm coming! Down in the valley country such storms
 were frequent at this season, too common for their meaning
 to be appreciated. Here in the desert of wheat rain was a
 blessing, life itself.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The creamy-white, rounded edge of the
 approaching clouds came and coalesced, spread and
 mushroomed. Under them the body of the storm was purple,
 lit now and then by a flash of lightning. Long, drifting
 veils of rain, gray as thin fog, hung suspended between sky
 and earth.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Listen!" exclaimed Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A warm wind, laden with dry scent of
 wheat, struck Lenore's face and waved her hair. It brought
 a silken, sweeping rustle, a whispering of the bearded
 grain. The soft sound thrilled Lenore. It seemed a sweet,
 hopeful message that waiting had been rewarded, that the
 drought could be broken. Again, and more beautiful than
 ever before in her life, she saw the waves of shadow as
 they came forward over the wheat. Rippling, like breezes
 over the surface of a golden lake, they came in long,
 broken lines, moving, following, changing, until the whole
 wheat-field seemed in shadowy motion.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The cloud pageant rolled on above and
 beyond. Lenore felt a sweet drop of rain splash upon her
 upturned face. It seemed like a caress. There came a
 pattering around her. Suddenly rose a damp, faint smell of
 dust. Beyond the hill showed a gray pall of rain, coming
 slowly, charged with a low roar. The whisper of the
 sweeping wheat was swallowed up.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore stood her ground until heavy
 rain drops fell thick and fast upon her, sinking through
 her thin waist to thrill her flesh; and then, with a last
 gay call to those two man lovers of wheat and storms, she
 ran for the porch.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There they joined her, Anderson
 puffing and smiling, Dorn still with that rapt look upon
 his face. The rain swept up and roared on the roof, while
 all around was streaked gray.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, there's your
 thirty-thousand-dollar rain!" shouted Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But Dorn did not hear. Once he smiled
 at Lenore as if she were the good fairy who had brought
 about this miracle. In his look Lenore had deeper
 realization of him, of nature, and of life. She loved rain,
 but always, thenceforth, she would reverence it. Fresh,
 cool fragrance of a renewed soil filled the air. All that
 dusty gray hue of the earth had vanished, and it was wet
 and green and bright. Even as she gazed the water seemed to
 sink in as it fell, a precious relief to thirsty soil. The
 thunder rolled away eastward and the storm passed. The thin
 clouds following soon cleared away from the western sky,
 rain-washed and blue, with a rainbow curving down to bury
 its exquisite hues in the golden wheat.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The journey homeward held many
 incalculable differences from the uncertain doubts and
 fears that had tormented Lenore on the outward trip.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">For a long time she felt the warm,
 tight clasp of Dorn's hand on hers as he had said good-by.
 Very evidently he believed that was to be his last sight of
 her. Lenore would never forget the gaze that seemed to try
 to burn her image on his memory forever. She felt that they
 would meet again. Solemn thoughts revolved in her mind;
 still, she was not unhappy. She had given much unsought,
 but the return to her seemed growing every moment that she
 lived.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The dust had been settled by the rain
 for many miles; however, beyond Palmer there began to show
 evidences that the storm had thinned out or sheered off,
 because the road gradually grew dry again. When dust rose
 once more Lenore covered her face, although, obsessed as
 she was by the deep change in herself, neither dust nor
 heat nor distance affected her greatly. Like the miles the
 moments sped by. She was aware through closed eyes when
 darkness fell. Stops were frequent after the Copper River
 had been crossed, and her father appeared to meet and
 question many persons in the towns they passed. Most of his
 questioning pertained to the I.W.W. And even excited
 whispering by her father and Jake had no power to interest
 her. It was midnight when they reached "Many Waters" and
 Lenore became conscious of fatigue.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash crowded in front of Jake as she
 was about to step out, and assisted her. He gave her arm a
 hard squeeze and fiercely whispered in her ear,
 "To-morrow!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The whisper was trenchant with meaning
 and thoroughly aroused Lenore. But she gave no sign and
 moved away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I seen strangers sneakin' off in the
 dark," Jake was whispering to Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Keep your eyes peeled," replied
 Anderson. "I'll take Lenore up to the house an' come
 back."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was pitch black up the path through
 the grove and Lenore had to cling to her father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is there?any danger?" she
 whispered.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We're lookin' for anythin'," replied
 Anderson, slowly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Will you be careful?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure, lass. I'll take no foolish
 risks. I've got men watchin' the house an' ranch. But I'd
 better have the cowboys down. There's Jake?he spots
 some prowlin' coyotes the minute we reach home."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson unlocked and opened the door.
 The hall was dark and quiet. He turned on the electric
 light. Lenore was detaching her veil.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You look pale," he said,
 solicitously. "No wonder. That was a ride. But I'm glad we
 went. I saved Dorn's wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm glad, too, father.
 Good-night!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He bade her good-night, and went out,
 locking the door. Then his rapid footsteps died away.
 Wearily Lenore climbed the stairs and went to her room.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She was awakened from deep slumber by
 Kathleen, who pulled and tugged at her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lenorry, I thought you was dead, your
 eyes were shut so tight," declared the child. "Breakfast is
 waiting. Did you fetch me anything?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, a new sister," replied Lenore,
 dreamily.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kathleen's eyes opened wide.
 "Where?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore place a hand over her
 heart.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Here."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, you do look funny.? Get up,
 Lenorry. Did you hear the shooting last night?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Instantly Lenore sat up and
 stared.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. Was there any?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You bet. But I don't know what it was
 all about."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore dispelled her dreamy state,
 and, hurriedly dressing, she went down to breakfast. Her
 father and Rose were still at the table.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hello, big eyes!" was his
 greeting.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">And Rose, not to be outdone, chirped,
 "Hello, old sleepy-head!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore's reply lacked her usual
 spontaneity. And she felt, if she did not explain, the
 wideness of her eyes. Her father did not look as if
 anything worried him. It was a way of his, however, not to
 show stress or worry. Lenore ate in silence until Rose left
 the dining-room, and then she asked her father if there had
 been shooting.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure," he replied, with a broad
 smile. "Jake turned his guns loose on them prowlin' men
 last night. By George! you ought to have heard them run.
 One plumped into the gate an' went clear over it, to fall
 like a log. Another fell into the brook an' made more
 racket than a drownin' horse. But it was so dark we
 couldn't catch them."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake shot to frighten them?" inquired
 Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not much. He stung one I.W.W., that's
 sure. We heard a cry, an' this mornin' we found some
 blood."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What do you suppose these?these
 night visitors wanted?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No tellin'. Jake thinks one of them
 looked an' walked like the man Nash has been meetin'.
 Anyway, we're not takin' much more chance on Nash. I reckon
 it's dangerous keepin' him around. I'll have him drive me
 to-day?over to Vale, an' then to Huntington. You can
 go along. That'll be your last chance to pump him. Have you
 found out anythin'?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore told what had transpired
 between her and the driver. Anderson's face turned fiery
 red.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That ain't much to help us,"
 declared, angrily. "But it shows him up.? So his real
 name's Ruenke? Fine American name, I don't think! That
 man's a spy an' a plotter. An' before he's another day
 older I'm goin' to corner him. It's a sure go I can't hold
 Jake in any longer."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">To Lenore it was a further indication
 of her father's temper that when they went down to enter
 the car he addressed Nash in cool, careless, easy speech.
 It made Lenore shiver. She had heard stories of her
 father's early career among hard men.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jake was there, dry, caustic, with
 keen, quiet eyes that any subtle, clever man would have
 feared. But Nash's thought seemed turned mostly inward.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore took the front seat in the car
 beside the driver. He showed unconscious response to that
 action.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jake, aren't you coming?" she asked,
 of the cowboy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, I reckon it'll be sure dull fer
 you without me. Nobody to talk to while your dad fools
 around. But I can't go. Me an' the boys air a-goin' to hang
 some I.W.W.'s this mawnin', an' I can't miss thet fun."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jake drawled his speech and laughed
 lazily as he ended it. He was just boasting, as usual, but
 his hawklike eyes were on Nash. And it was certain that
 Nash turned pale.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore had no reply to make. Her
 father appeared to lose patience with Jake, but after a
 moment's hesitation decided not to voice it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash was not a good nor a careful
 driver under any circumstances, and this morning it was
 evident he did not have his mind on his business. There
 were bumps in the orchard road where the irrigation ditches
 crossed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, you ought to be drivin' a
 hay-wagon," called Anderson, sarcastically.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At Vale he ordered the car stopped at
 the post-office, and, telling Lenore he might be detained a
 few moments, he went in. Nash followed, and presently came
 back with a package of letters. Upon taking his seat in the
 car he assorted the letters, one of which, a large, thick
 envelope, manifestly gave him excited gratification. He
 pocketed them and turned to Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Ah! I see you get letters?from
 a woman," she said, pretending a poison sweetness of
 jealousy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Certainly. I'm not married yet," he
 replied. "Lenore, last night?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You will never be married?to
 me?while you write to other women. Let me see that
 letter!? Let me read it?all of them!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, Lenore?not here. And don't
 speak so loud. Your father will be coming any
 minute.? Lenore, he suspects me. And that cowboy
 knows things. I can't go back to the ranch."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, you must come!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. If you love me you've got to run
 off with me to-day."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But why the hurry?" she appealed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's getting hot for me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What do you mean by that? Why don't
 you explain to me? As long as you are so strange, so
 mysterious, how can I trust you? You ask me to run off with
 you, yet you don't put confidence in me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash grew pale and earnest, and his
 hands shook.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But if I do confide in you, then will
 you come with me?" he queried, breathlessly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll not promise. Maybe what you have
 to tell will prove?you?you don't care for
 me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It 'll prove I do," he replied,
 passionately.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Then tell me." Lenore realized she
 could no longer play the part she had assumed. But Nash was
 so stirred by his own emotions, so carried along in a
 current, that he did not see the difference in her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Listen. I tell you it's getting hot
 for me," he whispered. "I've been put here?close to
 Anderson?to find out things and to carry out orders.
 Lately I've neglected my job because I fell in love with
 you. He's your father. If I go on with plans?and harm
 comes to him?I'll never get you. Is that clear?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It certainly is," replied Lenore, and
 she felt a tightness at her throat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm no member of the I.W.W.," he went
 on. "Whatever that organization might have been last year,
 it's gone wild this year.? There are interests that
 have used the I.W.W. I'm only an agent, and I'm not high
 up, either. I see what the government will do to the I.W.W.
 if the Northwest leaves any of it. But just now there're
 plots against a few big men like your father. He's to be
 ruined. His crops and ranches destroyed. And he's to be
 killed. It's because he's so well known and has so much
 influence that he was marked. I told you the I.W.W. was
 being used to make trouble. They are being stirred up by
 agitators, bribed and driven, all for the purpose of making
 a great disorder in the Northwest."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Germany!" whispered Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I can't say. But men are all over,
 and these men work in secret. There are American citizens
 in the Northwest?one right in this valley?who
 have plotted to ruin your father."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Do you know who they are?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, I do not."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You are for Germany, of course?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I have been. My people are German.
 But I was born in the U.S. And if it suits me I will be for
 America. If you come with me I'll throw up this dirty job,
 advise Glidden to shift the plot from your father to some
 other man?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So it's Glidden!" exclaimed
 Lenore.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash bit his lip, and for the first
 time looked at Lenore without thinking of himself. And
 surprise dawned in his eyes.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, Glidden. You saw him speak to me
 up in the Bend, the first time your father went to see
 Dorn's wheat. Glidden's playing the I.W.W. against itself.
 He means to drop out of this deal with big money.?Now
 I'll save your father if you'll stick to me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore could no longer restrain
 herself. This man was not even big in his wickedness.
 Lenore divined that his later words held no truth.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Ruenke, you are a detestable
 coward," she said, with quivering scorn. "I let you
 imagine?Oh! I can't speak it!?
 You?you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"God! You fooled me!" he ejaculated,
 his jaw falling in utter amaze.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You were contemptibly easy. You'd
 better jump out of this car and run. My father will shoot
 you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You deceitful?cat!" he cried,
 haltingly, as anger overcame his astonishment.
 "I'll?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson's big bulk loomed up behind
 Nash. Lenore gasped as she saw her father, for his eyes
 were upon her and he had recognized events.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, Mister Ruenke, the postmaster
 says you get letters here under different names," said
 Anderson, bluntly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes?I?I?get
 them?for a friend," stammered the driver, as his face
 turned white.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You lyin' German pup!? I'll
 look over them letters!" Anderson's big hand shot out to
 clutch Nash, holding him powerless, and with the other hand
 he searched Nash's inside coat pockets, to tear forth a
 packet of letters. Then Anderson released him and stepped
 back. "Get out of that car!" he thundered.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash made a slow movement, as if to
 comply, then suddenly he threw on the power. The car jerked
 forward.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson leaped to get one hand on the
 car door, the other on Nash. He almost pulled the driver
 out of his seat. But Nash held on desperately, and the car,
 gaining momentum, dragged Anderson. He could not get his
 feet up on the running-board, and suddenly he fell.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore screamed and tore frantically
 at the handle of the door. Nash struck her, jerked her back
 into the seat. She struggled until the car shot full speed
 ahead. Then it meant death for her to leap out.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sit still, or you'll kill yourself."
 shouted Nash, hoarsely.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Lenore fell back, almost fainting,
 with the swift realization of what had happened.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt Dorn had indeed no hope of ever
 seeing Lenore Anderson again, and he suffered a pang that
 seemed to leave his heart numb, though Anderson's timely
 visit might turn out as providential as the saving
 rain-storm. The wheat waved and rustled as if with renewed
 and bursting life. The exquisite rainbow still shone, a
 beautiful promise, in the sky. But Dorn could not be happy
 in that moment.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This day Lenore Anderson had seemed a
 bewildering fulfilment of the sweetness he had imagined was
 latent in her. She had meant what was beyond him to
 understand. She had gently put a hand to his lips, to check
 the bitter words, and he had dared to kiss her soft
 fingers. The thrill, the sweetness, the incomprehensible
 and perhaps imagined response of her pulse would never
 leave him. He watched the big car until it was out of
 sight.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The afternoon was only half advanced
 and there were numberless tasks to do. He decided he could
 think and plan while he worked. As he was about to turn
 away he espied another automobile, this one coming from the
 opposite direction to that Anderson had taken. The sight of
 it reminded Dorn of the I.W.W. trick of throwing phosphorus
 cakes into the wheat. He was suspicious of that car. It
 slowed down in front of the Dorn homestead, turned into the
 yard, and stopped near where Dorn stood. The dust had caked
 in layers upon it. Someone hailed him and asked if this was
 the Dorn farm. Kurt answered in the affirmative, whereupon
 a tall man, wearing a long linen coat, opened the car door
 to step out. In the car remained the driver and another
 man.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My name is Hall," announced the
 stranger, with a pleasant manner. "I'm from Washington,
 D.C. I represent the government and am in the Northwest in
 the interest of the Conservation Commission. Your name has
 been recommended to me as one of the progressive young
 wheat-growers of the Bend; particularly that you are an
 American, located in a country exceedingly important to the
 United States just now?a country where foreign-born
 people predominate."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt, somewhat startled and awed,
 managed to give a courteous greeting to his visitor, and
 asked him into the house. But Mr. Hall preferred to sit
 outdoors on the porch. He threw off hat and coat, and,
 taking an easy chair, he produced some cigars.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Will you smoke?" he asked, offering
 one.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt declined with thanks. He was
 aware of this man's penetrating, yet kindly scrutiny of
 him, and he had begun to wonder. This was no ordinary
 visitor.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Have you been drafted?" abruptly
 queried Mr. Hall.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, sir. Mine was the first number,"
 replied Kurt, with a little pride.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Do you want exemption?" swiftly came
 the second query.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It shocked Dorn, then stung him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No," he said, forcibly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Your father's sympathy is with
 Germany, I understand."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, sir, I don't know how you
 understand that, but it's true?to my regret and
 shame."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You want to fight?" went on the
 official.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I hate the idea of war. But I?I
 guess I want to fight. Maybe that's because I'm feeling
 scrappy over these I.W.W. tricks."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dorn, the I.W.W. is only one of the
 many phases of war that we must meet," returned Mr. Hall,
 and then for a moment he thoughtfully drew upon his
 cigar.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Young man, I like your talk. And I'll
 tell you a secret. My name's not Hall. Never mind my name.
 For you it's Uncle Sam!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Whereupon, with a winning and
 fascinating manner that seemed to Kurt at once intimate and
 flattering, he began to talk fluently of the meaning of his
 visit, and of its cardinal importance. The government was
 looking far ahead, preparing for a tremendous, and perhaps
 a lengthy, war. The food of the country must be conserved.
 Wheat was one of the most vital things in the whole world,
 and the wheat of America was incalculably
 precious?only the government knew how precious. If
 the war was short a wheat famine would come afterward; if
 it was long, the famine would come before the war ended.
 But it was inevitable. The very outcome of the war itself
 depended upon wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The government expected a nation-wide
 propaganda by the German interests which would be carried
 on secretly and boldly, in every conceivable way, to
 alienate the labor organizations, to bribe or menace the
 harvesters, to despoil crops, and particularly to put
 obstacles in the way of the raising and harvesting, the
 transporting and storing of wheat. It would take an army to
 protect the nation's grain.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Dorn was earnestly besought by this
 official to compass his district, to find out who could be
 depended upon by the United States and who was
 antagonistic, to impress upon the minds of all his
 neighbors the exceeding need of greater and more persistent
 cultivation of wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I accept. I'll do my best," replied
 Kurt, grimly. "I'll be going some the next two weeks."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's deplorable that most of the
 wheat in this section is a failure," said the official.
 "But we must make up for that next year. I see you have one
 magnificent wheat-field. But, fact is, I heard of that long
 before I got here."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes? Where?" ejaculated Kurt, quick
 to catch a significance in the other's words.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I've motored direct from Wheatly. And
 I'm sorry to say that what I have now to tell you is not
 pleasant.? Your father sold this wheat for eighty
 thousand dollars in cash. The money was seen to be paid
 over by a mill-operator of Spokane.? And your father
 is reported to be suspiciously interested in the I.W.W. men
 now at Wheatly."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, that's awful!" exclaimed Kurt,
 with a groan. "How did you learn that?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"From American farmers?men that
 I had been instructed to approach, the same as in your
 case. The information came quite by accident, however, and
 through my inquiring about the I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father has not been rational since
 the President declared war. He's very old. I've had trouble
 with him. He might do anything."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My boy, there are multitudes of
 irrational men nowadays and the number is growing.? I
 advise you to go at once to Wheatly and bring your father
 home. It was openly said that he was taking risks with that
 large sum of money."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Risks! Why, I can't understand that.
 The wheat's not harvested yet, let alone hauled to town.
 And to-day I learned the I.W.W. are working a trick with
 cakes of phosphorus, to burn the wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt produced the cake of phosphorus
 and explained its significance to the curious official.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Cunning devils! Who but a German
 would ever have thought of that?" he exclaimed. "German
 science! To such ends the Germans put their supreme
 knowledge!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I wonder what my father will say
 about this phosphorus trick. I just wonder. He loves the
 wheat. His wheat has taken prizes at three world's fairs.
 Maybe to see our wheat burn would untwist that twist in his
 brain and make him American."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I doubt it. Only death changes the
 state of a real German, physical, moral, and spiritual.
 Come, ride back to Glencoe with me. I'll drop you there.
 You can hire a car and make Wheatly before dark."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt ran indoors, thinking hard as he
 changed clothes. He told the housekeeper to tell Jerry he
 was called away and would be back next day. Putting money
 and a revolver in his pocket, he started out, but hesitated
 and halted. He happened to think that he was a poor shot
 with a revolver and a fine one with a rifle. So he went
 back for his rifle, a small high-power, repeating gun that
 he could take apart and hide under his coat. When he
 reached the porch the official glanced from the weapon to
 Kurt's face and said, with a flash of spirit:</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It appears that you are in
 earnest!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I am. Something told me to take
 this," responded Kurt, as he dismounted the rifle. "I've
 already had one run-in with an I.W.W. I know tough
 customers when I see them. These foreigners are the kind I
 don't want near me. And if I see one trying to fire the
 wheat I'll shoot his leg off."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm inclined to think that Uncle Sam
 would not deplore your shooting a little higher.?
 Dorn, you're fine! You're all I heard you were! Shake
 hands!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt tingled all over as he followed
 the official out to the car and took the seat given him
 beside the driver. "Back to Glencoe," was the order. And
 then, even if conversation had been in order, it would
 scarcely have been possible. That driver could drive! He
 had no fear and he knew his car. Kurt could drive himself,
 but he thought that if he had been as good as this fellow
 he would have chosen one of two magnificent services for
 the army?an ambulance-driver at the front or an
 aeroplane scout.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">On the way to Glencoe several squads
 of idling and marching men were passed, all of whom bore
 the earmarks of the I.W.W. Sight of them made Kurt hug his
 gun and wonder at himself. Never had he been a coward, but
 neither had he been one to seek a fight. This suave,
 distinguished government official, by his own significant
 metaphor, Uncle Sam gone abroad to find true hearts, had
 wrought powerfully upon Kurt's temper. He sensed events. He
 revolved in mind the need for him to be cool and decisive
 when facing the circumstances that were sure to arise.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At Glencoe, which was reached so
 speedily that Kurt could scarcely credit his eyes, the
 official said; "You'll hear from me. Good-by and good
 luck!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt hired a young man he knew to
 drive him over to Wheatly. All the way Kurt brooded about
 his father's strange action. The old man had left home
 before the rain-storm. How did he know he could guarantee
 so many bushels of wheat as the selling-price indicated?
 Kurt divined that his father had acted upon one of his
 strange weather prophecies. For he must have been
 absolutely sure of rain to save the wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Darkness had settled down when Kurt
 reached Wheatly and left the car at the railroad station.
 Wheatly was a fairly good-sized little town. There seemed
 to be an unusual number of men on the dark streets. Dim
 lights showed here and there. Kurt passed several times
 near groups of conversing men, but he did not hear any
 significant talk.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Most of the stores were open and well
 filled with men, but to Kurt's sharp eyes there appeared to
 be much more gossip going on than business. The town was
 not as slow and quiet as was usual with Bend towns. He
 listened for war talk, and heard none. Two out of every
 three men who spoke in his hearing did not use the English
 language. Kurt went into the office of the first hotel he
 found. There was no one present. He glanced at an old
 register lying on the desk. No guests had registered for
 several days.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then Kurt went out and accosted a man
 leaning against a hitching-rail.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's going on in this town?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The man stood rather indistinctly in
 the uncertain light. Kurt, however, made out his eyes and
 they were regarding him suspiciously.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nothin' onusual," was the reply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Has harvesting begun in these
 parts?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Some barley cut, but no wheat. Next
 week, I reckon."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"How's the wheat?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Some bad an' some good."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is this town a headquarters for the
 I.W.W.?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. But there's a big camp of
 I.W.W.'s near here. Reckon you're one of them union
 fellers?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I am not," declared Kurt,
 bluntly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Reckon you sure look like one, with
 thet gun under your coat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Are you going to hire I.W.W. men?"
 asked Kurt, ignoring the other's observation.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm only a farm-hand," was the sullen
 reply. "An' I tell you I won't join no I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt spared himself a moment to give
 this fellow a few strong proofs of the fact that any
 farm-hand was wise to take such a stand against the labor
 organization. Leaving the fellow gaping and staring after
 him, Kurt crossed the street to enter another hotel. It was
 more pretentious than the first, with a large, well lighted
 office. There were loungers at the tables. Kurt walked to
 the desk. A man leaned upon his elbows. He asked Kurt if he
 wanted a room. This man, evidently the proprietor, was a
 German, though he spoke English.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm not sure," replied Kurt. "Will
 you let me look at the register?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The man shoved the book around. Kurt
 did not find the name he sought.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My father, Chris Dorn, is in town.
 Can you tell me where I'll find him?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So you're young Dorn," replied the
 other, with instant change to friendliness. "I've heard of
 you. Yes, the old man is here. He made a big wheat deal
 to-day. He's eating his supper."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt stepped to the door indicated,
 and, looking into the dining-room, he at once espied his
 father's huge head with its shock of gray hair. He appeared
 to be in earnest colloquy with a man whose bulk matched his
 own. Kurt hesitated, and finally went back to the desk.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Who's the big man with my father?" he
 asked.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He is a big man, both ways. Don't you
 know him?" rejoined the proprietor, in a lower voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm not sure," answered Kurt. The
 lowered tone had a significance that decided Kurt to admit
 nothing.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's Neuman from Ruxton, one of the
 biggest wheat men in Washington."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt repressed a whistle of surprise.
 Neuman was Anderson's only rival in the great, fertile
 valley. What were Neuman and Chris Dorn doing with their
 heads together?</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I thought he was Neuman," replied
 Kurt, feeling his way. "Is he in on the big deal with
 father?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Which one?" queried the proprietor,
 with shrewd eyes, taking Kurt's measure. "You're in on
 both, of course."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure. I mean the wheat sale, not the
 I.W.W. deal," replied Kurt. He hazarded a guess with that
 mention of the I.W.W. No sooner had the words passed his
 lips than he divined he was on the track of sinister
 events.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Your father sold out to that Spokane
 miller. No, Neuman is not in on that."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I was surprised to hear father had
 sold the wheat. Was it speculation or guarantee?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Old Chris guaranteed sixty bushels.
 There were friends of his here who advised against it. Did
 you have rain over there?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Fine. The wheat will go over sixty
 bushels. I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"When it rained you hurried over to
 boost the price. Well, it's too late."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Is Glidden here?" queried Kurt,
 hazarding another guess.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Don't talk so loud," warned the
 proprietor. "Yes, he just got here in a car with two other
 men. He's up-stairs having supper in his room."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Supper!" Kurt echoed the word, and
 averted his face to hide the leap of his blood. "That
 reminds me, I'm hungry."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He went into the big, dimly lighted
 dining-room. There was a shelf on one side as he went in,
 and here, with his back turned to the room, he laid the
 disjointed gun and his hat. Several newspapers lying near
 attracted his eye. Quickly he slipped them under and around
 the gun, and then took a seat at the nearest table. A buxom
 German waitress came for his order. He gave it while he
 gazed around at his grim-faced old father and the burly
 Neuman, and his ears throbbed to the beat of his blood. His
 hand trembled on the table. His thoughts flashed almost too
 swiftly for comprehension. It took a stern effort to gain
 self-control.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Evil of some nature was afoot.
 Neuman's presence there was a strange, disturbing fact.
 Kurt had made two guesses, both alarmingly correct. If he
 had any more illusions or hopes, he dispelled them. His
 father had been won over by this arch conspirator of the
 I.W.W. And, despite his father's close-fistedness where
 money was concerned, that eighty thousand dollars, or part
 of it, was in danger.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt wondered how he could get
 possession of it. If he could he would return it to the
 bank and wire a warning to the Spokane buyer that the wheat
 was not safe. He might persuade his father to turn over the
 amount of the debt to Anderson. While thinking and
 planning, Kurt kept an eye on his father and rather
 neglected his supper. Presently, when old Dorn and Neuman
 rose and left the dining-room, Kurt followed them. His
 father was whispering to the proprietor over the desk, and
 at Kurt's touch he glared his astonishment.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You here! What for?" he demanded,
 gruffly, in German.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I had to see you," replied Kurt, in
 English.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Did it rain?" was the old man's
 second demand, husky and serious.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The wheat is made, if we can harvest
 it," answered Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The blaze of joy on old Dorn's face
 gave Kurt a twinge of pain. He hated to dispel it. "Come
 aside, here, a minute," he whispered, and drew his father
 over to a corner under a lamp. "I've got bad news. Look at
 this!" He produced the cake of phosphorus, careful to hide
 it from other curious eyes there, and with swift, low words
 he explained its meaning. He expected an outburst of
 surprise and fury, but he was mistaken.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I know about that," whispered his
 father, hoarsely. "There won't be any thrown in my
 wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father! What assurance have you of
 that?" queried Kurt, astounded.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The old man nodded his gray head
 wisely. He knew, but he did not speak.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Do you think these I.W.W. plotters
 will spare your wheat?" asked Kurt. "You are wrong. They
 may lie to your face. But they'll betray you. The I.W.W. is
 backed by?by interests that want to embarrass the
 government."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What government?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, ours?the U.S.
 government!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's not my government. The more
 it's embarrassed the better it will suit me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">In the stress of the moment Kurt had
 forgotten his father's bitter and unchangeable hatred.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But you're?you're stupid," he
 hissed, passionately. "That government has protected you
 for fifty years."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Old Dorn growled into his beard. His
 huge ox-eyes rolled. Kurt realized then finally how
 implacable and hopeless he was?how utterly German.
 Then Kurt importuned him to return the eighty thousand
 dollars to the bank until he was sure the wheat was
 harvested and hauled to the railroad.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My wheat won't burn," was old Dorn's
 stubborn reply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, then, give me Anderson's thirty
 thousand. I'll take it to him at once. Our debt will be
 paid. We'll have it off our minds."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No hurry about that," replied his
 father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But there is hurry," returned Kurt,
 in a hot whisper. "Anderson came to see you to-day. He
 wants his money."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Neuman holds the small end of that
 debt. I'll pay him. Anderson can wait."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt felt no amaze. He expected
 anything. But he could scarcely contain his fury. How this
 old man, his father, whom he had loved?how he had
 responded to the influences that must destroy him!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Anderson shall not wait," declared
 Kurt. "I've got some say in this matter. I've worked like a
 dog in those wheat-fields. I've a right to demand
 Anderson's money. He needs it. He has a tremendous harvest
 on his hands."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Old Dorn shook his huge head in somber
 and gloomy thought. His broad face, his deep eyes, seemed
 to mask and to hide. It was an expression Kurt had seldom
 seen there, but had always hated. It seemed so old to Kurt,
 that alien look, something not born of his time.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Anderson is a capitalist," said Chris
 Dorn, deep in his beard. "He seeks control of farmers and
 wheat in the Northwest. Ranch after ranch he's gained by
 taking up and foreclosing mortgages. He's against labor. He
 grinds down the poor. He cheated Neuman out of a hundred
 thousand bushels of wheat. He bought up my debt. He meant
 to ruin me. He?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You're talking I.W.W. rot," whispered
 Kurt, shaking with the effort to subdue his feelings.
 "Anderson is fine, big, square?a developer of the
 Northwest. Not an enemy! He's our friend. Oh! if only you
 had an American's eyes, just for a minute!? Father, I
 want that money for Anderson."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My son, I run my own business,"
 replied Dorn, sullenly, with a pale fire in his opaque
 eyes. "You're a wild boy, unfaithful to your blood. You've
 fallen in love with an American girl.? Anderson says
 he needs money!"? With hard, gloomy face the old man
 shook his head. "He thinks he'll harvest!" Again that
 strange shake of finality. "I know what I know.? I
 keep my money.? We'll have other rule.? I keep
 my money."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt had vibrated to those most
 significant words and he stared speechless at his
 father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Go home. Get ready for harvest,"
 suddenly ordered old Dorn, as if he had just awakened to
 the fact of Kurt's disobedience in lingering here.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All right, father," replied Kurt,
 and, turning on his heel, he strode outdoors.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When he got beyond the light he turned
 and went back to a position where in the dark he could
 watch without being seen. His father and the hotel
 proprietor were again engaged in earnest colloquy. Neuman
 had disappeared. Kurt saw the huge shadow of a man pass
 across a drawn blind in a room up-stairs. Then he saw
 smaller shadows, and arms raised in vehement gesticulation.
 The very shadows were sinister. Men passed in and out of
 the hotel. Once old Dorn came to the door and peered all
 around. Kurt observed that there was a dark side entrance
 to this hotel. Presently Neuman returned to the desk and
 said something to old Dorn, who shook his head
 emphatically, and then threw himself into a chair, in a
 brooding posture that Kurt knew well. He had seen it so
 often that he knew it had to do with money. His father was
 refusing demands of some kind. Neuman again left the
 office, this time with the proprietor. They were absent
 some little time.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">During this period Kurt leaned against
 a tree, hidden in the shadow, with keen eyes watching and
 with puzzled, anxious mind. He had determined, in case his
 father left that office with Neuman, on one of those
 significant disappearances, to slip into the hotel at the
 side entrance and go up-stairs to listen at the door of the
 room with the closely drawn blind. Neuman returned soon
 with the hotel man, and the two of them half led, half
 dragged old Dorn out into the street. They took the
 direction toward the railroad. Kurt followed at a safe
 distance on the opposite side of the street. Soon they
 passed the stores with lighted windows, then several dark
 houses, and at length the railroad station. Perhaps they
 were bound for the train. Kurt heard rumbling in the
 distance. But they went beyond the station, across the
 track, and turned to the right.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt was soft-footed and keen-eyed. He
 just kept the dim shadows in range. They were heading for
 some freight-cars that stood upon a side-track. The dark
 figures disappeared behind them. Then one figure
 reappeared, coming back. Kurt crouched low. This man passed
 within a few yards of Kurt and he was whispering to
 himself. After he was safely out of earshot Kurt stole on
 stealthily until he reached the end of the freight-cars.
 Here he paused, listening. He thought he heard low voices,
 but he could not see the men he was following. No doubt
 they were waiting in the secluded gloom for the other men
 apparently necessary for that secret conference. Kurt had
 sensed this event and he had determined to be present. He
 tried not to conjecture. It was best for him to apply all
 his faculties to the task of slipping unseen and unheard
 close to these men who had involved his father in some dark
 plot.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Not long after Kurt hid himself on the
 other side of the freight-car he heard soft-padded
 footsteps and subdued voices. Dark shapes appeared to come
 out of the gloom. They passed him. He distinguished low,
 guttural voices, speaking German. These men, three in
 number, were scarcely out of sight when Kurt laid his rifle
 on the projecting shelf of the freight-car and followed
 them.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Presently he came to deep shadow,
 where he paused. Low voices drew him on again, then a light
 made him thrill. Now and then the light appeared to be
 darkened by moving figures. A dark object loomed up to cut
 off Kurt's view. It was a pile of railroad ties, and beyond
 it loomed another. Stealing along these, he soon saw the
 light again, quite close. By its glow he recognized his
 father's huge frame, back to him, and the burly Neuman on
 the other side, and Glidden, whose dark face was working as
 he talked. These three were sitting, evidently on a flat
 pile of ties, and the other two men stood behind. Kurt
 could not make out the meaning of the low voices. Pressing
 closer to the freight-car, he cautiously and noiselessly
 advanced.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Glidden was importuning with
 expressive hands and swift, low utterance. His face gleamed
 dark, hard, strong, intensely strung with corded, quivering
 muscles, with eyes apparently green orbs of fire. He spoke
 in German.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt dared not go closer unless he
 wanted to be discovered, and not yet was he ready for that.
 He might hear some word to help explain his father's
 strange, significant intimations about Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"?must?have?money,"
 Glidden was saying. To Kurt's eyes treachery gleamed in
 that working face. Neuman bent over to whisper gruffly in
 Dorn's ear. One of the silent men standing rubbed his hands
 together. Old Dorn's head was bowed. Then Glidden spoke so
 low and so swiftly that Kurt could not connect sentences,
 but with mounting blood he stood transfixed and horrified,
 to gather meaning from word on word, until he realized
 Anderson's doom, with other rich men of the Northwest, was
 sealed?that there were to be burnings of wheat-fields
 and of storehouses and of freight-trains?destruction
 everywhere.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I give money," said old Dorn, and
 with heavy movement he drew from inside his coat a large
 package wrapped in newspaper. He laid it before him in the
 light and began to unwrap it. Soon there were disclosed two
 bundles of bills?the eighty thousand dollars.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt thrilled in all his being. His
 poor father was being misled and robbed. A melancholy flash
 of comfort came to Kurt! Then at sight of Glidden's hungry
 eyes and working face and clutching hands Kurt pulled his
 hat far down, drew his revolver, and leaped forward with a
 yell, "Hands up!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He discharged the revolver right in
 the faces of the stunned plotters, and, snatching up the
 bundle of money, he leaped over the light, knocking one of
 the men down, and was gone into the darkness, without
 having slowed in the least his swift action.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Wheeling round the end of the
 freight-car, he darted back, risking a hard fall in the
 darkness, and ran along the several cars to the first one,
 where he grasped his rifle and kept on. He heard his
 father's roar, like that of a mad bull, and shrill yells
 from the other men. Kurt laughed grimly. They would never
 catch him in the dark. While he ran he stuffed the money
 into his inside coat pockets. Beyond the railroad station
 he slowed down to catch his breath. His breast was heaving,
 his pulse hammering, and his skin was streaming. The
 excitement was the greatest under which he had ever
 labored.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Now?what shall?I do?" he
 panted. A freight-train was lumbering toward him and the
 head-light was almost at the station. The train appeared to
 be going slowly through without stopping. Kurt hurried on
 down the track a little farther. Then he waited. He would
 get on that train and make his way somehow to Ruxton, there
 to warn Anderson of the plot against his life.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt rode to Adrian on that freight,
 and upon arriving in the yards there he jumped off, only to
 mount another, headed south. He meant to be traveling while
 it was dark. No passenger-trains ran at night and he wanted
 to put as much distance between him and Wheatly as possible
 before daylight.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He had piled into an open box-car. It
 was empty, at least of freight, and the floor appeared to
 have a thin covering of hay. The train, gathering headway,
 made a rattling rolling roar. Kurt hesitated about getting
 up and groping back in the pitch-black corners of the car.
 He felt that it contained a presence besides his own. And
 suddenly he was startled by an object blacker than the
 shadow, that sidled up close to him. Kurt could not keep
 the cold chills from chasing up and down his back. The
 object was a man, who reached for Kurt and felt of him with
 a skinny hand.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I.W.W.?" he whispered, hoarsely, in
 Kurt's ear.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes," replied Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Was that Adrian where you got
 on?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It sure was," answered Kurt, with
 grim humor.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Than you're the feller?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure," replied Kurt. It was evident
 that he had embarked upon an adventure.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"When do we stall this freight?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not while we're on it, you can
 gamble."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Other dark forms sidled out of the
 gloomy depths of that cavern-like corner and drew close to
 Kurt. He realized that he had fallen in with I.W.W. men who
 apparently had taken him for an expected messenger or
 leader. He was importuned for tobacco, drink, and money,
 and he judged that his begging companions consisted of an
 American tramp, an Austrian, a negro, and a German. Fine
 society to fall into! That eighty thousand dollars became a
 tremendous burden.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"How many men on this freight?"
 queried Kurt, thinking he could ask questions better than
 answer them. And he was told there were about twenty-five,
 all of whom expected money. At this information Kurt rather
 closely pressed his hand upon the revolver in his side coat
 pocket. By asking questions and making judicious replies he
 passed what he felt was the dark mark in that mixed company
 of I.W.W. men; and at length, one by one, they melted away
 to their warmer corners, leaving Kurt by the door. He did
 not mind the cold. He wanted to be where, at the first
 indication of a stop, he could jump off the train.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With his hand on his gun and hugging
 the bulging coat pockets close to him, Kurt settled himself
 for what he believed would be interminable hours. He
 strained eyes and ears for a possible attack from the
 riffraff I.W.W. men hidden there in the car. And that was
 why, perhaps, that it seemed only a short while until the
 train bumped and slowed, preparatory to stopping. The
 instant it was safe Kurt jumped out and stole away in the
 gloom. A fence obstructed further passage. He peered around
 to make out that he was in a road. Thereupon he hurried
 along it until he was out of hearing of the train. There
 was light in the east, heralding a dawn that Kurt surely
 would welcome. He sat down to wait, and addressed to his
 bewildered judgment a query as to whether or not he ought
 to keep on carrying the burdensome rifle. It was not only
 heavy, but when daylight came it might attract attention,
 and his bulging coat would certainly invite curiosity. He
 was in a predicament; nevertheless, he decided to hang on
 to the rifle.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He almost fell asleep, waiting there
 with his back against a fence-post. The dawn came, and then
 the rosy sunrise. And he discovered, not half a mile away,
 a good-sized town, where he believed he surely could hire
 an automobile.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Waiting grew to be so tedious that he
 decided to risk the early hour, and proceeded toward the
 town. Upon the outskirts he met a farmer boy, who, in reply
 to a question, said that the town was Connell. Kurt found
 another early riser in the person of a blacksmith who
 evidently was a Yankee and proud of it. He owned a car that
 he was willing to hire out on good security. Kurt satisfied
 him on that score, and then proceeded to ask how to get
 across the Copper River and into Golden Valley. The highway
 followed the railroad from that town to Kahlotus, and there
 crossed a big trunk-line railroad, to turn south toward the
 river.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">In half an hour, during which time
 Kurt was enabled to breakfast, the car was ready. It was a
 large car, rather ancient and the worse for wear, but its
 owner assured Kurt that it would take him where he wanted
 to go and he need not be afraid to drive fast. With that
 inspiring knowledge Kurt started off.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Before ten o'clock Kurt reached Kilo,
 far across the Copper River, with the Blue Mountains in
 sight, and from there less confusing directions to follow.
 He had been lucky. He had passed the wreck of the
 freight-train upon which he had ridden from Adrian; his car
 had been surrounded by rough men, and only quick wits saved
 him at least delay; he had been hailed by more than one
 group of tramping I.W.W. men; and he had passed camps and
 freight-yards where idlers were congregated. And lastly, he
 had seen, far across the valley, a pall of smoke from
 forest fire.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He was going to reach "Many Waters" in
 time to warn Anderson, and that fact gave him strange
 exultation. When it was assured and he had the eighty
 thousand dollars deposited in a bank he could feel that his
 gray, gloomy future would have several happy memories. How
 would Lenore Anderson feel toward a man who had saved her
 father? The thought was too rich, too sweet for Kurt to
 dwell upon.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Before noon Kurt began to climb
 gradually up off the wonderfully fertile bottom-lands where
 the endless orchards and boundless gardens delighted his
 eye, and the towns grew fewer and farther between. Kurt
 halted at Huntington for water, and when he was about ready
 to start a man rushed out of a store, glanced hurriedly up
 and down the almost deserted street, and, espying Kurt, ran
 to him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Message over 'phone! I.W.W.! Hell to
 pay!" he cried, excitedly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's up? Tell me the message,"
 replied Kurt, calmly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It just come?from Vale.
 Anderson, the big rancher! He 'phoned to send men out on
 all roads?to stop his car! His daughter's in it!
 She's been made off with! I.W.W.'s!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's heart leaped. The bursting
 blood burned through him and receded to leave him cold,
 tingling. Anything might happen to him this day! He reached
 inside the seat to grasp the disjointed rifle, and three
 swift movements seemed to serve to unwrap it and put the
 pieces together.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What else did Anderson say?" he
 asked, sharply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That likely the car would head for
 the hills, where the I.W.W.'s are camped."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What road from here leads that
 way?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Take the left-hand road at the end of
 town," replied the man, more calmly. "Ten miles down you'll
 come to a fork. There's where the I.W.W.'s will turn off to
 go up into the foot-hills. Anderson just 'phoned. You can
 head off his car if it's on the hill road. But you'll have
 to drive.? Do you know Anderson's car? Don't you want
 men with you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No time!" called Kurt, as he leaped
 into the seat and jammed on the power.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll send cars all over," shouted the
 man, as Kurt whirred away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's eyes and hands and feet hurt
 with the sudden intensity of strain. All his nervous force
 seemed set upon the one great task of driving and guiding
 that car at the limit of its speed. Huntington flashed
 behind, two indistinct streaks of houses. An open road,
 slightly rising, stretched ahead. The wind pressed so hard
 that he could scarcely breathe. The car gave forth a
 humming roar.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's heart labored, swollen and
 tight, high in his breast, and his thoughts were swift,
 tumultuous. An agony of dread battled with a dominating but
 strange certainty. He felt belief in his luck.
 Circumstances one by one had led to this drive, and in
 every one passed by he felt the direction of chance.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He sped by fields of wheat, a wagon
 that he missed by an inch, some stragglers on the road, and
 then, far ahead, he saw a sign-post of the forks. As he
 neared it he gradually shut off the power, to stop at the
 cross-roads. There he got out to search for fresh car
 tracks turning up to the right. There were none. If
 Anderson's car was coming on that road he would meet
 it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt started again, but at reasonable
 speed, while his eyes were sharp on the road ahead. It was
 empty. It sloped down for a long way, and made a wide curve
 to the right, along the base of hilly pastureland, and then
 again turned. And just as Kurt's keen gaze traveled that
 far a big automobile rounded the bend, coming fast. He
 recognized the red color, the shape of the car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Anderson's!" he cried, with that same
 lift of his heart, that bursting gush of blood. "No
 dream!? I see it!? And I'll stop it!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The advantage was all his. He would
 run along at reasonable speed, choose a narrow place, stop
 his car so as to obstruct the road, and get out with his
 rifle.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It seemed a long stretch down that
 long slope, and his car crept along while the other
 gradually closed the gap. Slower and slower Kurt ran, then
 turned half across the road and stopped. When he stepped
 out the other car was two hundred yards or more distant.
 Kurt saw when the driver slackened his speed. There
 appeared to be only two people in the car, both in front.
 But Kurt could not be sure of that until it was only fifty
 yards away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then he swung out his rifle and waved
 for the driver to stop. But he did not stop. Kurt heard a
 scream. He saw a white face. He saw the driver swing his
 hand across that white face, dashing it back.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Halt!" yelled Kurt, at the top of his
 lungs.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But the driver hunched down and put on
 the power. The red car leaped. As it flashed by Kurt
 recognized Nash and Anderson's daughter. She looked
 terrified. Kurt dared not shoot, for fear of hitting the
 girl. Nash swerved, took the narrow space left him,
 smashing the right front wheel of Kurt's car, and got
 by.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt stepped aside and took a quick
 shot at the tire of Nash's left hind wheel. He missed. His
 heart sank and he was like ice as he risked another. The
 little high-power bullet struck and blew the tire off the
 wheel. Nash's car lurched, skidded into the bank not thirty
 yards away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With a bound Kurt started for it, and
 he was there when Nash had twisted out of his seat and over
 the door.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Far enough! Don't move!" ordered
 Kurt, presenting the rifle.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash was ghastly white, with hunted
 eyes and open mouth, and his hands shook.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh it's?Kurt Dorn!" cried a
 broken voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt saw the girl fumble with the door
 on her side, open it, and stagger out of his sight. Then
 she reappeared round the car. Bareheaded, disheveled, white
 as chalk, with burning eyes and bleeding lips, she gazed at
 Kurt as if to make sure of her deliverance.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Miss Anderson?if he's harmed
 you?" broke out Kurt, hoarsely.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh!? Don't kill him!? He
 hasn't touched me," she replied, wildly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But your lips are bleeding."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Are they?" She put a trembling hand
 to them. "He?he struck me.? That's
 nothing? But you?you have saved me?from
 God only knows what!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I have! From him?" demanded Kurt.
 "What is he?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He's a German!" returned Lenore, and
 red burned out of the white of her cheeks. "Secret
 agent?I.W.W.!? Plotter against my father's
 life!? Oh, he knocked father off the
 car?dragged him!? He ran the car
 away?with me?forced me back?he struck
 me!? Oh, if I were a man!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Nash responded with a passion that
 made his face drip with sweat and distort into savage fury
 of defeat and hate.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You two-faced cat!" he hissed. "You
 made love to me! You fooled me! You let me?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Shut up!" thundered Kurt. "You German
 dog! I can't murder you, because I'm American. Do you get
 that? But I'll beat you within an inch of your life!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">As Kurt bent over to lay down the
 rifle, Nash darted a hand into the seat for weapon of some
 kind. But Kurt, in a rush, knocked him over the front
 guard. Nash howled. He scrambled up with bloody mouth. Kurt
 was on him again.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Take that!" cried Kurt, low and hard,
 as he swung his arm. The big fist that had grasped so many
 plow-handles took Nash full on that bloody mouth and laid
 him flat. "Come on, German! Get out of the trench!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Like a dog Nash thrashed and crawled,
 scraping his hands in the dirt, to jump up and fling a rock
 that Kurt ducked by a narrow margin. Nash followed it,
 swinging wildly, beating at his adversary.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Passion long contained burst in Kurt.
 He tasted the salt of his own blood where he had bitten his
 lips. Nash showed as in a red haze. Kurt had to get his
 hands on this German, and when he did it liberated a
 strange and terrible joy in him. No weapon would have
 sufficed. Hardly aware of Nash's blows, Kurt tore at him,
 swung and choked him, bore him down on the bank, and there
 beat him into a sodden, bloody-faced heap.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Only then did a cry of distress,
 seemingly from far off, pierce Kurt's ears. Miss Anderson
 was pulling at him with frantic hands.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, don't kill him! Please don't kill
 him!" she was crying. "Kurt!?for my sake, don't kill
 him!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That last poignant appeal brought Kurt
 to his senses. He let go of Nash. He allowed the girl to
 lead him back. Panting hard, he tried to draw a deep, full
 breath.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, he doesn't move!" whispered
 Lenore, with wide eyes on Nash.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Miss Anderson?he's
 not?even insensible," panted Kurt. "But he's
 licked?good and hard."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The girl leaned against the side of
 the car, with a hand buried in her heaving breast. She was
 recovering. The gray shade left her face. Her eyes, still
 wide and dark and beginning to glow with softer emotions,
 were upon Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You?you were the one to come,"
 she murmured. "I prayed. I was terribly frightened. Ruenke
 was taking me?to the I.W.W. camp, up in the
 hills."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Ruenke?" queried Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, that's his German name."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt awoke to the exigencies of the
 situation. Searching in the car, he found a leather belt.
 With this he securely bound Ruenke's hands behind his back,
 then rolled him down into the road.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My first German prisoner," said Kurt,
 half seriously. "Now, Miss Anderson, we must be doing
 things. We don't want to meet a lot of I.W.W.'s out here.
 My car is out of commission. I hope yours is not
 broken."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt got into the car and found, to
 his satisfaction, that it was not damaged so far as
 running-gear was concerned. After changing the ruined tire
 he backed down the road and turned to stop near where
 Ruenke lay. Opening the rear door, Kurt picked him up as if
 he had been a sack of wheat and threw him into the car.
 Next he secured the rifle that had been such a burden and
 had served him so well in the end.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Get in, Miss Anderson," he said, "and
 show me where to drive you home."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She got in beside him, making a
 grimace as she saw Ruenke lying behind her. Kurt started
 and ran slowly by the damaged car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He knocked a wheel off. I'll have to
 send back."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, I thought it was all over when we
 hit!" said the girl.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt experienced a relaxation that was
 weakening. He could hardly hold the wheel and his mood
 became one of exaltation.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father suspected this Ruenke," went
 on Lenore. "But he wanted to find out things from him. And
 I?I undertook?to twist Mr. Germany round my
 finger. I made a mess of it.? He lied. I didn't make
 love to him. But I listened to his love-making, and
 arrogant German love-making it was! I'm afraid I made eyes
 at him and let him believe I was smitten.? Oh, and
 all for nothing! I'm ashamed? But he lied!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Her confidence, at once pathetic and
 humorous and contemptuous, augmented Kurt's Homeric mood.
 He understood that she would not even let him, for a
 moment, have a wrong impression of her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It must have been hard," agreed Kurt.
 "Didn't you find out anything at all?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not much," she replied. Then she put
 a hand on his sleeve. "Your knuckles are all bloody."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So they are. I got that punching our
 German friend."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, how you did beat him!" she cried.
 "I had to look. My ire was up, too!? It wasn't very
 womanly?of me?that I gloried in the sight."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But you cried out?you pulled me
 away!" exclaimed Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That was because I was afraid you'd
 kill him," she replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt swerved his glance, for an
 instant, to her face. It was at once flushed and pale, with
 the deep blue of downcast eyes shadowy through her long
 lashes, exceedingly sweet and beautiful to Kurt's sight. He
 bent his glance again to the road ahead. Miss Anderson felt
 kindly and gratefully toward him, as was, of course,
 natural. But she was somehow different from what she had
 seemed upon the other occasions he had seen her. Kurt's
 heart was full to bursting.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I might have killed him," he said.
 "I'm glad?you stopped me. That?that frenzy of
 mine seemed to be the breaking of a dam. I have been dammed
 up within. Something had to break. I've been unhappy for a
 long time."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I saw that. What about?" she
 replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The war, and what it's done to
 father. We're estranged. I hate everything German. I loved
 the farm. My chance in life is gone. The wheat
 debt?the worry about the I.W.W.?and that's not
 all."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Again she put a gentle hand on his
 sleeve and left it there for a moment. The touch thrilled
 all through Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm sorry. Your position is sad. But
 maybe it is not utterly hopeless. You?you'll come
 back after the war."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I don't know that I want to come
 back," he said. "For then?it'd be just as
 bad?worse.? Miss Anderson, it won't hurt to
 tell you the truth.? A year ago?that first time
 I saw you?I fell in love with you. I think?when
 I'm away?over in France?I'd like to feel that
 you know. It can't hurt you. And it'll be sweet to
 me.? I fought against the?the madness. But fate
 was against me.? I saw you again.? And it was
 all over with me!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He paused, catching his breath. She
 was perfectly quiet. He looked on down the winding road.
 There were dust-clouds in the distance.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm afraid I grew bitter and moody,"
 he went on. "But the last forty-eight hours have changed me
 forever? I found that my poor old dad had been won
 over by these unscrupulous German agents of the I.W.W. But
 I saved his name.? I've got the money he took for the
 wheat we may never harvest. But if we do harvest I can pay
 all our debt.? Then I learned of a plot to ruin your
 father?to kill him!? I was on my way to 'Many
 Waters.' I can warn him.? Last of all I have saved
 you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The little hand dropped away from his
 coat sleeve. A soft, half-smothered cry escaped her. It
 seemed to him she was about to weep in her exceeding
 pity.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Miss Anderson, I?I'd rather not
 have?you pity me."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Dorn, I certainly don't pity
 you," she replied, with an unexpected, strange tone. It was
 full. It seemed to ring in his ears.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I know there never was and never
 could be any hope for me. I?I?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, you know that!" murmured the
 soft, strange voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But Kurt could not trust his ears and
 he had to make haste to terminate the confession into which
 his folly and emotion had betrayed him. He scarcely heard
 her words.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes.? I told you why I wanted
 you to know.? And now forget that?and when I'm
 gone?if you think of me ever, let it be about how
 much better it made me?to have all this good
 luck?to help your father and to save you!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The dust-cloud down the road came from
 a string of automobiles, flying along at express speed.
 Kurt saw them with relief.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Here come the cars on your trail," he
 called out. "Your father will be in one of them."</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt opened the door of the car and
 stepped down. He could not help his importance or his
 pride. Anderson, who came running between two cars that had
 stopped abreast, was coatless and hatless, covered with
 dust, pale and fire-eyed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Anderson, your daughter is
 safe?unharmed," Kurt assured him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My girl!" cried the father, huskily,
 and hurried to where she leaned out of her seat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All right, dad," she cried, as she
 embraced him. "Only a little shaky yet."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was affecting for Dorn to see that
 meeting, and through it to share something of its meaning.
 Anderson's thick neck swelled and colored, and his
 utterance was unintelligible. His daughter loosened her arm
 from round him and turned her face toward Kurt. Then he
 imagined he saw two blue stars, sweetly, strangely shining
 upon him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father, it was our friend from the
 Bend," she said. "He happened along."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson suddenly changed to the cool,
 smiling man Kurt remembered.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Howdy, Kurt?" he said, and crushed
 Kurt's hand. "What'd you do to him?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt made a motion toward the back of
 the car. Then Anderson looked over the seats. With that he
 opened the door and in one powerful haul he drew Ruenke
 sliding out into the road. Ruenke's bruised and bloody face
 was uppermost, a rather gruesome sight. Anderson glared
 down upon him, while men from the other cars crowded
 around. Ruenke's eyes resembled those of a cornered rat.
 Anderson's jaw bulged, his big hands clenched.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Bill, you throw this fellow in your
 car and land him in jail. I'll make a charge against him,"
 said the rancher.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Mr. Anderson, I can save some
 valuable time," interposed Kurt. "I've got to return a car
 I broke down. And there's my wheat. Will you have one of
 these men drive me back?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure. But won't you come home with
 us?" said Anderson.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'd like to. But I must get home,"
 replied Kurt. "Please let me speak a few words for your ear
 alone." He drew Anderson aside and briefly told about the
 eighty thousand dollars; threw back his coat to show the
 bulging pockets. Then he asked Anderson's advice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'd deposit the money an' wire the
 Spokane miller," returned the rancher. "I know him. He'll
 leave the money in the bank till your wheat is safe. Go to
 the national bank in Kilo. Mention my name."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then Kurt told Anderson of the plot
 against his fortunes and his life.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Neuman! I.W.W.! German intrigue!"
 growled the rancher. "All in the same class!? Dorn,
 I'm forewarned, an' that's forearmed. I'll beat this outfit
 at their own game."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">They returned to Anderson's car. Kurt
 reached inside for his rifle.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Aren't you going home with us?" asked
 the girl.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, Miss Anderson, I?I'm
 sorry. I?I'd love to see 'Many Waters,'" floundered
 Kurt. "But I can't go now. There's no need. I must hurry
 back to?to my troubles."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I wanted to tell you
 something?at home," she returned, shyly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Tell me now," said Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">She gave him such a glance as he had
 never received in his life. Kurt felt himself as wax before
 those blue eyes. She wanted to thank him. That would be
 sweet, but would only make his ordeal harder. He steeled
 himself.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You won't come?" she asked, and her
 smile was wistful.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No?thank you ever so much."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Will you come to see me before
 you?you go to war?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll try."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But you must promise. You've done so
 much for me and my father.? I?I want you to
 come to see me?at my home."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Then I'll come," he replied.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Anderson clambered into the car beside
 his daughter and laid his big hands on the wheel.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure he'll come, or we'll go after
 him," he declared, heartily. "So long, son."</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Late in the forenoon of the next day
 Kurt Dorn reached home. A hot harvest wind breathed off the
 wheat-fields. It swelled his heart to see the change in the
 color of that section of Bluestem?the gold had a
 tinge of rich, ripe brown.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's father awaited him, a haggard,
 gloomy-faced man, unkempt and hollow-eyed.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Was it you who robbed me?" he shouted
 hoarsely.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes," replied Kurt. He had caught the
 eager hope and fear in the old man's tone. Kurt expected
 that confession would bring on his father's terrible fury,
 a mood to dread. But old Dorn showed immense relief. He sat
 down in his relaxation from what must have been intense
 strain. Kurt saw a weariness, a shade, in the gray lined
 face that had never been there before.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What did you do with the money?"
 asked the old man.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I banked it in Kilo," replied Kurt.
 "Then I wired your miller in Spokane.? So you're safe
 if we can harvest the wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Old Dorn nodded thoughtfully. There
 had come a subtle change in him. Presently he asked Kurt if
 men had been hired for the harvest.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. I've not seen any I would trust,"
 replied Kurt, and then he briefly outlined Anderson's plan
 to insure a quick and safe harvesting of the grain. Old
 Dorn objected to this on account of the expense. Kurt
 argued with him and patiently tried to show him the
 imperative need of it. Dorn, apparently, was not to be won
 over; however, he was remarkably mild in comparison with
 what Kurt had expected.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Father, do you realize now that the
 men you were dealing with at Wheatly are dishonest? I mean
 with you. They would betray you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Old Dorn had no answer for this.
 Evidently he had sustained some kind of shock that he was
 not willing to admit.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Look here, father," went on Kurt, in
 slow earnestness. He spoke in English, because nothing
 would make him break his word and ever again speak a word
 of German. And his father was not quick to comprehend
 English. "Can't you see that the I.W.W. mean to cripple us
 wheat farmers this harvest?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No," replied old Dorn,
 stubbornly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But they do. They don't <i>want</i>
 work. If they accept work it is for a chance to do damage.
 All this I.W.W. talk about more wages and shorter hours is
 deceit. They make a bold face of discontent. That is all a
 lie. The I.W.W. is out to ruin the great wheat-fields and
 the great lumber forests of the Northwest."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I do not believe that," declared his
 father, stoutly. "What for?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt meant to be careful of that
 subject.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No matter what for. It does not make
 any difference what it's for. We've got to meet it to save
 our wheat.? Now won't you believe me? Won't you let
 me manage the harvest?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I will not believe," replied old
 Dorn, stubbornly. "Not about <i>my</i> wheat. I know they
 mean to destroy. They are against rich men like Anderson.
 But not me or my wheat!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"There is where you are wrong. I'll
 prove it in a very few days. But in that time I can prepare
 for them and outwit them. Will you let me?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Go ahead," replied old Dorn,
 gruffly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was a concession that Kurt was
 amazed and delighted to gain. And he set about at once to
 act upon it. He changed his clothes and satisfied his
 hunger; then, saddling his horse, he started out to visit
 his farmer neighbors.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The day bade fair to be rich in
 experience. Jerry, the foreman, was patrolling his long
 beat up and down the highway. Jerry carried a shot-gun and
 looked like a sentry. The men under him were on the other
 side of the section of wheat, and the ground was so rolling
 that they could not be seen from the highway. Jerry was
 unmistakably glad and relieved to see Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Some goin's-on," he declared, with a
 grin. "Since you left there's been one hundred and sixteen
 I.W.W. tramps along this here road."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Have you had any trouble?" inquired
 Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, I reckon it wasn't trouble, but
 every time I took a peg at some sneak I sort of broke out
 sweatin' cold."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You shot at them?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure I shot when I seen any loafin'
 along in the dark. Two of them shot back at me, an' after
 thet I wasn't particular to aim high.? Reckon I'm
 about dead for sleep."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll relieve you to-night," replied
 Kurt. "Jerry, doesn't the wheat look great?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, I reckon. An' walkin' along here
 when it's quiet an' no wind blowin', I can just hear the
 wheat crack. It's gittin' ripe fast, an' sure the biggest
 crop we ever raised.? But I'm tellin' you?when
 I think how we'll ever harvest it my insides just sinks
 like lead!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt then outlined Anderson's plan,
 which was received by the foreman with eager approval and
 the assurance that the neighbor farmers would rally to his
 call.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt found his nearest neighbor,
 Olsen, cutting a thin, scarcely ripe barley. Olsen was
 running a new McCormack harvester, and appeared delighted
 with the machine, but cast down by the grain prospects. He
 did not intend to cut his wheat at all. It was a dead
 loss.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Two sections?twelve hundred an'
 eighty acres!" he repeated, gloomily. "An' the third bad
 year! Dorn, I can't pay the interest to my bank."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Olsen's sun-dried and wind-carved
 visage was as hard and rugged and heroic as this desert
 that had resisted him for years. Kurt saw under the lines
 and the bronze all the toil and pain and unquenchable hope
 that had made Olsen a type of the men who had cultivated
 this desert of wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll give you five hundred dollars to
 help me harvest," said Kurt, bluntly, and briefly stated
 his plan.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Olsen whistled. He complimented
 Anderson's shrewd sense. He spoke glowingly of that
 magnificent section of wheat that absolutely must be saved.
 He promised Kurt every horse and every man on his farm. But
 he refused the five hundred dollars.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Oh, say, you'll have to accept it,"
 declared Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You've done me good turns," asserted
 Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But nothing like this. Why, this will
 be a rush job, with all the men and horses and machines and
 wagons I can get. It'll cost ten?fifteen thousand
 dollars to harvest that section. Even at that, and paying
 Anderson, we'll clear twenty thousand or more. Olsen,
 you've got to take the money."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All right, if you insist. I'm needin'
 it bad enough," replied Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Further conversation with Olsen
 gleaned the facts that he was the only farmer in their
 immediate neighborhood who did not have at least a little
 grain worth harvesting. But the amount was small and would
 require only slight time. Olsen named farmers that very
 likely would not take kindly to Dorn's proposition, and had
 best not be approached. The majority, however, would stand
 by him, irrespective of the large wage offered, because the
 issue was one to appeal to the pride of the Bend farmers.
 Olsen appeared surprisingly well informed upon the tactics
 of the I.W.W., and predicted that they would cause trouble,
 but be run out of the country. He made the shrewd
 observation that when even those farmers who sympathized
 with Germany discovered that their wheat-fields were being
 menaced by foreign influences and protected by the home
 government, they would experience a change of heart. Olsen
 said the war would be a good thing for the United States,
 because they would win it, and during the winning would
 learn and suffer and achieve much.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt rode away from Olsen in a more
 thoughtful frame of mind. How different and interesting the
 points of view of different men! Olsen had never taken the
 time to become a naturalized citizen of the United States.
 There had never been anything to force him to do it. But
 his understanding of the worth of the United States and his
 loyalty to it were manifest in his love for his wheatlands.
 In fact, they were inseparable. Probably there were
 millions of pioneers, emigrants, aliens, all over the
 country who were like Olsen, who needed the fire of the
 crucible to mold them into a unity with Americans. Of such,
 Americans were molded!</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt rode all day, and when, late that
 night, he got home, weary and sore and choked, he had
 enlisted the services of thirty-five farmers to help him
 harvest the now famous section of wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">His father had plainly doubted the
 willingness of these neighbors to abandon their own labors,
 for the Bend exacted toil for every hour of every season,
 whether rich or poor in yield. Likewise he was plainly
 moved by the facts. His seamed and shaded face of gloom had
 a moment of light.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"They will make short work of this
 harvest," he said, thoughtfully.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I should say so," retorted Kurt.
 "We'll harvest and haul that grain to the railroad in just
 three days."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Impossible!" ejaculated Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You'll see," declared Kurt. "You'll
 see who's managing this harvest."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He could not restrain his little
 outburst of pride. For the moment the great overhanging
 sense of calamity that for long had haunted him faded into
 the background. It did seem sure that they would save this
 splendid yield of wheat. How much that meant to
 Kurt?in freedom from debt, in natural love of the
 fruition of harvest, in the loyalty to his government! He
 realized how strange and strong was the need in him to
 prove he was American to the very core of his heart. He did
 not yet understand that incentive, but he felt it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">After eating dinner Kurt took his
 rifle and went out to relieve Jerry.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Only a few more days and nights!" he
 exclaimed to his foreman. "Then we'll have all the
 harvesters in the country right in our wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wal, a hell of a lot can happen
 before then," declared Jerry, pessimistically.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt was brought back to realities
 rather suddenly. But questioning Jerry did not elicit any
 new or immediate cause for worry. Jerry appeared tired
 out.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You go get some sleep," said
 Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All right. Bill's been dividin' this
 night watch with me. I reckon he'll be out when he wakes
 up," replied Jerry, and trudged away.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt shouldered his rifle and slowly
 walked along the road with a strange sense that he was
 already doing army duty in protecting property which was at
 once his own and his country's.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The night was dark, cool, and quiet.
 The heavens were starry bright. A faint breeze brought the
 tiny crackling of the wheat. From far distant came the bay
 of a hound. The road stretched away pale and yellow into
 the gloom. In the silence and loneliness and darkness, in
 all around him, and far across the dry, whispering fields,
 there was an invisible presence that had its affinity in
 him, hovered over him shadowless and immense, and waved in
 the bursting wheat. It was life. He felt the wheat
 ripening. He felt it in reawakened tenderness for his old
 father and in the stir of memory of Lenore Anderson. The
 past active and important hours had left little room for
 thought of her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But now she came back to him, a spirit
 in keeping with his steps, a shadow under the stars, a
 picture of sweet, wonderful young womanhood. His whole
 relation of thought toward her had undergone some marvelous
 change. The most divine of gifts had been granted
 him?an opportunity to save her from harm, perhaps
 from death. He had served her father. How greatly he could
 not tell, but if measured by the gratitude in her eyes it
 would have been infinite. He recalled that
 expression?blue, warm, soft, and indescribably
 strange with its unuttered hidden meaning. It was
 all-satisfying for him to realize that she had been
 compelled to give him a separate and distinct place in her
 mind. He must stand apart from all others she knew. It had
 been his fortune to preserve her happiness and the
 happiness that she must be to sisters and mother, and that
 some day she would bestow upon some lucky man. They would
 all owe it to him. And Lenore Anderson knew he loved
 her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">These things had transformed his
 relation of thought toward her. He had no regret, no
 jealousy, no fear. Even the pang of suppressed and
 overwhelming love had gone with his confession.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But he did remember her presence, her
 beauty, her intent blue glance, and the faint, dreaming
 smile of her lips?remembered them with a thrill, and
 a wave of emotion, and a contraction of his heart. He had
 promised to see her once more, to afford her the
 opportunity, no doubt, to thank him, to try to make him see
 her gratitude. He would go, but he wished it need not be.
 He asked no more. And seeing her again might change his
 fulness of joy to something of pain.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">So Kurt trod the long road in the
 darkness and silence, pausing, and checking his dreams now
 and then, to listen and to watch. He heard no suspicious
 sounds, nor did he meet any one. The night was melancholy,
 with a hint of fall in its cool breath.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Soon he would be walking a beat in one
 of the training-camps, with a bugle-call in his ears and
 the turmoil of thousands of soldiers in the making around
 him: soon, too, he would be walking the deck of a
 transport, looking back down the moon-blanched wake of the
 ship toward home, listening to the mysterious moan of the
 ocean; and then soon feeling under his feet the soil of a
 foreign country, with hideous and incomparable war
 shrieking its shell furies and its man anguish all about
 him. But no matter how far away he ever got, he knew Lenore
 Anderson would be with him as she was there on that dim,
 lonely starlit country road.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">And in these long hours of his vigil
 Kurt Dorn divined a relation between his love for Lenore
 Anderson and a terrible need that had grown upon him. A
 need of his heart and his soul! More than he needed her, if
 even in his wildest dreams he had permitted himself visions
 of an earthly paradise, he needed to prove to his blood and
 his spirit that he was actually and truly American. He had
 no doubt of his intelligence, his reason, his choice. The
 secret lay hidden in the depths of him, and he knew it came
 from the springs of the mother who had begotten him. His
 mother had given him birth, and by every tie he was mostly
 hers.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt had been in college during the
 first year of the world war. And his name, his fair hair
 and complexion, his fluency in German, and his remarkable
 efficiency in handicrafts had opened him to many a hint,
 many a veiled sarcasm that had stung him like a poison
 brand. There was injustice in all this war spirit. It
 changed the minds of men and women. He had not doubted
 himself until those terrible scenes with his father, and,
 though he had reacted to them as an American, he had felt
 the drawing, burning blood tie. He hated everything German
 and he knew he was wrong in doing so. He had clear
 conception in his mind of the difference between the German
 war motives and means, and those of the other nations.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's problem was to understand
 himself. His great fight was with his own soul. His
 material difficulties and his despairing love had suddenly
 been transformed, so that they had lent his spirit wings.
 How many poor boys and girls in America must be helplessly
 divided between parents and country! How many faithful and
 blind parents, obedient to the laws of mind and heart, set
 for all time, must see a favorite son go out to fight
 against all they had held sacred!</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That was all bad enough, but Kurt had
 more to contend with. No illusions had he of a chastened
 German spirit, a clarified German mind, an unbrutalized
 German heart. Kurt knew his father. What would change his
 father? Nothing but death! Death for himself or death for
 his only son! Kurt had an incalculable call to prove
 forever to himself that he was free. He had to spill his
 own blood to prove himself, or he had to spill that of an
 enemy. And he preferred that it should be his own. But that
 did not change a vivid and terrible picture which haunted
 him at times. He saw a dark, wide, and barren shingle of
 the world, a desert of desolation made by man, where
 strange, windy shrieks and thundering booms and awful cries
 went up in the night, and where drifting palls of smoke
 made starless sky, and bursts of reddish fires made
 hell.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly Kurt's slow pacing along the
 road was halted, as was the trend of his thought. He was
 not sure he had heard a sound. But he quivered all over.
 The night was far advanced now; the wind was almost still;
 the wheat was smooth and dark as the bosom of a resting
 sea. Kurt listened. He imagined he heard, far away, the
 faint roar of an automobile. But it might have been a train
 on the railroad. Sometimes on still nights he caught sounds
 like that.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then a swish in the wheat, a soft
 thud, very low, unmistakably came to Kurt's ear. He
 listened, turning his ear to the wind. Presently he heard
 it again?a sound relating both to wheat and earth. In
 a hot flash he divined that some one had thrown fairly
 heavy bodies into the wheat-fields. Phosphorus cakes! Kurt
 held his breath while he peered down the gloomy road, his
 heart pounding, his hands gripping the rifle. And when he
 descried a dim form stealthily coming toward him he yelled,
 "Halt!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Instantly the form wavered, moved
 swiftly, with quick pad of footfalls. Kurt shot
 once?twice?three times?and aimed as best
 he could to hit. The form either fell or went on out of
 sight in the gloom. Kurt answered the excited shouts of his
 men, calling them to come across to him. Then he went
 cautiously down the road, peering on the ground for a dark
 form. But he failed to find it, and presently had to admit
 that in the dark his aim had been poor. Bill came out to
 relieve Kurt, and together they went up and down the road
 for a mile without any glimpse of a skulking form. It was
 almost daylight when Kurt went home to get a few hours'
 sleep.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Next day was one of the rare,
 blistering-hot days with a furnace wind that roared over
 the wheat-fields. The sky was steely and the sun like
 copper. It was a day which would bring the wheat to a
 head.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At breakfast Jerry reported that fresh
 auto tracks had been made on the road during the night; and
 that dust and wheat all around the great field showed a
 fresh tramping.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt believed a deliberate and
 particular attempt had been made to insure the destruction
 of the Dorn wheat-field. And he ordered all hands out to
 search for the dangerous little cakes of phosphorus.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was difficult to find them. The
 wheat was almost as high as a man's head and very thick. To
 force a way through it without tramping it down took care
 and time. Besides, the soil was soft, and the agents who
 had perpetrated this vile scheme had perfectly matched the
 color. Kurt almost stepped on one of the cakes before he
 saw it. His men were very slow in finding any. But Kurt's
 father seemed to walk fatally right to them, for in a short
 hundred yards he found three. They caused a profound change
 in this gloomy man. Not a word did he utter, but he became
 animated by a tremendous energy.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The search was discouraging. It was
 like hunting for dynamite bombs that might explode at any
 moment. All Kurt's dread of calamity returned fourfold. The
 intense heat of the day, that would ripen the wheat to
 bursting, would likewise sooner or later ignite the cakes
 of phosphorus. And when Jerry found a cake far inside the
 field, away from the road, showing that powerful had been
 the arm that had thrown it there, and how impossible it
 would be to make a thorough search, Kurt almost succumbed
 to discouragement. Still, he kept up a frenzied hunting and
 inspired the laborers to do likewise.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">About ten o'clock an excited shout
 from Bill drew Kurt's attention, and he ran along the edge
 of the field. Bill was sweaty and black, yet through it all
 Kurt believed he saw the man was pale. He pointed with
 shaking hand toward Olsen's hill.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt vibrated to a shock. He saw a
 long circular yellow column rising from the hill, slanting
 away on the strong wind.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dust!" he cried, aghast.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Smoke!" replied Bill, hoarsely.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The catastrophe had fallen. Olsen's
 wheat was burning. Kurt experienced a profound sensation of
 sadness. What a pity! The burning of wheat?the
 destruction of bread?when part of the world was
 starving! Tears dimmed his eyes as he watched the swelling
 column of smoke.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Bill was cursing, and Kurt gathered
 that the farm-hand was predicting fires all around. This
 was inevitable. But it meant no great loss for most of the
 wheat-growers whose yield had failed. For Kurt and his
 father, if fire got a hold in their wheat, it meant ruin.
 Kurt's sadness was burned out by a slow and growing
 rage.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Bill, go hitch up to the big mower,"
 ordered Kurt. "We'll have to cut all around our field.
 Bring drinking water and whatever you can lay a hand on
 ? anything to fight fire!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Bill ran thumping away over the clods.
 Then it happened that Kurt looked toward his father. The
 old man was standing with his arms aloft, his face turned
 toward the burning wheat, and he made a tragic figure that
 wrung Kurt's heart.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jerry came running up. "Fire! Fire!
 Olsen's burnin'! Look! By all thet's dirty, them I.W.W.'s
 hev done it!? Kurt, we're in fer hell! Thet wind's
 blowin' straight this way."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jerry, we'll fight till we drop,"
 replied Kurt. "Tell the men and father to keep on searching
 for phosphorus cakes.? Jerry, you keep to the high
 ground. Watch for fires starting on our land. If you see
 one yell for us and make for it. Wheat burns slow till it
 gets started. We can put out fires if we're quick."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Kurt, there ain't no chance on earth
 fer us!" yelled Jerry, pale with anger. His big red hands
 worked. "If fire starts we've got to hev a lot of
 men.? By Gawd! if I ain't mad!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Don't quit, Jerry," said Kurt,
 fiercely. "You never can tell. It looks hopeless. But we'll
 never give up. Hustle now!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jerry shuffled off as old Dorn came
 haltingly, as if stunned, toward Kurt. But Kurt did not
 want to face his father at that moment. He needed to fight
 to keep up his own courage.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Never mind that!" yelled Kurt,
 pointing at Olsen's hill. "Keep looking for those damned
 pieces of phosphorus!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With that Kurt dove into the wheat,
 and, sweeping wide his arms to make a passage, he strode
 on, his eyes bent piercingly upon the ground close about
 him. He did not penetrate deeper into the wheat from the
 road than the distance he estimated a strong arm could send
 a stone. Almost at once his keen sight was rewarded. He
 found a cake of phosphorus half buried in the soil. It was
 dry, hard and hot either from the sun or its own generating
 power. That inspired Kurt. He hurried on. Long practice
 enabled him to slip through the wheat as a barefoot country
 boy could run through the corn-fields. And his passion gave
 him the eyes of a hunting hawk sweeping down over the
 grass. To and fro he passed within the limits he had
 marked, oblivious to time and heat and effort. And covering
 that part of the wheat-field bordering the road he
 collected twenty-seven cakes of phosphorus, the last few of
 which were so hot they burnt his hands.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then he had to rest. He appeared as
 wet as if he had been plunged into water; his skin burned,
 his eyes pained, his breast heaved. Panting and spent, he
 lay along the edge of the wheat, with closed eyelids and
 lax muscles.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When he recovered he rose and went
 back along the road. The last quarter of the immense
 wheat-field lay upon a slope of a hill, and Kurt had to
 mount this before he could see the valley. From the summit
 he saw a sight that caused him to utter a loud exclamation.
 Many columns of smoke were lifting from the valley, and
 before him the sky was darkened. Olsen's hill was as if
 under a cloud. No flames showed anywhere, but in places the
 line of smoke appeared to be approaching.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's a thousand to one against us,"
 he said, bitterly, and looked at his watch. He was amazed
 to see that three hours had passed since he had given
 orders to the men. He hurried back to the house. No one was
 there except the old servant, who was wringing her hands
 and crying that the house would burn. Throwing the cakes of
 phosphorus into a watering-trough, Kurt ran into the
 kitchen, snatched a few biscuits, and then made for the
 fields, eating as he went.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He hurried down a lane that bordered
 the big wheat-field. On this side was fallow ground for
 half the length of the section, and the other half was ripe
 barley, dry as tinder, and beyond that, in line with the
 burning fields, a quarter-section of blasted wheat. The men
 were there. Kurt saw at once that other men with horses and
 machines were also there. Then he recognized Olsen and two
 other of his neighbors. As he ran up he was equally
 astounded and out of breath, so that he could not speak.
 Old Dorn sat with gray head bowed on his hand.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hello!" shouted Olsen. His grimy face
 broke into a hard smile. "Fires all over! Wheat's burnin'
 like prairie grass! Them chips of phosphorus are sure from
 hell!? We've come over to help."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You?did! You left?your
 fields!" gasped Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure. They're not much to leave. And
 we're goin' to save this section of yours or bust
 tryin'!? I sent my son in his car, all over, to hurry
 men here with horses, machines, wagons."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt was overcome. He could only wring
 Olsen's hand. Here was an answer to one of his brooding,
 gloomy queries. Something would be gained, even if the
 wheat was lost. Kurt had scarcely any hope left.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's to be done?" he panted,
 hoarsely. In this extremity Olsen seemed a tower of
 strength. This sturdy farmer was of Anderson's breed, even
 if he was a foreigner. And he had fought fires before.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"If we have time we'll mow a line all
 around your wheat," replied Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Reckon we won't have time,"
 interposed Jerry, pointing to a smoke far down in the
 corner of the stunted wheat. "There's a fire startin'."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"They'll break out all over," said
 Olsen, and he waved a couple of his men away. One had a
 scythe and the other a long pole with a wet burlap bag tied
 on one end. They hurried toward the little cloud of
 smoke.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I found a lot of cakes over along the
 road," declared Kurt, with a grim surety that he had done
 that well.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"They've surrounded your wheat,"
 returned Olsen. "But if enough men get here we'll save the
 whole section.? Lucky you've got two wells an' that
 watertank. We'll need all the water we can get. Keep a man
 pumpin'. Fetch all the bags an' brooms an' scythes. I'll
 post lookouts along this lane to watch for fires breakin'
 out in the big field. When they do we've got to run an' cut
 an' beat them out.? It won't be long till most of
 this section is surrounded by fire."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Thin clouds of smoke were then blowing
 across the fields and the wind that carried them was laden
 with an odor of burning wheat. To Kurt it seemed to be the
 fragrance of baking bread.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"How'd it be to begin harvestin'?"
 queried Jerry. "Thet wheat's ripe."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No combines should be risked in there
 until we're sure the danger's past," replied Olsen. "There!
 I see more of our neighbors comin' down the road. We're
 goin' to beat the I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That galvanized Kurt into action and
 he found himself dragging Jerry back to the barns. They
 hitched a team to a heavy wagon, in record time, and then
 began to load with whatever was available for fighting
 fire. They loaded a barrel, and with huge buckets filled it
 with water. Leaving Jerry to drive, Kurt rushed back to the
 fields. During his short absence more men, with horses and
 machines, had arrived; fire had broken out in the stunted
 wheat, and also, nearer at hand, in the barley. Kurt saw
 his father laboring like a giant. Olsen was taking charge,
 directing the men. The sky was obscured now, and all the
 west was thick with yellow smoke. The south slopes and
 valley floor were clouding. Only in the east, over the
 hill, did the air appear clear. Back of Kurt, down across
 the barley and wheat on the Dorn land, a line of fire was
 creeping over the hill. This was on the property adjoining
 Olsen's. Gremniger, the owner, had abandoned his own
 fields. At the moment he was driving a mower along the edge
 of the barley, cutting a nine-foot path. Men behind him
 were stacking the sheaves. The wind was as hot as if from a
 blast-furnace; the air was thick and oppressive; the light
 of day was growing dim.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt, mounted on the seat of one of
 the combine threshers, surveyed with rapid and anxious gaze
 all the points around him, and it lingered over the
 magnificent sweep of golden wheat. The wheat bowed in waves
 before the wind, and the silken rustle, heard above the
 confusion of yelling men, was like a voice whispering to
 Kurt. Somehow his dread lessened then and other emotions
 predominated. He saw more and more farmers arrive, in cars,
 in wagons, with engines and threshers, until the lane was
 lined with them and men were hurrying everywhere.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly Kurt espied a slender column
 of smoke rising above the wheat out in front of him toward
 the highway. This was the first sign of fire in the great
 section that so many farmers had come to protect. Yelling
 for help, he leaped off the seat and ran with all his might
 toward the spot. Breasting that thick wheat was almost as
 hard as breasting waves. Jerry came yelling after him,
 brandishing a crude beater; and both of them reached the
 fire at once. It was a small circle, burning slowly. Madly
 Kurt rushed in to tear and stamp as if the little hissing
 flames were serpents. He burned his hands through his
 gloves and his feet through his boots. Jerry beat hard,
 accompanying his blows with profane speech plainly
 indicating that he felt he was at work on the I.W.W. In
 short order they put out this little fire. Returning to his
 post, Kurt watched until he was called to lend a hand down
 in the stunted wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Fire had crossed and had gotten a hold
 on Dorn's lower field. Here the wheat was blasted and so
 burned all the more fiercely. Horses and mowers had to be
 taken away to the intervening barley-field. A weird, smoky,
 and ruddy darkness enveloped the scene. Dim red fire, in
 lines and dots and curves, appeared on three sides, growing
 larger and longer, meeting in some places, crisscrossed by
 black figures of threshing men belaboring the flames. Kurt
 came across his father working like a mad-man. Kurt warned
 him not to overexert himself, and the father never heard.
 Now and then his stentorian yell added to the medley of
 cries and shouts and blows, and the roar of the wind
 fanning the flames.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt was put to beating fire in the
 cut wheat. He stood with flames licking at his boots. It
 was astonishing how tenacious the fire appeared, how it
 crept along, eating up the mowed wheat. All the men that
 could be spared there were unable to check it and keep it
 out of the standing grain. When it reached this line it
 lifted a blaze, flamed and roared, and burned like wildfire
 in grass. The men were driven back, threshing and beating,
 all to no avail. Kurt fell into despair. There was no hope.
 It seemed like an inferno.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Flaring high, the light showed the
 black, violently agitated forms of the fighters, and the
 clouds of yellow smoke, coalescing and drifting, changing
 to dark and soaring high.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Olsen had sent three mowers abreast
 down the whole length of the barley-field before the fire
 reached that line. It was a wise move, and if anything
 could do so it would save the day. The leaping flame, thin
 and high, and a mile long, curled down the last of the
 standing wheat and caught the fallen barley. But here its
 speed was checked. It had to lick a way along the
 ground.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">In desperation, in unabated fury, the
 little army of farmers and laborers, with no thought of
 personal gain, with what seemed to Kurt a wonderful and
 noble spirit, attacked this encroaching line of fire like
 men whose homes and lives and ideals had been threatened
 with destruction. Kurt's mind worked as swiftly as his
 tireless hands. This indeed was being in a front line of
 battle. The scene was weird, dark, fitful, at times
 impressive and again unreal. These neighbors of his, many
 of them aliens, some of them Germans, when put to this
 vital test, were proving themselves. They had shown little
 liking for the Dorns, but here was love of wheat, and so,
 in some way, loyalty to the government that needed it. Here
 was the answer of the Northwest to the I.W.W. No doubt if
 the perpetrators of that phosphorus trick could have been
 laid hold of then, blood would have been shed. Kurt sensed
 in the fierce energy, in the dark, grimy faces, shining and
 wet under the light, in the hoarse yell and answering
 shout, a nameless force that was finding itself and
 centering on one common cause.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">His old father toiled as ten men. That
 burly giant pushed ever in the lead, and his hoarse call
 and strenuous action told of more than a mercenary rage to
 save his wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Fire never got across that swath of
 cut barley. It was beaten out as if by a thousand men.
 Shadow and gloom enveloped the fighters as they rested
 where their last strokes had fallen. Over the hills faint
 reflection of dying flames lit up the dark clouds of smoke.
 The battle seemed won.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then came the thrilling cry: "Fire!
 Fire!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">One of the outposts came running out
 of the dark.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Fire! the other side! Fire!" rang out
 Olsen's yell.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt ran with the gang pell-mell
 through the dark, up the barley slope, to see a long red
 line, a high red flare, and lifting clouds of ruddy smoke.
 Fire in the big wheat-field! The sight inflamed him,
 carried him beyond his powers, and all he knew was that he
 became the center of a dark and whirling m?l?e
 encircled by living flames that leaped only to be beaten
 down. Whether that threshing chaos of fire and smoke and
 wheat was short or long was beyond him to tell but the fire
 was extinguished to the last spark.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Walking back with the weary crowd,
 Kurt felt a clearer breeze upon his face. Smoke was not
 flying so thickly. Over the western hill, through a rift in
 the clouds, peeped a star. The only other light he saw
 twinkled far down the lane. It was that of a lantern. Dark
 forms barred it now and then. Slowly Kurt recovered his
 breath. The men were talking and tired voices rang with
 assurance that the fire was beaten.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Some one called Kurt. The voice was
 Jerry's. It seemed hoarse and strained. Kurt could see the
 lean form of his man, standing in the light of the lantern.
 A small dark group of men, silent and somehow impressive,
 stood off a little in the shadow.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Here I am, Jerry," called Kurt,
 stepping forward. Just then Olsen joined Jerry.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, we've beat the I.W.W.'s,
 but?but?" he began, and broke off huskily.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's the matter?" queried Kurt, and
 a cold chill shot over him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jerry plucked at his sleeve.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Your old man?your
 dad?he's overworked hisself," whispered Jerry. "It's
 tough.? Nobody could stop him."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt felt that the fulfilment of his
 icy, sickening dread had come. Jerry's dark face, even in
 the uncertain light, was tragic.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, his heart went back on
 him?he's dead!" said Olsen, solemnly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt pushed the kind hands aside. A
 few steps brought him to where, under the light of the
 lantern, lay his father, pale and still, with a strange
 softening of the iron cast of intolerance.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dead!" whispered Kurt, in awe and
 horror. "Father! Oh, he's gone!?without a
 word?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Again Jerry plucked at Kurt's
 sleeve.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I was with him," said Jerry. "I heard
 him fall an' groan.? I had the light. I bent over,
 lifted his head.? An' he said, speaking English,
 'Tell my son?I was wrong!'? Then he died. An'
 thet was all."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt staggered away from the
 whispering, sympathetic foreman, out into the darkness,
 where he lifted his face in the thankfulness of a breaking
 heart.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It had, indeed, taken the approach of
 death to change his hard old father. "Oh, he
 meant?that if he had his life to live over
 again?he would be different!" whispered Kurt. That
 was the one great word needed to reconcile Kurt to his
 father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The night had grown still except for
 the murmuring of the men. Smoke veiled the horizon. Kurt
 felt an intense and terrible loneliness. He was indeed
 alone in the world. A hard, tight contraction of throat
 choked back a sob. If only he could have had a word with
 his father! But no grief, nothing could detract from the
 splendid truth of his father's last message. In the black
 hours soon to come Kurt would have that to sustain him.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The bright sun of morning disclosed
 that wide, rolling region of the Bend to be a dreary,
 blackened waste surrounding one great wheat-field, rich and
 mellow and golden.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt Dorn's neighbor, Olsen, in his
 kind and matter-of-fact way, making obligation seem slight,
 took charge of Kurt's affairs, and made the necessary and
 difficult decisions. Nothing must delay the harvesting and
 transporting of the wheat. The women folk arranged for the
 burial of old Chris Dorn.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt sat and moved about in a gloomy
 kind of trance for a day and a half, until his father was
 laid to rest beside his mother, in the little graveyard on
 the windy hill. After that his mind slowly cleared. He kept
 to himself the remainder of that day, avoiding the crowd of
 harvesters camping in the yard and adjacent field; and at
 sunset he went to a lonely spot on the verge of the valley,
 where with sad eyes he watched the last rays of sunlight
 fade over the blackened hills. All these hours had seemed
 consecrated to his father's memory, to remembered acts of
 kindness and of love, of the relation that had gone and
 would never be again. Reproach and remorse had abided with
 him until that sunset hour, when the load eased off his
 heart.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Next morning he went out to the
 wheat-field.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">What a wonderful harvesting scene
 greeted Kurt Dorn! Never had its like been seen in the
 Northwest, nor perhaps in any other place. A huge pall of
 dust, chaff, and smoke hung over the vast wheat-field, and
 the air seemed charged with a roar. The glaring gold of the
 wheat-field appeared to be crisscrossed everywhere with
 bobbing black streaks of horses?bays, blacks, whites,
 and reds; by big, moving painted machines, lifting arms and
 puffing straw; by immense wagons piled high with sheaves of
 wheat, lumbering down to the smoking engines and the
 threshers that sent long streams of dust and chaff over the
 lifting straw-stacks; by wagons following the combines to
 pick up the plump brown sacks of wheat; and by a string of
 empty wagons coming in from the road.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Olsen was rushing thirty combine
 threshers, three engine threshing-machines, forty
 wagon-teams, and over a hundred men well known to him.
 There was a guard around the field. This unprecedented
 harvest had attracted many spectators from the little
 towns. They had come in cars and on horseback and on foot.
 Olsen trusted no man on that field except those he
 knew.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The wonderful wheat-field was cut into
 a thousand squares and angles and lanes and curves. The big
 whirring combines passed one another, stopped and waited
 and turned out of the way, leaving everywhere little
 patches and cubes of standing wheat, that soon fell before
 the onslaught of the smaller combines. This scene had no
 regularity. It was one of confusion; of awkward halts,
 delays, hurries; of accident. The wind blew clouds of dust
 and chaff, alternately clearing one space to cloud another.
 And a strange roar added the last heroic touch to this
 heroic field. It was indeed the roar of battle?men
 and horses governing the action of machinery, and all
 fighting time. For in delay was peril to the wheat.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Once Kurt ran across the tireless and
 implacable Olsen. He seemed a man of dust and sweat and
 fury.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"She's half cut an' over twenty
 thousand bushels gone to the railroad!" he exclaimed. "An'
 we're speedin' up."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen, I don't get what's going on,"
 replied Kurt. "All this is like a dream."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Wake up. You'll be out of debt an' a
 rich man in three days," added Olsen, and went his way.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">In the afternoon Kurt set out to work
 as he had never worked in his life. There was need of his
 strong hands in many places, but he could not choose any
 one labor and stick by it for long. He wanted to do all. It
 was as if this was not a real and wonderful harvest of his
 father's greatest wheat yield, but something that embodied
 all years, all harvests, his father's death, the lifting of
 the old, hard debt, the days when he had trod the fields
 barefoot, and this day when, strangely enough, all seemed
 over for him. Peace dwelt with him, yet no hope. Behind his
 calm he could have found the old dread, had he cared to
 look deeply. He loved these heroic workers of the fields.
 It had been given to him?a great task?to be the
 means of creating a test for them, his neighbors under a
 ban of suspicion; and now he could swear they were as true
 as the gold of the waving wheat. More than a harvest was
 this most strenuous and colorful of all times ever known in
 the Bend; it had a significance that uplifted him. It was
 American.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">First Kurt began to load bags of
 wheat, as they fell from the whirring combines, into the
 wagons. For his powerful arms a full bag, containing two
 bushels, was like a toy for a child. With a lift and a
 heave he threw a bag into a wagon. They were everywhere,
 these brown bags, dotting the stubble field, appearing as
 if by magic in the wake of the machines. They rolled off
 the platforms. This toil, because it was hard and heavy,
 held Kurt for an hour, but it could not satisfy his
 enormous hunger to make that whole harvest his own. He
 passed to pitching sheaves of wheat and then to driving in
 the wagons. From that he progressed to a seat on one of the
 immense combines, where he drove twenty-four horses. No
 driver there was any surer than Kurt of his aim with the
 little stones he threw to spur a lagging horse. Kurt had
 felt this when, as a boy, he had begged to be allowed to
 try his hand; he liked the shifty cloud of fragrant chaff,
 now and then blinding and choking him; and he liked the
 steady, rhythmic tramps of hooves and the roaring whir of
 the great complicated machine. It fascinated him to see the
 wide swath of nodding wheat tremble and sway and fall, and
 go sliding up into the inside of that grinding maw, and
 come out, straw and dust and chaff, and a slender stream of
 gold filling the bags.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This day Kurt Dorn was gripped by the
 unknown. Some far-off instinct of future drove him, set his
 spiritual need, and made him register with his senses all
 that was so beautiful and good and heroic in the scene
 about him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Strangely, now and then a thought of
 Lenore Anderson entered his mind and made sudden havoc. It
 tended to retard action. He trembled and thrilled with a
 realization that every hour brought closer the meeting he
 could not avoid. And he discovered that it was whenever
 this memory recurred that he had to leave off his present
 task and rush to another. Only thus could he forget
 her.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The late afternoon found him feeding
 sheaves of wheat to one of the steam-threshers. He stood
 high upon a platform and pitched sheaves from the wagons
 upon the sliding track of the ponderous, rattling
 threshing-machine. The engine stood off fifty yards or
 more, connected by an endless driving-belt to the thresher.
 Here indeed were whistle and roar and whir, and the shout
 of laborers, and the smell of smoke, sweat, dust, and
 wheat. Kurt had arms of steel. If they tired he never knew
 it. He toiled, and he watched the long spout of chaff and
 straw as it streamed from the thresher to lift, magically,
 a glistening, ever-growing stack. And he felt, as a last
 and cumulative change, his physical effort, and the
 physical adjuncts of the scene, pass into something
 spiritual, into his heart and his memory.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The end of that harvest-time came as a
 surprise to Kurt. Obsessed with his own emotions, he had
 actually helped to cut the wheat and harvest it; he had
 seen it go swath by swath, he had watched the huge wagons
 lumber away and the huge straw-stacks rise without
 realizing that the hours of this wonderful harvest were
 numbered.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Sight of Olsen coming in from across
 the field, and the sudden cessation of roar and action,
 made Kurt aware of the end. It seemed a calamity. But Olsen
 was smiling through his dust-caked face. About him were
 relaxation, an air of finality, and a subtle pride.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We're through," he said. "She tallies
 thirty-eight thousand, seven hundred an' forty-one bushels.
 It's too bad the old man couldn't live to hear that."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Olsen gripped Kurt's hand and wrung
 it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, I reckon you ought to take that
 a little cheerfuller," he went on. "But?well it's
 been a hard time.? The men are leavin' now. In two
 hours the last wagons will unload at the railroad. The
 wheat will all be in the warehouse. An' our worry's
 ended."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I?I hope so," responded Kurt.
 He seemed overcome with the passionate longing to show his
 gratitude to Olsen. But the words would not flow.
 "I?I don't know how to thank you.? All my
 life?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We beat the I.W.W.," interposed the
 farmer, heartily. "An' now what'll you do, Dorn?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why, I'll hustle to Kilo, get my
 money, send you a check for yourself and men, pay off the
 debt to Anderson, and then?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But Kurt did not conclude his speech.
 His last words were thought-provoking.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's turned out well," said Olsen,
 with satisfaction, and, shaking hands again with Kurt, he
 strode back to his horses.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">At last the wide, sloping field was
 bare, except for the huge straw-stacks. A bright procession
 lumbered down the road, led by the long strings of wagons
 filled with brown bags. A strange silence had settled down
 over the farm. The wheat was gone. That waving stretch of
 gold had fallen to the thresher and the grain had been
 hauled away. The neighbors had gone, leaving Kurt rich in
 bushels of wheat, and richer for the hearty farewells and
 the grips of horny hands. Kurt's heart was full.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was evening. Kurt had finished his
 supper. Already he had packed a few things to take with him
 on the morrow. He went out to the front of the house. Stars
 were blinking. There was a low hum of insects from the
 fields. He missed the soft silken rustle of the wheat. And
 now it seemed he could sit there in the quiet darkness, in
 that spot which had been made sweet by Lenore Anderson's
 presence, and think of her, the meeting soon to come. The
 feeling abiding with him then must have been happiness,
 because he was not used to it. Without deserving anything,
 he had asked a great deal of fate, and, lo! it had been
 given him. All was well that ended well. He realized now
 the terrible depths of despair into which he had allowed
 himself to be plunged. He had been weak, wrong, selfish.
 There was something that guided events.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He needed to teach himself all this,
 with strong and repeated force, so that when he went to
 give Lenore Anderson the opportunity to express her
 gratitude, to see her sweet face again, and to meet the
 strange, warm glance of her blue eyes, so mysterious and
 somehow mocking, he could be a man of restraint, of pride,
 like any American, like any other college man she knew.
 This was no time for a man to leave a girl bearing a burden
 of his unsolicited love, haunted, perhaps, by a generous
 reproach that she might have been a little to blame. He had
 told her the truth, and so far he had been dignified. Now
 let him bid her good-by, leaving no sorrow for her, and,
 once out of her impelling presence, let come what might
 come. He could love her then; he could dare what he had
 never dared; he could surrender himself to the furious,
 insistent sweetness of a passion that was sheer bliss in
 its expression. He could imagine kisses on the red lips
 that were not for him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">A husky shout from somewhere in the
 rear of the house diverted Kurt's attention. He listened.
 It came again. His name! It seemed a strange call from out
 of the troubled past that had just ended. He hurried
 through the house to the kitchen. The woman stood holding a
 lamp, staring at Jerry.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Jerry appeared to have sunk against
 the wall. His face was pallid, with drops of sweat standing
 out, with distorted, quivering lower jaw. He could not look
 at Kurt. He could not speak. With shaking hand he pointed
 toward the back of the house.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Filled with nameless dread, Kurt
 rushed out. He saw nothing unusual, heard nothing. Rapidly
 he walked out through the yard, and suddenly he saw a glow
 in the sky above the barns. Then he ran, so that he could
 get an unobstructed view of the valley.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The instant he obtained this he halted
 as if turned to stone. The valley was a place of yellow
 light. He stared. With the wheat-fields all burned, what
 was the meaning of such a big light? That broad flare had a
 center, low down on the valley floor. As he gazed a
 monstrous flame leaped up, lighting colossal pillars of
 smoke that swirled upward, and showing plainer than in day
 the big warehouse and lines of freight-cars at the railroad
 station, eight miles distant.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My God!" gasped Kurt. "The
 warehouse?my wheat?on fire!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Clear and unmistakable was the
 horrible truth. Kurt heard the roar of the sinister flames.
 Transfixed, he stood there, at first hardly able to see and
 to comprehend. For miles the valley was as light as at
 noonday. An awful beauty attended the scene. How lurid and
 sinister the red heart of that fire? How weird and hellish
 and impressive of destruction those black, mountain-high
 clouds of smoke! He saw the freight-cars disappear under
 this fierce blazing and smoking pall. He watched for what
 seemed endless moments. He saw the changes of that fire,
 swift and terrible. And only then did Kurt Dorn awaken to
 the full sense of the calamity.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"All that work?Olsen's
 sacrifice?and the farmers'?my father's
 death?all for nothing!" whispered Kurt. "They only
 waited?those fiends?to fire the warehouse and
 the cars!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The catastrophe had fallen. The wheat
 was burning. He was ruined. His wheatland must go to
 Anderson. Kurt thought first and most poignantly of the
 noble farmers who had sacrificed the little in their
 wheat-fields to save the much in his. Never could he repay
 them.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then he became occupied with a
 horrible heat that seemed to have come from the burning
 warehouse to all his pulses and veins and to his heart and
 his soul.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This fiendish work, as had been
 forecast, was the work of the I.W.W. Behind it was Glidden
 and perhaps behind him was the grasping, black lust of
 German might. Kurt's loss was no longer abstract or
 problematical. It was a loss so real and terrible that it
 confounded him. He shook and gasped and reeled. He wrung
 his hands and beat his breast while the tumult swayed him,
 the physical hate at last yielding up its significance.
 What then, was his great loss? He could not tell. The thing
 was mighty, like the sense of terror and loneliness in the
 black night. Not the loss for his farmer neighbors, so true
 in his hour of trial! Not the loss of his father, nor the
 wheat, nor the land, nor his ruined future! But it must be
 a loss, incalculable and insupportable, to his soul. His
 great ordeal had been the need, a terrible and
 incomprehensible need, to kill something intangible in
 himself. He had meant to do it. And now the need was
 shifted, subject to a baser instinct. If there was German
 blood in him, poisoning the very wells of his heart he
 could have spilled it, and so, whether living or dead, have
 repudiated the taint. That was now clear in his
 consciousness. But a baser spark had ignited all the
 primitive passion of the forebears he felt burning and
 driving within him. He felt no noble fire. He longed to
 live, to have a hundredfold his strength and fury, to be
 gifted with a genius for time and place and bloody deed, to
 have the war-gods set him a thousand opportunities, to beat
 with iron mace and cut with sharp bayonet and rend with
 hard hand?to kill and kill and kill the hideous thing
 that was German.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt rushed back to the house.
 Encountering Jerry, he ordered him to run and saddle a
 couple of horses. Then Kurt got his revolver and a box of
 shells, and, throwing on his coat, he hurried to the barn.
 Jerry was leading out the horses. It took but short work to
 saddle them. Jerry was excited and talkative. He asked Kurt
 many questions, which excited few replies.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When Kurt threw himself into the
 saddle Jerry yelled, "Which way?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Down the trail!" replied Kurt, and
 was off.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Aw, we'll break our necks!" came
 Jerry's yell after him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt had no fear of the dark. He knew
 that trail almost as well by night as by day. His horse was
 a mettlesome colt that had not been worked during the
 harvest, and he plunged down the dim, winding trail as if,
 indeed, to verify Jerry's fears. Presently the thin, pale
 line that was the trail disappeared on the burned
 wheat-ground. Here Kurt was at fault as to direction, but
 he did not slacken the pace for that. He heard Jerry
 pounding along in the rear, trying to catch up. The way the
 colt jumped ditches and washes and other obstructions
 proved his keen sight. Kurt let him go. And then the ride
 became both perilous and thrilling.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt could not see anything on the
 blackened earth. But he knew from the contour of the hills
 just about where to expect to reach the fence and the road.
 And he did not pull the horse too soon. When he found the
 gate he waited for Jerry, who could be heard calling from
 the darkness. Kurt answered him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Here's the gate!" yelled Kurt, as
 Jerry came galloping up. "Good road all the way now!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Lickity-cut then!" shouted Jerry to
 whom the pace had evidently communicated enthusiasm.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The ride then became a race, with Kurt
 drawing ahead. Kurt could see the road, a broad, pale belt,
 dividing the blackness on either side; and he urged the
 colt to a run. The wind cut short Kurt's breath, beat at
 his ears, and roared about them. Closer and closer drew the
 red flare of the dying fire, casting long rays of light
 into Kurt's eyes.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The colt was almost run out when he
 entered the circle of reddish flare. Kurt saw the glowing
 ruins of the elevators and a long, fiery line of box-cars
 burned to the wheels. Men were running and shouting round
 in front of the little railroad station, and several were
 on the roof with brooms and buckets. The freight-house had
 burned, and evidently the station itself had been on fire.
 Across the wide street of the little village the roof of a
 cottage was burning. Men were on top of it, beating the
 shingles. Hoarse yells greeted Kurt as he leaped out of the
 saddle. He heard screams of frightened women. On the other
 side of the burned box-cars a long, thin column of sparks
 rose straight upward. Over the ruins of the elevators hung
 a pall of heavy smoke. Just then Jerry came galloping up,
 his lean face red in the glow.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Thet you, Kurt! Say, the sons of guns
 are burnin' down the town." He leaped off. "Lemme have your
 bridle. I'll tie the hosses up. Find out what we can
 do."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt ran here and there, possessed by
 impotent rage. The wheat was gone! That fact gave him a
 hollow, sickening pang. He met farmers he knew. They all
 threw up their hands at sight of him. Not one could find a
 voice. Finally he met Olsen. The little wheat farmer was
 white with passion. He carried a gun.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hello, Dorn! Ain't this hell? They
 got your wheat!" he said hoarsely.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen! How'd it happen? Wasn't
 anybody set to guard the elevators?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes. But the I.W.W.'s drove all the
 guards off but Grimm, an' they beat him up bad. Nobody had
 nerve enough to shoot."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen, if I run into the Glidden I'll
 kill him," declared Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So will I.? But, Dorn, they're
 a hard crowd. They're over there on the side, watchin' the
 fire. A gang of them! Soon as I can get the men together
 we'll drive them out of town. There'll be a fight, if I
 don't miss my guess."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hurry the men! Have all of them get
 their guns! Come on!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not yet, Dorn. We're fightin' fire
 yet. You an' Jerry help all you can."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, it appeared there was danger
 of more than one cottage burning. The exceedingly dry
 weather of the past weeks had made shingles like tinder,
 and wherever a glowing spark fell on them there straightway
 was a smoldering fire. Water, a scarce necessity in that
 region, had been used until all wells and pumps became dry.
 It was fortunate that most of the roofs of the little
 village had been constructed of galvanized iron. Beating
 out blazes and glowing embers with brooms was not effective
 enough. When it appeared that the one cottage nearest the
 rain of sparks was sure to go, Kurt thought of the railroad
 watertank below the station. He led a number of men with
 buckets to the tank, and they soon drowned out the
 smoldering places.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile the blazes from the box-cars
 died out, leaving only the dull glow from the red heap that
 had once been the elevators. However, this gave forth light
 enough for any one to be seen a few rods distant. Sparks
 had ceased to fall, and from that source no further danger
 need be apprehended. Olsen had been going from man to man,
 sending those who were not armed home for guns. So it came
 about that half an hour after Kurt's arrival a score of
 farmers, villagers, and a few railroaders were collected in
 a group, listening to the pale-faced Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Men, there's only a few of us, an'
 there's hundreds, mebbe, in thet I.W.W. gang, but we've got
 to drive them off," he said, doggedly. "There's no tellin'
 what they'll do if we let them hang around any longer. They
 know we're weak in numbers. We've got to do some shootin'
 to scare them away."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt seconded Olsen in ringing
 voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"They've threatened your homes," he
 said. "They've burned my wheat?ruined me. They were
 the death of my father.? These are facts I'm telling
 you. We can't wait for law or for militia. We've got to
 meet this I.W.W. invasion. They have taken advantage of the
 war situation. They're backed by German agents. It's now a
 question of our property. We've got to fight!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The crowd made noisy and determined
 response. Most of them had small weapons; a few had
 shot-guns or rifles.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Come on, men," called Olsen. "I'll do
 the talkin'. An' if I say shoot, why, you shoot!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was necessary to go around the long
 line of box-cars. Olsen led the way, with Kurt just back of
 him. The men spoke but little and in whispers. At the left
 end of the line the darkness was thick enough to make
 objects indistinct.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Once around the corner, Kurt plainly
 descried a big dark crowd of men whose faces showed red in
 the glow of the huge pile of embers which was all that
 remained of the elevators. They did not see Olsen's
 men.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hold on," whispered Olsen. "If we get
 in a fight here we'll be in a bad place. We've nothin' to
 hide behind. Let's go off?more to the left?an'
 come up behind those freight-cars on the switches. That'll
 give us cover an' we'll have the I.W.W.'s in the
 light."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">So he led off to the left, keeping in
 the shadow, and climbed between several lines of
 freight-cars, all empty, and finally came out behind the
 I.W.W.'s. Olsen led to within fifty yards of them, and was
 halted by some observant member of the gang who sat with
 the others on top of a flat-car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This man's yell stilled the coarse
 talk and laughter of the gang.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's that?" shouted a cold, clear
 voice with authority in it.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt thought he recognized the voice,
 and it caused a bursting, savage sensation in his
 blood.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Here's a bunch of farmers with guns!"
 yelled the man from the flat-car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Olsen halted his force near one of the
 detached lines of box-cars, which he probably meant to take
 advantage of in case of a fight.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hey, you I.W.W.'s!" he shouted, with
 all his might.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There was a moment's silence.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"There's no I.W.W.'s here," replied
 the authoritative voice.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt was sure now that he recognized
 Glidden's voice. Excitement and anger then gave place to
 deadly rage.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Who are you?" yelled Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We're tramps watchin' the fire," came
 the reply.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You set that fire!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, we didn't."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt motioned Olsen to be silent, as
 with lifting breast he took an involuntary step
 forward.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Glidden, I know you!" he shouted, in
 hard, quick tones. "I'm Kurt Dorn. I've met you. I know
 your voice.? Take your gang?get out of
 here?or we'll kill you!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">This pregnant speech caused a blank
 dead silence. Then came a white flash, a sharp report. Kurt
 heard the thud of a bullet striking some one near him. The
 man cried out, but did not fall.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Spread out an' hide!" ordered Olsen.
 "An' shoot fer keeps!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The little crowd broke and melted into
 the shadows behind and under the box-cars. Kurt crawled
 under a car and between the wheels, from which
 vantage-point he looked out. Glidden's gang were there in
 the red glow, most of them now standing. The sentry who had
 given the alarm still sat on top of the flat-car, swinging
 his legs. His companions, however, had jumped down. Kurt
 heard men of his own party crawling and whispering behind
 him, and he saw dim, dark, sprawling forms under the far
 end of the car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boss, the hayseeds have run off,"
 called the man from the flat car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Laughter and jeers greeted this
 sally.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt concluded it was about time to
 begin proceedings. Resting his revolver on the side of the
 wheel behind which he lay, he took steady aim at the
 sentry, holding low. Kurt was not a good shot with a
 revolver and the distance appeared to exceed fifty yards.
 But as luck would have it, when he pulled trigger the
 sentry let out a loud bawl of terror and pain, and fell off
 the car to the ground. Flopping and crawling like a
 crippled chicken, he got out of sight below.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's shot was a starter for Olsen's
 men. Four or five of the shot-guns boomed at once; then the
 second barrels were discharged, along with a sharper
 cracking of small arms. Pandemonium broke loose in
 Glidden's gang. No doubt, at least, of the effectiveness of
 the shot-guns! A medley of strange, sharp, enraged, and
 anguished cries burst upon the air, a prelude to a wild
 stampede. In a few seconds that lighted spot where the
 I.W.W. had grouped was vacant, and everywhere were fleeing
 forms, some swift, others slow. So far as Kurt could see,
 no one had been fatally injured. But many had been hurt,
 and that fact augured well for Olsen's force.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Presently a shot came from some hidden
 enemy. It thudded into the wood of the car over Kurt. Some
 one on his side answered it, and a heavy bullet, striking
 iron, whined away into the darkness. Then followed flash
 here and flash there, with accompanying reports and
 whistles of lead. From behind and under and on top of cars
 opened up a fire that proved how well armed these so-called
 laborers were. Their volley completely drowned the
 desultory firing of Olsen's squad.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt began to wish for one of the
 shot-guns. It was this kind of weapon that saved Olsen's
 followers. There were a hundred chances to one of missing
 an I.W.W. with a single bullet, while a shot-gun, aimed
 fairly well, was generally productive of results. Kurt
 stopped wasting his cartridges. Some one was hurt behind
 his car and he crawled out to see. A villager named Schmidt
 had been wounded in the leg, not seriously, but bad enough
 to disable him. He had been using a double-barreled
 breech-loading shot-gun, and he wore a vest with rows of
 shells in the pockets across the front. Kurt borrowed gun
 and ammunition; and with these he hurried back to his
 covert, grimly sure of himself. At thought of Glidden he
 became hot all over, and this heat rather grew with the
 excitement of battle.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">With the heavy fowling-piece loaded,
 Kurt peeped forth from behind his protecting wheel and
 watched keenly for flashes or moving dark figures. The
 I.W.W. had begun to reserve their fire, to shift their
 positions, and to spread out, judging from a wider range of
 the reports. It looked as if they meant to try and surround
 Olsen's band. It was extraordinary?the assurance and
 deadly intent of this riffraff gang of tramp
 labor-agitators. In preceding years a crowd of I.W.W. men
 had been nothing to worry a rancher. Vastly different it
 seemed now. They acted as if they had the great war back of
 them.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt crawled out of his hiding-place,
 and stole from car to car, in search of Olsen. At last he
 found the rancher, in company with several men, peering
 from behind a car. One of his companions was sitting down
 and trying to wrap something round his foot.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen, they're spreading out to
 surround us," whispered Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's what Bill here just said,"
 replied Olsen, nervously. "If this keeps up we'll be in a
 tight place. What'll we do, Dorn?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We mustn't break and run, of all
 things," said Kurt. "They'd burn the village. Tell our men
 to save their shells.? If I only could get some
 cracks at a bunch of them together?with this big
 shot-gun!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, we've been watchin' that
 car?the half-size one, there?next the high
 box-car," whispered Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's full of them. Sometimes we see a
 dozen shots come from it, all at once."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen, I've an idea," returned Kurt,
 excitedly. "You fellows keep shooting?attract their
 attention. I'll slip below, climb on top of a box-car, and
 get a rake-off at that bunch."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It's risky, Dorn," said Olsen, with
 hesitation. "But if you could get in a few tellin'
 shots?start that gang on the run!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll try it," rejoined Kurt, and
 forthwith stole off back toward the shadow. It struck him
 that there was more light then when the attack began. The
 fire had increased, or perhaps the I.W.W. had started
 another; at any rate, the light was growing stronger, and
 likewise the danger greater. As he crossed an open space a
 bullet whizzed by him, and then another zipped by to strike
 up the gravel ahead. These were not random shots. Some one
 was aiming at him. How strange and rage-provoking to be
 shot at deliberately! What a remarkable experience for a
 young wheat farmer! Raising wheat in the great Northwest
 had assumed responsibilities. He had to run, and he was the
 more furious because of that. Another bullet, flying wide,
 hummed to his left before he gained the shelter of the
 farthest line of freight-cars. Here he hid and watched. The
 firing appeared to be all behind him, and, thus encouraged,
 he stole along to the end of the line of cars, and around.
 A bright blaze greeted his gaze. An isolated car was on
 fire. Kurt peered forth to make sure of his bearings, and
 at length found the high derrick by which he had marked the
 box-car that he intended to climb.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He could see plainly, and stole up to
 his objective point, with little risk to himself until he
 climbed upon the box-car. He crouched low, almost on hands
 and knees, and finally gained the long shadow of a shed
 between the tracks. Then he ran past the derrick to the
 dark side of the car. He could now plainly see the revolver
 flashes and could hear the thud and spang of their bullets
 striking. Drawing a deep breath, Kurt climbed up the iron
 ladder on the dark side of the car.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He had the same sensation that
 possessed him when he was crawling to get a pot-shot at a
 flock of wild geese. Only this was mightily more exciting.
 He did not forget the risk. He lay flat and crawled little
 by little. Every moment he expected to be discovered. Olsen
 had evidently called more of his men to his side, for they
 certainly were shooting diligently. Kurt heard a continuous
 return fire from the car he was risking so much to get a
 shot at. At length he was within a yard of the end of the
 car?as far as he needed to go. He rested a moment. He
 was laboring for breath, sweating freely, on fire with
 thrills.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">His plan was to raise himself on one
 knee and fire as many double shots as possible. Presently
 he lifted his head to locate the car. It was half in the
 bright light, half in the shadow, lengthwise toward him,
 about sixty or seventy yards distant, and full of men. He
 dropped his head, tingling all over. It was a
 disappointment that the car stood so far away. With fine
 shot he could not seriously injure any of the I.W.W.
 contingent, but he was grimly sure of the fright and hurt
 he could inflict. In his quick glance he had seen flashes
 of their guns, and many red faces, and dark, huddled
 forms.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt took four shells and set them,
 end up, on the roof of the car close to him. Then, cocking
 the gun, he cautiously raised himself to one knee. He
 discharged both barrels at once. What a boom and what a
 terrified outburst of yells! Swiftly he broke the gun,
 reloaded, fired as before, and then again. The last two
 shots were fired at the men piling frantically over the
 side of the car, yelling with fear. Kurt had heard the
 swishing pattering impact of those swarms of small shot.
 The I.W.W. gang ran pell-mell down the open track, away
 from Kurt and toward the light. As he reloaded the gun he
 saw men running from all points to join the gang. With an
 old blunderbuss of a shot-gun he had routed the I.W.W. It
 meant relief to Olsen's men; but Kurt had yet no
 satisfaction for the burning of his wheat, for the cruel
 shock that had killed his father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Come on, Olsen!" he yelled, at the
 top of his lungs. "They're a lot of cowards!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Then in his wild eagerness he leaped
 off the car. The long jump landed him jarringly, but he did
 not fall or lose hold of the gun. Recovering his balance,
 he broke into a run. Kurt was fast on his feet. Not a young
 man of his neighborhood nor any of his college-mates could
 outfoot him in a race. And then these I.W.W. fellows ran
 like stiff-legged tramps, long unused to such mode of
 action. And some of them were limping as they ran. Kurt
 gained upon them. When he got within range he halted short
 and freed two barrels. A howl followed the report. Some of
 the fleeing ones fell, but were dragged up and on by
 companions. Kurt reloaded and, bounding forward like a
 deer, yelling for Olsen, he ran until he was within range,
 then stopped to shoot again. Thus he continued until the
 pursued got away from the circle of light. Kurt saw the
 gang break up, some running one way and some another. There
 were sheds and cars and piles of lumber along the track,
 affording places to hide. Kurt was halted by the discovery
 that he had no more ammunition. Panting, he stopped short,
 realizing that he had snapped an empty gun at men either
 too tired or too furious or too desperate to run any
 farther.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"He's out of shells!" shouted a low,
 hard voice that made Kurt leap. He welcomed the rush of
 dark forms, and, swinging the gun round his head, made
 ready to brain the first antagonist who neared him. But
 some one leaped upon him from behind. The onslaught carried
 him to his knees. Bounding up, he broke the gun stock on
 the head of his assailant, who went down in a heap. Kurt
 tried to pull his revolver. It became impossible, owing to
 strong arms encircling him. Wrestling, he freed himself,
 only to be staggered by a rush of several men, all pouncing
 upon him at once. Kurt went down, but, once down, he heaved
 so powerfully that he threw off the whole crew. Up again,
 like a cat, he began to fight. Big and strong and swift,
 with fists like a blacksmith's, Kurt bowled over this
 assailant and that one. He thought he recognized Glidden in
 a man who kept out of his reach and who was urging on the
 others. Kurt lunged at him and finally got his hands on
 him. That was fatal for Kurt, because in his fury he forgot
 Glidden's comrades. In one second his big hand wrenched a
 yell of mortal pain out of Glidden; then a combined attack
 of the others rendered Kurt powerless. A blow on the head
 stunned him?made all dark.</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It seemed that Kurt did not altogether
 lose consciousness, for he had vague sensations of being
 dragged along the ground. Presently the darkness cleared
 from his mind and he opened his eyes. He lay on his back.
 Looking up, he saw stars through the thin, broken clouds of
 smoke. A huge pile of railroad ties loomed up beside
 him.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He tried to take note of his
 situation. His hands were tied in front of him, not so
 securely, he imagined, that he could not work them free.
 His legs had not been tied. Both his head and shoulder, on
 the left side, pained him severely. Upon looking around,
 Kurt presently made out the dark form of a man. He appeared
 rigid with attention, but that evidently had no relation to
 Kurt. The man was listening and watching for his comrades.
 Kurt heard no voices or shots. After a little while,
 however, he thought he heard distant footsteps on the
 gravel. He hardly knew what to make of his predicament. If
 there was only one guard over him, escape did not seem
 difficult, unless that guard had a gun.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hello, you!" he called.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hello, yourself" replied the man,
 jerking up in evident surprise.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What's your name?" inquired Kurt,
 amiably.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, it ain't J.J. Hill or
 Anderson," came the gruff response.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt laughed. "But you would be one of
 those names if you could, now wouldn't you?" went on
 Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"My name is Dennis," gloomily returned
 the man.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"It certainly is. <i>That</i> is the
 name of all I.W.W.'s," said Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Say, are you the fellow who had the
 shot-gun?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I sure am," replied Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I ought to knock you on the
 head."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Because I'll have to eat standing up
 for a month."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes?" queried Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The seat of my pants must have made a
 good target, for you sure pasted it full of birdshot."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt smothered a laugh. Then he felt
 the old anger leap up. "Didn't you burn my wheat?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Are you that young Dorn?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, I am," replied Kurt, hotly.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, I didn't burn one damn straw of
 your old wheat."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You didn't! But you're with these
 men? You're an I.W.W. You've been fighting these farmers
 here."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"If you want to know, I'm a tramp,"
 said the man, bitterly. "Years ago I was a prosperous
 oil-producer in Ohio. I had a fine oil-field. Along comes a
 big fellow, tries to buy me out, and, failing that, he shot
 off dynamite charges into the ground next my
 oil-field.? Choked my wells! Ruined me!? I came
 west?went to farming. Along comes a corporation,
 steals my water for irrigation?and my land went back
 to desert.? So I quit working and trying to be
 honest. It doesn't pay. The rich men are getting all the
 richer at the expense of the poor. So now I'm a tramp."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Friend, that's a hard-luck story,"
 said Kurt. "It sure makes me think.? But I'll tell
 you what?you don't belong to this I.W.W. outfit, even
 if you are a tramp."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Why not?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Because you're American! That's
 why."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, I know I am. But I can be
 American and travel with a labor union, can't I?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No. This I.W.W. is no labor union. It
 never was. Their very first rule is to abolish capital.
 They're anarchists. And now they're backed by German money.
 The I.W.W. is an enemy to America. All this hampering of
 railroads, destruction of timber and wheat, is an aid to
 Germany in the war. The United States is at war! My God!
 man, can't you see it's your own country that must suffer
 for such deals as this wheat-burning to-night?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The hell you say!" ejaculated the
 man, in amaze.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"This Glidden is a German
 agent?perhaps a spy. He's no labor leader. What does
 he care for the interests of such men as you?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Young man, if you don't shut up
 you'll give me a hankering to go back to real work."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I hope I do. Let me give you a hunch.
 Throw down this I.W.W. outfit. Go to Ruxton and get
 Anderson of 'Many Waters' ranch to give you a job. Tell him
 who you are and that I sent you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Anderson of 'Many Waters,' hey? Well,
 maybe it'll surprise you to know that Glidden is operating
 there, has a lot of men there, and is going there from
 here."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"No, it doesn't surprise me. I hope he
 does go there. For if he does he'll get killed."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sssssh!" whispered the guard. "Here
 comes some of the gang."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt heard low voices and soft
 footfalls. Some dark forms loomed up.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Bradford, has he come to yet?"
 queried the brutal voice of Glidden.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Nope," replied the guard. "I guess he
 had a hard knock. He's never budged."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We've got to beat it out of here,"
 said Glidden. "It's long after midnight. There's a
 freight-train down the track. I want all the gang to board
 it. You run along, Bradford, and catch up with the
 others."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"What're you going to do with this
 young fellow?" queried Bradford, curiously.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's none of your business,"
 returned Glidden.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Maybe not. But I reckon I'll ask,
 anyhow. You want me to join your I.W.W., and I'm asking
 questions. Labor strikes?standing up for your
 rights?is one thing, and burning wheat or slugging
 young farmers is another. Are you going to let this Dorn
 go?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt could plainly see the group of
 five men, Bradford standing over the smaller Glidden, and
 the others strung and silent in the intensity of the
 moment.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll cut his throat," hissed
 Glidden.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Bradford lunged heavily. The blow he
 struck Glidden was square in the face. Glidden would have
 had a hard fall but for the obstruction in the shape of his
 comrades, upon whom he was knocked. They held him up.
 Glidden sagged inertly, evidently stunned or unconscious.
 Bradford backed guardedly away out of their reach, then,
 wheeling, he began to run with heavy, plodding strides.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Glidden's comrades seemed anxiously
 holding him up, peering at him, but no one spoke. Kurt saw
 his opportunity. With one strong wrench he freed his hands.
 Feeling in his pocket for his gun, he was disturbed to find
 that it had been taken. He had no weapon. But he did not
 hesitate. Bounding up, he rushed like a hurricane upon the
 unprepared group. He saw Glidden's pale face upheld to the
 light of the stars, and by it saw that Glidden was
 recovering. With all his might Kurt swung as he rushed, and
 the blow he gave the I.W.W. leader far exceeded Bradford's.
 Glidden was lifted so powerfully against one of his men
 that they both fell. Then Kurt, striking right and left,
 beat down the other two, and, leaping over them, he bounded
 away into the darkness. Shrill piercing yells behind him
 lent him wings.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">But he ran right into another group of
 I.W.W. men, dozens in number, he thought, and by the light
 of what appeared to be a fire they saw him as quickly as he
 saw them. The yells behind were significant enough. Kurt
 had to turn to run back, and he had to run the gauntlet of
 the men he had assaulted. They promptly began to shoot at
 Kurt. The whistle of lead was uncomfortably close. Never
 had he run so fleetly. When he flashed past the end of the
 line of cars, into comparative open, he found himself in
 the light of a new fire. This was a shed perhaps a score of
 rods or less from the station. Some one was yelling beyond
 this, and Kurt thought he recognized Jerry's voice, but he
 did not tarry to make sure. Bullets scattering the gravel
 ahead of him and singing around his head, and hoarse cries
 behind, with a heavy-booted tread of pursuers, gave Kurt
 occasion to hurry. He flew across the freight-yard,
 intending to distance his pursuers, then circle round the
 station to the village.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Once he looked back. The gang, well
 spread out, was not far behind him, just coming into the
 light of the new fire. No one in it could ever catch him,
 of that Kurt was sure.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly a powerful puff of air, like
 a blast of wind, seemed to lift him. At the same instant a
 dazzling, blinding, yellow blaze illuminated the whole
 scene. The solid earth seemed to rock under Kurt's flying
 feet, and then a terrific roar appalled him. He was thrown
 headlong through the air, and all about him seemed streaks
 and rays and bursts of fire. He alighted to plow through
 the dirt until the momentum of force had been expended.
 Then he lay prone, gasping and choking, almost blind, but
 sensitive to the rain of gravel and debris, the fearful
 cries of terrified men, taste of smoke and dust, and the
 rank smell of exploded gasoline.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt got up to grope his way through
 the murky darkness. He could escape now. If that explosion
 had not killed his pursuers it had certainly scared them
 off. He heard men running and yelling off to the left. A
 rumble of a train came from below the village. Finally Kurt
 got clear of the smoke, to find that he had wandered off
 into one of the fields opposite the station. Here he halted
 to rest a little and to take cognizance of his condition.
 It surprised him to find out that he was only bruised,
 scratched, and sore. He had expected to find himself full
 of bullets.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Whew! They blew up the
 gasoline-shed!" he soliloquized. "But some of them
 miscalculated, for if I don't lose my guess there was a
 bunch of I.W.W. closer to that gasoline than I was.?
 Some adventure!? I got another punch at Glidden. I
 felt it in my bones that I'd get a crack at him. Oh, for
 another!? And that Bradford! He did make me think.
 How he slugged Glidden! Good! Good! There's your old
 American spirit coming out."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt sat down to rest and to listen.
 He found he needed a rest. The only sound he heard was the
 rumbling of a train, gradually drawing away. A heavy smoke
 rose from the freight-yard, but there were no longer any
 blazes or patches of red fire. Perhaps the explosion had
 smothered all the flames.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It had been a rather strenuous
 evening, he reflected. A good deal of satisfaction lay in
 the fact that he had severely punished some of the I.W.W.
 members, if he had not done away with any of them.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When he thought of Glidden, however,
 he did not feel any satisfaction. His fury was gone, but in
 its place was a strong judgment that such men should be
 made examples. He certainly did not want to run across
 Glidden again, because if he did he would have blood on his
 hands.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt's chance meeting with the man
 Bradford seemed far the most interesting, if not thrilling,
 incident of the evening. It opened up a new point of view.
 How many of the men of that motley and ill-governed I.W.W.
 had grievances like Bradford's? Perhaps there were many.
 Kurt tried to remember instances when, in the Northwest
 wheat country, laborers and farmers had been cheated or
 deceived by men of large interests. It made him grave to
 discover that he could recall many such instances. His own
 father had long nursed a grievance against Anderson.
 Neuman, his father's friend, had a hard name. And there
 were many who had profited by the misfortune of others.
 That, after all, was a condition of life. He took it for
 granted, then, that all members of the I.W.W. were not
 vicious or dishonest. He was glad to have this proof. The
 I.W.W. had been organized by labor agitators, and they were
 the ones to blame, and their punishment should be severest.
 Kurt began to see where the war, cruel as it would be, was
 going to be of immeasurable benefit to the country.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It amazed Kurt, presently, to note
 that dawn was at hand. He waited awhile longer, wanting to
 be sure not to meet any lingering members of the I.W.W. It
 appeared, indeed, that they had all gone.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He crossed the freight-yard. A black
 ruin, still smoldering, lay where the elevators had been.
 That wonderful wheat yield of his had been destroyed. In
 the gray dawn it was hard to realize. He felt a lump in his
 throat. Several tracks were littered with the remains of
 burned freight-cars. When Kurt reached the street he saw
 men in front of the cottages. Some one hailed him, and then
 several shouted. They met him half-way. Jerry and Olsen
 were in the party.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We was pretty much scared," said
 Jerry, and his haggard face showed his anxiety.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Boy, we thought the I.W.W. had made
 off with you," added Olsen, extending his hand.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Not much! Where are they?" replied
 Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Gone on a freight-train. When Jerry
 blew up the gasoline-shed that fixed the I.W.W."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jerry, did you do that?" queried
 Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I reckon."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Well, you nearly blew me off the map.
 I was running, just below the shed. When that explosion
 came I was lifted and thrown a mile. Thought I'd never
 light!"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"So far as we can tell, nobody was
 killed," said Olsen. "Some of our fellows have got
 bullet-holes to nurse. But no one is bad hurt."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"That's good. I guess we came out
 lucky," replied Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You must have had some fight, runnin'
 off that way after the I.W.W.'s. We heard you shootin' an'
 the I.W.W.'s yellin'. That part was fun. Tell us what
 happened to you."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">So Kurt had to narrate his experiences
 from the time he stole off with the big shot-gun until his
 friends saw him again. It made rather a long story, which
 manifestly was of exceeding interest to the villagers.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dorn," said one of the men, "you an'
 Jerry saved this here village from bein' burned."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"We all had a share. I'm sure glad
 they're gone. Now what damage was done?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It turned out that there had been
 little hurt to the property of the villagers. Some
 freight-cars full of barley, loaded and billed by the
 railroad people, had been burned, and this loss of grain
 would probably be paid for by the company. The loss of
 wheat would fall upon Kurt. In the haste of that great
 harvest and its transportation to the village no provision
 had been made for loss. The railroad company had not
 accepted his wheat for transportation, and was not
 liable.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen, according to our agreement I
 owe you fifteen thousand dollars," said Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes, but forget it," replied Olsen.
 "You're the loser here."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"I'll pay it," replied Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But, boy, you're ruined!" ejaculated
 the farmer. "You can't pay that big price now. An' we don't
 expect it."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Didn't you leave your burning fields
 to come help us save ours?" queried Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Sure. But there wasn't much of mine
 to burn."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"And so did many of the other men who
 came to help. I tell you, Olsen, that means a great deal to
 me. I'll pay my debt or?or?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"But how can you?" interrupted Olsen,
 reasonably. "Sometime, when you raise another crop like
 this year, then you could pay."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"The farm will bring that much more
 than I owe Anderson."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You'll give up the farm?" exclaimed
 Olsen.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Yes. I'll square myself."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Dorn, we won't take that money," said
 the farmer, deliberately.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"You'll have to take it. I'll send you
 a check soon?perhaps to-morrow."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Give up your land!" repeated Olsen.
 "Why, that's unheard of! Land in your family so many
 years!? What will you do?"</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Olsen, I waited for the draft just on
 account of my father. If it had not been for him I'd have
 enlisted. Anyway, I'm going to war."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">That silenced the little group of
 grimy-faced men.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Jerry, get our horses and we'll ride
 home," said Kurt.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The tall foreman strode off. Kurt
 sensed something poignant in the feelings of the men,
 especially Olsen. This matter of the I.W.W. dealing had
 brought Kurt and his neighbors closer together. And he
 thought it a good opportunity for a few words about the
 United States and the war and Germany. So he launched forth
 into an eloquent expression of some of his convictions. He
 was still talking when Jerry returned with the horses. At
 length he broke off, rather abruptly, and, saying good-by,
 he mounted.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Hold on, Kurt," called Olsen, and
 left the group to lay a hand on the horse and to speak low.
 "What you said struck me deep. It applies pretty hard to us
 of the Bend. We've always been farmers, with no thought of
 country. An' that's because we left our native country to
 come here. I'm not German an' I've never been for Germany.
 But many of my neighbors an' friends are Germans. This war
 never has come close till now. I know Germans in this
 country. They have left their fatherland an' they are lost
 to that fatherland!? It may take some time to stir
 them up, to make them see, but the day will come.?
 Take my word for it, Dorn, the German-Americans of the
 Northwest, when it comes to a pinch, will find themselves
 an' be true to the country they have adopted."</p><br>

 <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The sun was up, broad and bright,
 burning over the darkened wheat-fields, when Kurt and Jerry
 reached home. Kurt had never seen the farm look like
 that?ugly and black and bare. But the fallow ground,
 hundreds of acres of it, billowing away to the south, had
 not suffered any change of color or beauty. To Kurt it
 seemed to smile at him, to bid him wait for another
 spring.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">And that thought was poignant, for he
 remembered he must leave at once for "Many Waters."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">He found, when he came to wash the
 blood and dirt from his person, that his bruises were many.
 There was a lump on his head, and his hands were skinned.
 After changing his clothes and packing a few things in a
 valise, along with his papers, he went down to breakfast.
 Though preoccupied in mind, he gathered that both the old
 housekeeper and Jerry were surprised and dismayed to see
 him ready to leave. He had made no mention of his
 intentions. And it struck him that this, somehow, was going
 to be hard.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, when the moment came he found
 that speech was difficult and his voice not natural.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">"Martha?Jerry?I'm going
 away for good," he said, huskily. "I mean to make over the
 farm to Mr. Anderson. I'll leave you in charge
 here?and recommend that you be kept on. Here's your
 money up to date.? I'm going away to the
 war?and the chances are I'll never come back."</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The old housekeeper, who had been like
 a mother to him for many years, began to cry; and Jerry
 struggled with a regret that he could not speak.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Abruptly Kurt left them and hurried
 out of the house. How strange that difficult feelings had
 arisen?emotions he had never considered at all! But
 the truth was that he was leaving his home forever. All was
 explained in that.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">First he went to the graves of his
 father and mother, out on the south slope, where there were
 always wind and sun. The fire had not desecrated the simple
 burying-ground. There was no grass. But a few trees and
 bushes kept it from appearing bare.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Kurt sat down in the shade near his
 mother's grave and looked away across the hills with dim
 eyes. Something came to him?a subtle assurance that
 his mother approved of his going to war. Kurt remembered
 her?slow, quiet, patient, hard-working, dominated by
 his father.</p><br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The slope was hot and still, with only
 a rustling of leaves in the wind. The air was dry. Kurt
 missed the sweet fragrance of wheat. What odor there was
 seemed to be like that of burning weeds. The great,
 undulating open of the Bend extended on three sides. His
 parents had spent the best of their lives there and had now
 been taken to the bosom of the soil they loved. It seemed
 natural. Many were the last resting-places of toilers of
 the wheat there on those hills. And surely in the long
 frontier days, and in the ages before, men innumerable had
 gone back to the earth from which they had sprung. The
 dwelling-places of men were beautiful; it was only life
 that was sad. In this poignant, revealing hour Kurt could
 not resist human longings and regrets, though he gained
 incalculable strength from these two graves on the windy
 slope. It was not for any man to understand to the
 uttermost the meaning of life.</p><br>
 <hr>

 <p class="MsoNormal">When he left he made his way across
 some of the fallow land and some of the stubble fields that
 had yielded, alas! so futilely, such abundant harvest. His
 boyhood days came back to him, when he used to crush down
 the stubble with his bare feet. Every rod of the way
 revealed some memory. He went into the barn and climbed
 into the huge, airy loft. It smelled of straw and years of
 dust and mice. The swallows darted in and out, twittering.
 How friendly they were! Year after year they had returned
 to their nests?the young birds returning to the homes
 of the old. Home even for birds was a thing of first and
 vital importance.
