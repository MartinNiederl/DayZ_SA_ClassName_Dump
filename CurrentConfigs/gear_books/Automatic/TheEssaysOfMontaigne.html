 <h2>
 PREFACE
 </h2>
 <p>
 The present publication is intended to supply a recognised deficiency in
 our literature?a library edition of the Essays of Montaigne. This
 great French writer deserves to be regarded as a classic, not only in the
 land of his birth, but in all countries and in all literatures. His
 Essays, which are at once the most celebrated and the most permanent of
 his productions, form a magazine out of which such minds as those of Bacon
 and Shakespeare did not disdain to help themselves; and, indeed, as Hallam
 observes, the Frenchman's literary importance largely results from the
 share which his mind had in influencing other minds, coeval and
 subsequent. But, at the same time, estimating the value and rank of the
 essayist, we are not to leave out of the account the drawbacks and the
 circumstances of the period: the imperfect state of education, the
 comparative scarcity of books, and the limited opportunities of
 intellectual intercourse. Montaigne freely borrowed of others, and he has
 found men willing to borrow of him as freely. We need not wonder at the
 reputation which he with seeming facility achieved. He was, without being
 aware of it, the leader of a new school in letters and morals. His book
 was different from all others which were at that date in the world. It
 diverted the ancient currents of thought into new channels. It told its
 readers, with unexampled frankness, what its writer's opinion was about
 men and things, and threw what must have been a strange kind of new light
 on many matters but darkly understood. Above all, the essayist uncased
 himself, and made his intellectual and physical organism public property.
 He took the world into his confidence on all subjects. His essays were a
 sort of literary anatomy, where we get a diagnosis of the writer's mind,
 made by himself at different levels and under a large variety of operating
 influences.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of all egotists, Montaigne, if not the greatest, was the most fascinating,
 because, perhaps, he was the least affected and most truthful. What he
 did, and what he had professed to do, was to dissect his mind, and show
 us, as best he could, how it was made, and what relation it bore to
 external objects. He investigated his mental structure as a schoolboy
 pulls his watch to pieces, to examine the mechanism of the works; and the
 result, accompanied by illustrations abounding with originality and force,
 he delivered to his fellow-men in a book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eloquence, rhetorical effect, poetry, were alike remote from his design.
 He did not write from necessity, scarcely perhaps for fame. But he desired
 to leave France, nay, and the world, something to be remembered by,
 something which should tell what kind of a man he was?what he felt,
 thought, suffered?and he succeeded immeasurably, I apprehend, beyond
 his expectations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was reasonable enough that Montaigne should expect for his work a
 certain share of celebrity in Gascony, and even, as time went on,
 throughout France; but it is scarcely probable that he foresaw how his
 renown was to become world-wide; how he was to occupy an almost unique
 position as a man of letters and a moralist; how the Essays would be read,
 in all the principal languages of Europe, by millions of intelligent human
 beings, who never heard of Perigord or the League, and who are in doubt,
 if they are questioned, whether the author lived in the sixteenth or the
 eighteenth century. This is true fame. A man of genius belongs to no
 period and no country. He speaks the language of nature, which is always
 everywhere the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The text of these volumes is taken from the first edition of Cotton's
 version, printed in 3 vols. 8vo, 1685-6, and republished in 1693, 1700,
 1711, 1738, and 1743, in the same number of volumes and the same size. In
 the earliest impression the errors of the press are corrected merely as
 far as page 240 of the first volume, and all the editions follow one
 another. That of 1685-6 was the only one which the translator lived to
 see. He died in 1687, leaving behind him an interesting and little-known
 collection of poems, which appeared posthumously, 8vo, 1689.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was considered imperative to correct Cotton's translation by a careful
 collation with the 'variorum' edition of the original, Paris, 1854, 4
 vols. 8vo or 12mo, and parallel passages from Florin's earlier undertaking
 have occasionally been inserted at the foot of the page. A Life of the
 Author and all his recovered Letters, sixteen in number, have also been
 given; but, as regards the correspondence, it can scarcely be doubted that
 it is in a purely fragmentary state. To do more than furnish a sketch of
 the leading incidents in Montaigne's life seemed, in the presence of Bayle
 St. John's charming and able biography, an attempt as difficult as it was
 useless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The besetting sin of both Montaigne's translators seems to have been a
 propensity for reducing his language and phraseology to the language and
 phraseology of the age and country to which they belonged, and, moreover,
 inserting paragraphs and words, not here and there only, but constantly
 and habitually, from an evident desire and view to elucidate or strengthen
 their author's meaning. The result has generally been unfortunate; and I
 have, in the case of all these interpolations on Cotton's part, felt
 bound, where I did not cancel them, to throw them down into the notes, not
 thinking it right that Montaigne should be allowed any longer to stand
 sponsor for what he never wrote; and reluctant, on the other hand, to
 suppress the intruding matter entirely, where it appeared to possess a
 value of its own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nor is redundancy or paraphrase the only form of transgression in Cotton,
 for there are places in his author which he thought proper to omit, and it
 is hardly necessary to say that the restoration of all such matter to the
 text was considered essential to its integrity and completeness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My warmest thanks are due to my father, Mr Registrar Hazlitt, the author
 of the well-known and excellent edition of Montaigne published in 1842,
 for the important assistance which he has rendered to me in verifying and
 retranslating the quotations, which were in a most corrupt state, and of
 which Cotton's English versions were singularly loose and inexact, and for
 the zeal with which he has co-operated with me in collating the English
 text, line for line and word for word, with the best French edition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the favour of Mr F. W. Cosens, I have had by me, while at work on this
 subject, the copy of Cotgrave's Dictionary, folio, 1650, which belonged to
 Cotton. It has his autograph and copious MSS. notes, nor is it too much to
 presume that it is the very book employed by him in his translation.

 <h2>
 THE LIFE OF MONTAIGNE
 </h2>
 <p>
 [This is translated freely from that prefixed to the 'variorum' Paris
 edition, 1854, 4 vols. 8vo. This biography is the more desirable that it
 contains all really interesting and important matter in the journal of the
 Tour in Germany and Italy, which, as it was merely written under
 Montaigne's dictation, is in the third person, is scarcely worth
 publication, as a whole, in an English dress.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The author of the Essays was born, as he informs us himself, between
 eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, the last of February 1533, at the
 chateau of St. Michel de Montaigne. His father, Pierre Eyquem, esquire,
 was successively first Jurat of the town of Bordeaux (1530), Under-Mayor
 1536, Jurat for the second time in 1540, Procureur in 1546, and at length
 Mayor from 1553 to 1556. He was a man of austere probity, who had "a
 particular regard for honour and for propriety in his person and attire .
 . . a mighty good faith in his speech, and a conscience and a religious
 feeling inclining to superstition, rather than to the other
 extreme."[Essays, ii. 2.] Pierre Eyquem bestowed great care on the
 education of his children, especially on the practical side of it. To
 associate closely his son Michel with the people, and attach him to those
 who stand in need of assistance, he caused him to be held at the font by
 persons of meanest position; subsequently he put him out to nurse with a
 poor villager, and then, at a later period, made him accustom himself to
 the most common sort of living, taking care, nevertheless, to cultivate
 his mind, and superintend its development without the exercise of undue
 rigour or constraint. Michel, who gives us the minutest account of his
 earliest years, charmingly narrates how they used to awake him by the
 sound of some agreeable music, and how he learned Latin, without suffering
 the rod or shedding a tear, before beginning French, thanks to the German
 teacher whom his father had placed near him, and who never addressed him
 except in the language of Virgil and Cicero. The study of Greek took
 precedence. At six years of age young Montaigne went to the College of
 Guienne at Bordeaux, where he had as preceptors the most eminent scholars
 of the sixteenth century, Nicolas Grouchy, Guerente, Muret, and Buchanan.
 At thirteen he had passed through all the classes, and as he was destined
 for the law he left school to study that science. He was then about
 fourteen, but these early years of his life are involved in obscurity. The
 next information that we have is that in 1554 he received the appointment
 of councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux; in 1559 he was at Bar-le-Duc
 with the court of Francis II, and in the year following he was present at
 Rouen to witness the declaration of the majority of Charles IX. We do not
 know in what manner he was engaged on these occasions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Between 1556 and 1563 an important incident occurred in the life of
 Montaigne, in the commencement of his romantic friendship with Etienne de
 la Boetie, whom he had met, as he tells us, by pure chance at some festive
 celebration in the town. From their very first interview the two found
 themselves drawn irresistibly close to one another, and during six years
 this alliance was foremost in the heart of Montaigne, as it was afterwards
 in his memory, when death had severed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Although he blames severely in his own book [Essays, i. 27.] those who,
 contrary to the opinion of Aristotle, marry before five-and-thirty,
 Montaigne did not wait for the period fixed by the philosopher of Stagyra,
 but in 1566, in his thirty-third year, he espoused Francoise de
 Chassaigne, daughter of a councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux. The
 history of his early married life vies in obscurity with that of his
 youth. His biographers are not agreed among themselves; and in the same
 degree that he lays open to our view all that concerns his secret
 thoughts, the innermost mechanism of his mind, he observes too much
 reticence in respect to his public functions and conduct, and his social
 relations. The title of Gentleman in Ordinary to the King, which he
 assumes, in a preface, and which Henry II. gives him in a letter, which we
 print a little farther on; what he says as to the commotions of courts,
 where he passed a portion of his life; the Instructions which he wrote
 under the dictation of Catherine de Medici for King Charles IX., and his
 noble correspondence with Henry IV., leave no doubt, however, as to the
 part which he played in the transactions of those times, and we find an
 unanswerable proof of the esteem in which he was held by the most exalted
 personages, in a letter which was addressed to him by Charles at the time
 he was admitted to the Order of St. Michael, which was, as he informs us
 himself, the highest honour of the French noblesse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 According to Lacroix du Maine, Montaigne, upon the death of his eldest
 brother, resigned his post of Councillor, in order to adopt the military
 profession, while, if we might credit the President Bouhier, he never
 discharged any functions connected with arms. However, several passages in
 the Essays seem to indicate that he not only took service, but that he was
 actually in numerous campaigns with the Catholic armies. Let us add, that
 on his monument he is represented in a coat of mail, with his casque and
 gauntlets on his right side, and a lion at his feet, all which signifies,
 in the language of funeral emblems, that the departed has been engaged in
 some important military transactions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However it may be as to these conjectures, our author, having arrived at
 his thirty-eighth year, resolved to dedicate to study and contemplation
 the remaining term of his life; and on his birthday, the last of February
 1571, he caused a philosophical inscription, in Latin, to be placed upon
 one of the walls of his chateau, where it is still to be seen, and of
 which the translation is to this effect:?"In the year of Christ . .
 . in his thirty-eighth year, on the eve of the Calends of March, his
 birthday, Michel Montaigne, already weary of court employments and public
 honours, withdrew himself entirely into the converse of the learned
 virgins where he intends to spend the remaining moiety of the to allotted
 to him in tranquil seclusion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the time to which we have come, Montaigne was unknown to the world of
 letters, except as a translator and editor. In 1569 he had published a
 translation of the "Natural Theology" of Raymond de Sebonde, which he had
 solely undertaken to please his father. In 1571 he had caused to be
 printed at Paris certain 'opuscucla' of Etienne de la Boetie; and these
 two efforts, inspired in one case by filial duty, and in the other by
 friendship, prove that affectionate motives overruled with him mere
 personal ambition as a literary man. We may suppose that he began to
 compose the Essays at the very outset of his retirement from public
 engagements; for as, according to his own account, observes the President
 Bouhier, he cared neither for the chase, nor building, nor gardening, nor
 agricultural pursuits, and was exclusively occupied with reading and
 reflection, he devoted himself with satisfaction to the task of setting
 down his thoughts just as they occurred to him. Those thoughts became a
 book, and the first part of that book, which was to confer immortality on
 the writer, appeared at Bordeaux in 1580. Montaigne was then fifty-seven;
 he had suffered for some years past from renal colic and gravel; and it
 was with the necessity of distraction from his pain, and the hope of
 deriving relief from the waters, that he undertook at this time a great
 journey. As the account which he has left of his travels in Germany and
 Italy comprises some highly interesting particulars of his life and
 personal history, it seems worth while to furnish a sketch or analysis of
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Journey, of which we proceed to describe the course simply," says the
 editor of the Itinerary, "had, from Beaumont-sur-Oise to Plombieres, in
 Lorraine, nothing sufficiently interesting to detain us . . . we must go
 as far, as Basle, of which we have a description, acquainting us with its
 physical and political condition at that period, as well as with the
 character of its baths. The passage of Montaigne through Switzerland is
 not without interest, as we see there how our philosophical traveller
 accommodated himself everywhere to the ways of the country. The hotels,
 the provisions, the Swiss cookery, everything, was agreeable to him; it
 appears, indeed, as if he preferred to the French manners and tastes those
 of the places he was visiting, and of which the simplicity and freedom (or
 frankness) accorded more with his own mode of life and thinking. In the
 towns where he stayed, Montaigne took care to see the Protestant divines,
 to make himself conversant with all their dogmas. He even had disputations
 with them occasionally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Having left Switzerland he went to Isne, an imperial then on to Augsburg
 and Munich. He afterwards proceeded to the Tyrol, where he was agreeably
 surprised, after the warnings which he had received, at the very slight
 inconveniences which he suffered, which gave him occasion to remark that
 he had all his life distrusted the statements of others respecting foreign
 countries, each person's tastes being according to the notions of his
 native place; and that he had consequently set very little on what he was
 told beforehand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Upon his arrival at Botzen, Montaigne wrote to Francois Hottmann, to say
 that he had been so pleased with his visit to Germany that he quitted it
 with great regret, although it was to go into Italy. He then passed
 through Brunsol, Trent, where he put up at the Rose; thence going to
 Rovera; and here he first lamented the scarcity of crawfish, but made up
 for the loss by partaking of truffles cooked in oil and vinegar; oranges,
 citrons, and olives, in all of which he delighted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After passing a restless night, when he bethought himself in the morning
 that there was some new town or district to be seen, he rose, we are told,
 with alacrity and pleasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His secretary, to whom he dictated his Journal, assures us that he never
 saw him take so much interest in surrounding scenes and persons, and
 believes that the complete change helped to mitigate his sufferings in
 concentrating his attention on other points. When there was a complaint
 made that he had led his party out of the beaten route, and then returned
 very near the spot from which they started, his answer was that he had no
 settled course, and that he merely proposed to himself to pay visits to
 places which he had not seen, and so long as they could not convict him of
 traversing the same path twice, or revisiting a point already seen, he
 could perceive no harm in his plan. As to Rome, he cared less to go there,
 inasmuch as everybody went there; and he said that he never had a lacquey
 who could not tell him all about Florence or Ferrara. He also would say
 that he seemed to himself like those who are reading some pleasant story
 or some fine book, of which they fear to come to the end: he felt so much
 pleasure in travelling that he dreaded the moment of arrival at the place
 where they were to stop for the night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We see that Montaigne travelled, just as he wrote, completely at his ease,
 and without the least constraint, turning, just as he fancied, from the
 common or ordinary roads taken by tourists. The good inns, the soft beds,
 the fine views, attracted his notice at every point, and in his
 observations on men and things he confines himself chiefly to the
 practical side. The consideration of his health was constantly before him,
 and it was in consequence of this that, while at Venice, which
 disappointed him, he took occasion to note, for the benefit of readers,
 that he had an attack of colic, and that he evacuated two large stones
 after supper. On quitting Venice, he went in succession to Ferrara,
 Rovigo, Padua, Bologna (where he had a stomach-ache), Florence, &amp;c.;
 and everywhere, before alighting, he made it a rule to send some of his
 servants to ascertain where the best accommodation was to be had. He
 pronounced the Florentine women the finest in the world, but had not an
 equally good opinion of the food, which was less plentiful than in
 Germany, and not so well served. He lets us understand that in Italy they
 send up dishes without dressing, but in Germany they were much better
 seasoned, and served with a variety of sauces and gravies. He remarked
 further, that the glasses were singularly small and the wines insipid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After dining with the Grand-Duke of Florence, Montaigne passed rapidly
 over the intermediate country, which had no fascination for him, and
 arrived at Rome on the last day of November, entering by the Porta del
 Popolo, and putting up at Bear. But he afterwards hired, at twenty crowns
 a month, fine furnished rooms in the house of a Spaniard, who included in
 these terms the use of the kitchen fire. What most annoyed him in the
 Eternal City was the number of Frenchmen he met, who all saluted him in
 his native tongue; but otherwise he was very comfortable, and his stay
 extended to five months. A mind like his, full of grand classical
 reflections, could not fail to be profoundly impressed in the presence of
 the ruins at Rome, and he has enshrined in a magnificent passage of the
 Journal the feelings of the moment: "He said," writes his secretary, "that
 at Rome one saw nothing but the sky under which she had been built, and
 the outline of her site: that the knowledge we had of her was abstract,
 contemplative, not palpable to the actual senses: that those who said they
 beheld at least the ruins of Rome, went too far, for the ruins of so
 gigantic a structure must have commanded greater reverence-it was nothing
 but her sepulchre. The world, jealous of her, prolonged empire, had in the
 first place broken to pieces that admirable body, and then, when they
 perceived that the remains attracted worship and awe, had buried the very
 wreck itself.?[Compare a passage in one of Horace Walpole's letters
 to Richard West, 22 March 1740 (Cunningham's edit. i. 41), where Walpole,
 speaking of Rome, describes her very ruins as ruined.]?As to those
 small fragments which were still to be seen on the surface,
 notwithstanding the assaults of time and all other attacks, again and
 again repeated, they had been favoured by fortune to be some slight
 evidence of that infinite grandeur which nothing could entirely extingish.
 But it was likely that these disfigured remains were the least entitled to
 attention, and that the enemies of that immortal renown, in their fury,
 had addressed themselves in the first instance to the destruction of what
 was most beautiful and worthiest of preservation; and that the buildings
 of this bastard Rome, raised upon the ancient productions, although they
 might excite the admiration of the present age, reminded him of the crows'
 and sparrows' nests built in the walls and arches of the old churches,
 destroyed by the Huguenots. Again, he was apprehensive, seeing the space
 which this grave occupied, that the whole might not have been recovered,
 and that the burial itself had been buried. And, moreover, to see a
 wretched heap of rubbish, as pieces of tile and pottery, grow (as it had
 ages since) to a height equal to that of Mount Gurson,?[In Perigord.]?and
 thrice the width of it, appeared to show a conspiracy of destiny against
 the glory and pre-eminence of that city, affording at the same time a
 novel and extraordinary proof of its departed greatness. He (Montaigne)
 observed that it was difficult to believe considering the limited area
 taken up by any of her seven hills and particularly the two most favoured
 ones, the Capitoline and the Palatine, that so many buildings stood on the
 site. Judging only from what is left of the Temple of Concord, along the
 'Forum Romanum', of which the fall seems quite recent, like that of some
 huge mountain split into horrible crags, it does not look as if more than
 two such edifices could have found room on the Capitoline, on which there
 were at one period from five-and-twenty to thirty temples, besides private
 dwellings. But, in point of fact, there is scarcely any probability of the
 views which we take of the city being correct, its plan and form having
 changed infinitely; for instance, the 'Velabrum', which on account of its
 depressed level, received the sewage of the city, and had a lake, has been
 raised by artificial accumulation to a height with the other hills, and
 Mount Savello has, in truth, grown simply out of the ruins of the theatre
 of Marcellus. He believed that an ancient Roman would not recognise the
 place again. It often happened that in digging down into earth the workmen
 came upon the crown of some lofty column, which, though thus buried, was
 still standing upright. The people there have no recourse to other
 foundations than the vaults and arches of the old houses, upon which, as
 on slabs of rock, they raise their modern palaces. It is easy to see that
 several of the ancient streets are thirty feet below those at present in
 use."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sceptical as Montaigne shows himself in his books, yet during his sojourn
 at Rome he manifested a great regard for religion. He solicited the honour
 of being admitted to kiss the feet of the Holy Father, Gregory XIII.; and
 the Pontiff exhorted him always to continue in the devotion which he had
 hitherto exhibited to the Church and the service of the Most Christian
 King.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After this, one sees," says the editor of the Journal, "Montaigne
 employing all his time in making excursions bout the neighbourhood on
 horseback or on foot, in visits, in observations of every kind. The
 churches, the stations, the processions even, the sermons; then the
 palaces, the vineyards, the gardens, the public amusements, as the
 Carnival, &amp;c.?nothing was overlooked. He saw a Jewish child
 circumcised, and wrote down a most minute account of the operation. He met
 at San Sisto a Muscovite ambassador, the second who had come to Rome since
 the pontificate of Paul III. This minister had despatches from his court
 for Venice, addressed to the 'Grand Governor of the Signory'. The court of
 Muscovy had at that time such limited relations with the other powers of
 Europe, and it was so imperfect in its information, that it thought Venice
 to be a dependency of the Holy See."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of all the particulars with which he has furnished us during his stay at
 Rome, the following passage in reference to the Essays is not the least
 singular: "The Master of the Sacred Palace returned him his Essays,
 castigated in accordance with the views of the learned monks. 'He had only
 been able to form a judgment of them,' said he, 'through a certain French
 monk, not understanding French himself'"?we leave Montaigne himself
 to tell the story?"and he received so complacently my excuses and
 explanations on each of the passages which had been animadverted upon by
 the French monk, that he concluded by leaving me at liberty to revise the
 text agreeably to the dictates of my own conscience. I begged him, on the
 contrary, to abide by the opinion of the person who had criticised me,
 confessing, among other matters, as, for example, in my use of the word
 fortune, in quoting historical poets, in my apology for Julian, in my
 animadversion on the theory that he who prayed ought to be exempt from
 vicious inclinations for the time being; item, in my estimate of cruelty,
 as something beyond simple death; item, in my view that a child ought to
 be brought up to do everything, and so on; that these were my opinions,
 which I did not think wrong; as to other things, I said that the corrector
 understood not my meaning. The Master, who is a clever man, made many
 excuses for me, and gave me to suppose that he did not concur in the
 suggested improvements; and pleaded very ingeniously for me in my presence
 against another (also an Italian) who opposed my sentiments."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such is what passed between Montaigne and these two personages at that
 time; but when the Essayist was leaving, and went to bid them farewell,
 they used very different language to him. "They prayed me," says he, "to
 pay no attention to the censure passed on my book, in which other French
 persons had apprised them that there were many foolish things; adding,
 that they honoured my affectionate intention towards the Church, and my
 capacity; and had so high an opinion of my candour and conscientiousness
 that they should leave it to me to make such alterations as were proper in
 the book, when I reprinted it; among other things, the word fortune. To
 excuse themselves for what they had said against my book, they instanced
 works of our time by cardinals and other divines of excellent repute which
 had been blamed for similar faults, which in no way affected reputation of
 the author, or of the publication as a whole; they requested me to lend
 the Church the support of my eloquence (this was their fair speech), and
 to make longer stay in the place, where I should be free from all further
 intrusion on their part. It seemed to me that we parted very good
 friends."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before quitting Rome, Montaigne received his diploma of citizenship, by
 which he was greatly flattered; and after a visit to Tivoli he set out for
 Loretto, stopping at Ancona, Fano, and Urbino. He arrived at the beginning
 of May 1581, at Bagno della Villa, where he established himself, order to
 try the waters. There, we find in the Journal, of his own accord the
 Essayist lived in the strictest conformity with the regime, and henceforth
 we only hear of diet, the effect which the waters had by degrees upon
 system, of the manner in which he took them; in a word, he does not omit
 an item of the circumstances connected with his daily routine, his habit
 of body, his baths, and the rest. It was no longer the journal of a
 traveller which he kept, but the diary of an invalid,?["I am reading
 Montaigne's Travels, which have lately been found; there is little in them
 but the baths and medicines he took, and what he had everywhere for
 dinner."?H. Walpole to Sir Horace Mann, June 8, 1774.]?attentive
 to the minutest details of the cure which he was endeavouring to
 accomplish: a sort of memorandum book, in which he was noting down
 everything that he felt and did, for the benefit of his medical man at
 home, who would have the care of his health on his return, and the
 attendance on his subsequent infirmities. Montaigne gives it as his reason
 and justification for enlarging to this extent here, that he had omitted,
 to his regret, to do so in his visits to other baths, which might have
 saved him the trouble of writing at such great length now; but it is
 perhaps a better reason in our eyes, that what he wrote he wrote for his
 own use.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We find in these accounts, however, many touches which are valuable as
 illustrating the manners of the place. The greater part of the entries in
 the Journal, giving the account of these waters, and of the travels, down
 to Montaigne's arrival at the first French town on his homeward route, are
 in Italian, because he wished to exercise himself in that language.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The minute and constant watchfulness of Montaigne over his health and over
 himself might lead one to suspect that excessive fear of death which
 degenerates into cowardice. But was it not rather the fear of the
 operation for the stone, at that time really formidable? Or perhaps he was
 of the same way of thinking with the Greek poet, of whom Cicero reports
 this saying: "I do not desire to die; but the thought of being dead is
 indifferent to me." Let us hear, however, what he says himself on this
 point very frankly: "It would be too weak and unmanly on my part if,
 certain as I am of always finding myself in the position of having to
 succumb in that way,?[To the stone or gravel.]?and death
 coming nearer and nearer to me, I did not make some effort, before the
 time came, to bear the trial with fortitude. For reason prescribes that we
 should joyfully accept what it may please God to send us. Therefore the
 only remedy, the only rule, and the sole doctrine for avoiding the evils
 by which mankind is surrounded, whatever they are, is to resolve to bear
 them so far as our nature permits, or to put an end to them courageously
 and promptly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was still at the waters of La Villa, when, on the 7th September 1581,
 he learned by letter that he had been elected Mayor of Bordeaux on the 1st
 August preceding. This intelligence made him hasten his departure; and
 from Lucca he proceeded to Rome. He again made some stay in that city, and
 he there received the letter of the jurats of Bordeaux, notifying to him
 officially his election to the Mayoralty, and inviting him to return as
 speedily as possible. He left for France, accompanied by young D'Estissac
 and several other gentlemen, who escorted him a considerable distance; but
 none went back to France with him, not even his travelling companion. He
 passed by Padua, Milan, Mont Cenis, and Chambery; thence he went on to
 Lyons, and lost no time in repairing to his chateau, after an absence of
 seventeen months and eight days.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We have just seen that, during his absence in Italy, the author of the
 Essays was elected mayor of Bordeaux. "The gentlemen of Bordeaux," says
 he, "elected me Mayor of their town while I was at a distance from France,
 and far from the thought of such a thing. I excused myself; but they gave
 to understand that I was wrong in so doing, it being also the command of
 the king that I should stand." This the letter which Henry III. wrote to
 him on the occasion:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MONSIEUR, DE MONTAIGNE,?Inasmuch as I hold in great esteem your
 fidelity and zealous devotion to my service, it has been a pleasure to me
 to learn that you have been chosen mayor of my town of Bordeaux. I have
 had the agreeable duty of confirming the selection, and I did so the more
 willingly, seeing that it was made during your distant absence; wherefore
 it is my desire, and I require and command you expressly that you proceed
 without delay to enter on the duties to which you have received so
 legitimate a call. And so you will act in a manner very agreeable to me,
 while the contrary will displease me greatly. Praying God, M. de
 Montaigne, to have you in his holy keeping.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Written at Paris, the 25th day of November 1581.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "HENRI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A Monsieur de MONTAIGNE, Knight of my Order, Gentleman in Ordinary of my
 Chamber, being at present in Rome."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Montaigne, in his new employment, the most important in the province,
 obeyed the axiom, that a man may not refuse a duty, though it absorb his
 time and attention, and even involve the sacrifice of his blood. Placed
 between two extreme parties, ever on the point of getting to blows, he
 showed himself in practice what he is in his book, the friend of a middle
 and temperate policy. Tolerant by character and on principle, he belonged,
 like all the great minds of the sixteenth century, to that political sect
 which sought to improve, without destroying, institutions; and we may say
 of him, what he himself said of La Boetie, "that he had that maxim
 indelibly impressed on his mind, to obey and submit himself religiously to
 the laws under which he was born. Affectionately attached to the repose of
 his country, an enemy to changes and innovations, he would have preferred
 to employ what means he had towards their discouragement and suppression,
 than in promoting their success." Such was the platform of his
 administration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He applied himself, in an especial manner, to the maintenance of peace
 between the two religious factions which at that time divided the town of
 Bordeaux; and at the end of his two first years of office, his grateful
 fellow-citizens conferred on him (in 1583) the mayoralty for two years
 more, a distinction which had been enjoyed, as he tells us, only twice
 before. On the expiration of his official career, after four years'
 duration, he could say fairly enough of himself that he left behind him
 neither hatred nor cause of offence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the midst of the cares of government, Montaigne found time to revise
 and enlarge his Essays, which, since their appearance in 1580, were
 continually receiving augmentation in the form of additional chapters or
 papers. Two more editions were printed in 1582 and 1587; and during this
 time the author, while making alterations in the original text, had
 composed part of the Third Book. He went to Paris to make arrangements for
 the publication of his enlarged labours, and a fourth impression in 1588
 was the result. He remained in the capital some time on this occasion, and
 it was now that he met for the first time Mademoiselle de Gournay. Gifted
 with an active and inquiring spirit, and, above all, possessing a sound
 and healthy tone of mind, Mademoiselle de Gournay had been carried from
 her childhood with that tide which set in with sixteenth century towards
 controversy, learning, and knowledge. She learnt Latin without a master;
 and when, the age of eighteen, she accidentally became possessor of a copy
 of the Essays, she was transported with delight and admiration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She quitted the chateau of Gournay, to come and see him. We cannot do
 better, in connection with this journey of sympathy, than to repeat the
 words of Pasquier: "That young lady, allied to several great and noble
 families of Paris, proposed to herself no other marriage than with her
 honour, enriched with the knowledge gained from good books, and, beyond
 all others, from the essays of M. de Montaigne, who making in the year
 1588 a lengthened stay in the town of Paris, she went there for the
 purpose of forming his personal acquaintance; and her mother, Madame de
 Gournay, and herself took him back with them to their chateau, where, at
 two or three different times, he spent three months altogether, most
 welcome of visitors." It was from this moment that Mademoiselle de Gournay
 dated her adoption as Montaigne's daughter, a circumstance which has
 tended to confer immortality upon her in a far greater measure than her
 own literary productions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Montaigne, on leaving Paris, stayed a short time at Blois, to attend the
 meeting of the States-General. We do not know what part he took in that
 assembly: but it is known that he was commissioned, about this period, to
 negotiate between Henry of Navarre (afterwards Henry IV.) and the Duke of
 Guise. His political life is almost a blank; but De Thou assures us that
 Montaigne enjoyed the confidence of the principal persons of his time. De
 Thou, who calls him a frank man without constraint, tells us that, walking
 with him and Pasquier in the court at the Castle of Blois, he heard him
 pronounce some very remarkable opinions on contemporary events, and he
 adds that Montaigne had foreseen that the troubles in France could not end
 without witnessing the death of either the King of Navarre or of the Duke
 of Guise. He had made himself so completely master of the views of these
 two princes, that he told De Thou that the King of Navarre would have been
 prepared to embrace Catholicism, if he had not been afraid of being
 abandoned by his party, and that the Duke of Guise, on his part, had no
 particular repugnance to the Confession of Augsburg, for which the
 Cardinal of Lorraine, his uncle, had inspired him with a liking, if it had
 not been for the peril involved in quitting the Romish communion. It would
 have been easy for Montaigne to play, as we call it, a great part in
 politics, and create for himself a lofty position but his motto was, 'Otio
 et Libertati'; and he returned quietly home to compose a chapter for his
 next edition on inconveniences of Greatness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The author of the Essays was now fifty-five. The malady which tormented
 him grew only worse and worse with years; and yet he occupied himself
 continually with reading, meditating, and composition. He employed the
 years 1589, 1590, and 1591 in making fresh additions to his book; and even
 in the approaches of old age he might fairly anticipate many happy hours,
 when he was attacked by quinsy, depriving him of the power utterance.
 Pasquier, who has left us some details his last hours, narrates that he
 remained three days in full possession of his faculties, but unable to
 speak, so that, in order to make known his desires, he was obliged to
 resort to writing; and as he felt his end drawing near, he begged his wife
 to summon certain of the gentlemen who lived in the neighbourhood to bid
 them a last farewell. When they had arrived, he caused mass to be
 celebrated in apartment; and just as the priest was elevating the host,
 Montaigne fell forward with his arms extended in front of him, on the bed,
 and so expired. He was in his sixtieth year. It was the 13th September
 1592.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Montaigne was buried near his own house; but a few years after his
 decease, his remains were removed to the church of a Commandery of St.
 Antoine at Bordeaux, where they still continue. His monument was restored
 in 1803 by a descendant. It was seen about 1858 by an English traveller
 (Mr. St. John).'?["Montaigne the Essayist," by Bayle St. John, 1858,
 2 vols. 8vo, is one of most delightful books of the kind.]? and was
 then in good preservation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In 1595 Mademoiselle de Gournay published a new edition of Montaigne's
 Essays, and the first with the latest emendations of the author, from a
 copy presented to her by his widow, and which has not been recovered,
 although it is known to have been in existence some years after the date
 of the impression, made on its authority.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Coldly as Montaigne's literary productions appear to have been received by
 the generation immediately succeeding his own age, his genius grew into
 just appreciation in the seventeenth century, when such great spirits
 arose as La Bruyere, Moliere, La Fontaine, Madame de Sevigne. "O,"
 exclaimed the Chatelaine des Rochers, "what capital company he is, the
 dear man! he is my old friend; and just for the reason that he is so, he
 always seems new. My God! how full is that book of sense!" Balzac said
 that he had carried human reason as far and as high as it could go, both
 in politics and in morals. On the other hand, Malebranche and the writers
 of Port Royal were against him; some reprehended the licentiousness of his
 writings; others their impiety, materialism, epicureanism. Even Pascal,
 who had carefully read the Essays, and gained no small profit by them, did
 not spare his reproaches. But Montaigne has outlived detraction. As time
 has gone on, his admirers and borrowers have increased in number, and his
 Jansenism, which recommended him to the eighteenth century, may not be his
 least recommendation in the nineteenth. Here we have certainly, on the
 whole, a first-class man, and one proof of his masterly genius seems to
 be, that his merits and his beauties are sufficient to induce us to leave
 out of consideration blemishes and faults which would have been fatal to
 an inferior writer.

 I.??To Monsieur de MONTAIGNE
 </h2>
 <p>
 [This account of the death of La Boetie begins imperfectly. It first
 appeared in a little volume of Miscellanies in 1571. See Hazlitt, ubi sup.
 p. 630.]?As to his last words, doubtless, if any man can give good
 account of them, it is I, both because, during the whole of his sickness
 he conversed as fully with me as with any one, and also because, in
 consequence of the singular and brotherly friendship which we had
 entertained for each other, I was perfectly acquainted with the
 intentions, opinions, and wishes which he had formed in the course of his
 life, as much so, certainly, as one man can possibly be with those of
 another man; and because I knew them to be elevated, virtuous, full of
 steady resolution, and (after all said) admirable. I well foresaw that, if
 his illness permitted him to express himself, he would allow nothing to
 fall from him, in such an extremity, that was not replete with good
 example. I consequently took every care in my power to treasure what was
 said. True it is, Monseigneur, as my memory is not only in itself very
 short, but in this case affected by the trouble which I have undergone,
 through so heavy and important a loss, that I have forgotten a number of
 things which I should wish to have had known; but those which I recollect
 shall be related to you as exactly as lies in my power. For to represent
 in full measure his noble career suddenly arrested, to paint to you his
 indomitable courage, in a body worn out and prostrated by pain and the
 assaults of death, I confess, would demand a far better ability than mine:
 because, although, when in former years he discoursed on serious and
 important matters, he handled them in such a manner that it was difficult
 to reproduce exactly what he said, yet his ideas and his words at the last
 seemed to rival each other in serving him. For I am sure that I never knew
 him give birth to such fine conceptions, or display so much eloquence, as
 in the time of his sickness. If, Monseigneur, you blame me for introducing
 his more ordinary observations, please to know that I do so advisedly; for
 since they proceeded from him at a season of such great trouble, they
 indicate the perfect tranquillity of his mind and thoughts to the last.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Monday, the 9th day of August 1563, on my return from the Court, I sent
 an invitation to him to come and dine with me. He returned word that he
 was obliged, but, being indisposed, he would thank me to do him the
 pleasure of spending an hour with him before he started for Medoc. Shortly
 after my dinner I went to him. He had laid himself down on the bed with
 his clothes on, and he was already, I perceived, much changed. He
 complained of diarrhoea, accompanied by the gripes, and said that he had
 it about him ever since he played with M. d'Escars with nothing but his
 doublet on, and that with him a cold often brought on such attacks. I
 advised him to go as he had proposed, but to stay for the night at
 Germignac, which is only about two leagues from the town. I gave him this
 advice, because some houses, near to that where he was ping, were visited
 by the plague, about which he was nervous since his return from Perigord
 and the Agenois, here it had been raging; and, besides, horse exercise
 was, from my own experience, beneficial under similar circumstances. He
 set out, accordingly, with his wife and M. Bouillhonnas, his uncle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Early on the following morning, however, I had intelligence from Madame de
 la Boetie, that in the night he had fresh and violent attack of dysentery.
 She had called in physician and apothecary, and prayed me to lose no time
 coming, which (after dinner) I did. He was delighted to see me; and when I
 was going away, under promise to turn the following day, he begged me more
 importunately and affectionately than he was wont to do, to give him as
 such of my company as possible. I was a little affected; yet was about to
 leave, when Madame de la Boetie, as if she foresaw something about to
 happen, implored me with tears to stay the night. When I consented, he
 seemed to grow more cheerful. I returned home the next day, and on the
 Thursday I paid him another visit. He had become worse; and his loss of
 blood from the dysentery, which reduced his strength very much, was
 largely on the increase. I quitted his side on Friday, but on Saturday I
 went to him, and found him very weak. He then gave me to understand that
 his complaint was infectious, and, moreover, disagreeable and depressing;
 and that he, knowing thoroughly my constitution, desired that I should
 content myself with coming to see him now and then. On the contrary, after
 that I never left his side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was only on the Sunday that he began to converse with me on any subject
 beyond the immediate one of his illness, and what the ancient doctors
 thought of it: we had not touched on public affairs, for I found at the
 very outset that he had a dislike to them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, on the Sunday, he had a fainting fit; and when he came to himself, he
 told me that everything seemed to him confused, as if in a mist and in
 disorder, and that, nevertheless, this visitation was not unpleasing to
 him. "Death," I replied, "has no worse sensation, my brother." "None so
 bad," was his answer. He had had no regular sleep since the beginning of
 his illness; and as he became worse and worse, he began to turn his
 attention to questions which men commonly occupy themselves with in the
 last extremity, despairing now of getting better, and intimating as much
 to me. On that day, as he appeared in tolerably good spirits, I took
 occasion to say to him that, in consideration of the singular love I bore
 him, it would become me to take care that his affairs, which he had
 conducted with such rare prudence in his life, should not be neglected at
 present; and that I should regret it if, from want of proper counsel, he
 should leave anything unsettled, not only on account of the loss to his
 family, but also to his good name.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He thanked me for my kindness; and after a little reflection, as if he was
 resolving certain doubts in his own mind, he desired me to summon his
 uncle and his wife by themselves, in order that he might acquaint them
 with his testamentary dispositions. I told him that this would shock them.
 "No, no," he answered, "I will cheer them by making out my case to be
 better than it is." And then he inquired, whether we were not all much
 taken by surprise at his having fainted? I replied, that it was of no
 importance, being incidental to the complaint from which he suffered.
 "True, my brother," said he; "it would be unimportant, even though it
 should lead to what you most dread." "For you," I rejoined, "it might be a
 happy thing; but I should be the loser, who would thereby be deprived of
 so great, so wise, and so steadfast a friend, a friend whose place I
 should never see supplied." "It is very likely you may not," was his
 answer; "and be sure that one thing which makes me somewhat anxious to
 recover, and to delay my journey to that place, whither I am already
 half-way gone, is the thought of the loss both you and that poor man and
 woman there (referring to his uncle and wife) must sustain; for I love
 them with my whole heart, and I feel certain that they will find it very
 hard to lose me. I should also regret it on account of such as have, in my
 lifetime, valued me, and whose conversation I should like to have enjoyed
 a little longer; and I beseech you, my brother, if I leave the world, to
 carry to them for me an assurance of the esteem I entertained for them to
 the last moment of my existence. My birth was, moreover, scarcely to so
 little purpose but that, had I lived, I might have done some service to
 the public; but, however this may be, I am prepared to submit to the will
 of God, when it shall please Him to call me, being confident of enjoying
 the tranquillity which you have foretold for me. As for you, my friend, I
 feel sure that you are so wise, that you will control your emotions, and
 submit to His divine ordinance regarding me; and I beg of you to see that
 that good man and woman do not mourn for my departure unnecessarily."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He proceeded to inquire how they behaved at present. "Very well," said I,
 "considering the circumstances." "Ah!" he replied, "that is, so long as
 they do not abandon all hope of me; but when that shall be the case, you
 will have a hard task to support them." It was owing to his strong regard
 for his wife and uncle that he studiously disguised from them his own
 conviction as to the certainty of his end, and he prayed me to do the
 same. When they were near him he assumed an appearance of gaiety, and
 flattered them with hopes. I then went to call them. They came, wearing as
 composed an air as possible; and when we four were together, he addressed
 us, with an untroubled countenance, as follows: "Uncle and wife, rest
 assured that no new attack of my disease, or fresh doubt that I have as to
 my recovery, has led me to take this step of communicating to you my
 intentions, for, thank God, I feel very well and hopeful; but taught by
 observation and experience the instability of all human things, and even
 of the life to which we are so much attached, and which is, nevertheless,
 a mere bubble; and knowing, moreover, that my state of health brings me
 more within the danger of death, I have thought proper to settle my
 worldly affairs, having the benefit of your advice." Then addressing
 himself more particularly to his uncle, "Good uncle," said he, "if I were
 to rehearse all the obligations under which I lie to you, I am sure that I
 never should make an end. Let me only say that, wherever I have been, and
 with whomsoever I have conversed, I have represented you as doing for me
 all that a father could do for a son; both in the care with which you
 tended my education, and in the zeal with which you pushed me forward into
 public life, so that my whole existence is a testimony of your good
 offices towards me. In short, I am indebted for all that I have to you,
 who have been to me as a parent; and therefore I have no right to part
 with anything, unless it be with your approval."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a general silence hereupon, and his uncle was prevented from
 replying by tears and sobs. At last he said that whatever he thought for
 the best would be agreeable to him; and as he intended to make him his
 heir, he was at liberty to dispose of what would be his.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he turned to his wife. "My image," said he (for so he often called
 her, there being some sort of relationship between them), "since I have
 been united to you by marriage, which is one of the most weighty and
 sacred ties imposed on us by God, for the purpose of maintaining human
 society, I have continued to love, cherish, and value you; and I know that
 you have returned my affection, for which I have no sufficient
 acknowledgment. I beg you to accept such portion of my estate as I
 bequeath to you, and be satisfied with it, though it is very inadequate to
 your desert."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Afterwards he turned to me. "My brother," he began, "for whom I have so
 entire a love, and whom I selected out of so large a number, thinking to
 revive with you that virtuous and sincere friendship which, owing to the
 degeneracy of the age, has grown to be almost unknown to us, and now
 exists only in certain vestiges of antiquity, I beg of you, as a mark of
 my affection to you, to accept my library: a slender offering, but given
 with a cordial will, and suitable to you, seeing that you are fond of
 learning. It will be a memorial of your old companion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he addressed all three of us. He blessed God that in his extremity he
 had the happiness to be surrounded by those whom he held dearest in the
 world, and he looked upon it as a fine spectacle, where four persons were
 together, so unanimous in their feelings, and loving each other for each
 other's sake. He commended us one to the other; and proceeded thus: "My
 worldly matters being arranged, I must now think of the welfare of my
 soul. I am a Christian; I am a Catholic. I have lived one, and I shall die
 one. Send for a priest; for I wish to conform to this last Christian
 obligation." He now concluded his discourse, which he had conducted with
 such a firm face and with so distinct an utterance, that whereas, when I
 first entered his room, he was feeble, inarticulate in his speech, his
 pulse low and feverish, and his features pallid, now, by a sort of
 miracle, he appeared to have rallied, and his pulse was so strong that for
 the sake of comparison, I asked him to feel mine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I felt my heart so oppressed at this moment, that I had not the power to
 make him any answer; but in the course of two or three hours, solicitous
 to keep up his courage, and, likewise, out of the tenderness which I had
 had all my life for his honour and fame, wishing a larger number of
 witnesses to his admirable fortitude, I said to him, how much I was
 ashamed to think that I lacked courage to listen to what he, so great a
 sufferer, had the courage to deliver; that down to the present time I had
 scarcely conceived that God granted us such command over human
 infirmities, and had found a difficulty in crediting the examples I had
 read in histories; but that with such evidence of the thing before my
 eyes, I gave praise to God that it had shown itself in one so excessively
 dear to me, and who loved me so entirely, and that his example would help
 me to act in a similar manner when my turn came. Interrupting me, he
 begged that it might happen so, and that the conversation which had passed
 between us might not be mere words, but might be impressed deeply on our
 minds, to be put in exercise at the first occasion; and that this was the
 real object and aim of all philosophy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He then took my hand, and continued: "Brother, friend, there are many acts
 of my life, I think, which have cost me as much difficulty as this one is
 likely to do; and, after all, I have been long prepared for it, and have
 my lesson by heart. Have I not lived long enough? I am just upon
 thirty-three. By the grace of God, my days so far have known nothing but
 health and happiness; but in the ordinary course of our unstable human
 affairs, this could not have lasted much longer; it would have become time
 for me to enter on graver avocations, and I should thus have involved
 myself in numberless vexations, and, among them, the troubles of old age,
 from which I shall now be exempt. Moreover, it is probable that hitherto
 my life has been spent more simply, and with less of evil, than if God had
 spared me, and I had survived to feel the thirst for riches and worldly
 prosperity. I am sure, for my part, that I now go to God and the place of
 the blessed." He seemed to detect in my expression some inquietude at his
 words; and he exclaimed, "What, my brother, would you make me entertain
 apprehensions? Had I any, whom would it become so much as yourself to
 remove them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The notary, who had been summoned to draw up his will, came in the
 evening, and when he had the documents prepared, I inquired of La Boetie
 if he would sign them. "Sign them," cried he; "I will do so with my own
 hand; but I could desire more time, for I feel exceedingly timid and weak,
 and in a manner exhausted." But when I was going to change the
 conversation, he suddenly rallied, said he had but a short time to live,
 and asked if the notary wrote rapidly, for he should dictate without
 making any pause. The notary was called, and he dictated his will there
 and then with such speed that the man could scarcely keep up with him; and
 when he had done, he asked me to read it out, saying to me, "What a good
 thing it is to look after what are called our riches." 'Sunt haec, quoe
 hominibus vocantur bona'. As soon as the will was signed, the chamber
 being full, he asked me if it would hurt him to talk. I answered, that it
 would not, if he did not speak too loud. He then summoned Mademoiselle de
 Saint Quentin, his niece, to him, and addressed her thus: "Dear niece,
 since my earliest acquaintance with thee, I have observed the marks of,
 great natural goodness in thee; but the services which thou rendered to
 me, with so much affectionate diligence, in my present and last necessity,
 inspire me with high hopes of thee; and I am under great obligations to
 thee, and give thee most affectionate thanks. Let me relieve my conscience
 by counselling thee to be, in the first place, devout, to God: for this
 doubtless is our first duty, failing which all others can be of little
 advantage or grace, but which, duly observed, carries with it necessarily
 all other virtues. After God, thou shouldest love thy father and mother?thy
 mother, my sister, whom I regard as one of the best and most intelligent
 of women, and by whom I beg of thee to let thy own life be regulated.
 Allow not thyself to be led away by pleasures; shun, like the plague, the
 foolish familiarities thou seest between some men and women; harmless
 enough at first, but which by insidious degrees corrupt the heart, and
 thence lead it to negligence, and then into the vile slough of vice.
 Credit me, the greatest safeguard to female chastity is sobriety of
 demeanour. I beseech and direct that thou often call to mind the
 friendship which was betwixt us; but I do not wish thee to mourn for me
 too much?an injunction which, so far as it is in my power, I lay on
 all my friends, since it might seem that by doing so they felt a jealousy
 of that blessed condition in which I am about to be placed by death. I
 assure thee, my dear, that if I had the option now of continuing in life
 or of completing the voyage on which I have set out, I should find it very
 hard to choose. Adieu, dear niece."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mademoiselle d'Arsat, his stepdaughter, was next called. He said to her:
 "Daughter, you stand in no great need of advice from me, insomuch as you
 have a mother, whom I have ever found most sagacious, and entirely in
 conformity with my own opinions and wishes, and whom I have never found
 faulty; with such a preceptress, you cannot fail to be properly
 instructed. Do not account it singular that I, with no tie of blood to
 you, am interested in you; for, being the child of one who is so closely
 allied to me, I am necessarily concerned in what concerns you; and
 consequently the affairs of your brother, M. d'Arsat, have ever been
 watched by me with as much care as my own; nor perhaps will it be to your
 disadvantage that you were my step-daughter. You enjoy sufficient store of
 wealth and beauty; you are a lady of good family; it only remains for you
 to add to these possessions the cultivation of your mind, in which I
 exhort you not to fail. I do not think necessary to warn you against vice,
 a thing so odious in women, for I would not even suppose that you could
 harbour any inclination for it?nay, I believe that you hold the very
 name in abhorrence. Dear daughter, farewell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All in the room were weeping and lamenting; but he held without
 interruption the thread of his discourse, which was pretty long. But when
 he had done, he directed us all to leave the room, except the women
 attendants, whom he styled his garrison. But first, calling to him my
 brother, M. de Beauregard, he said to him: "M. de Beauregard, you have my
 best thanks for all the care you have taken of me. I have now a thing
 which I am very anxious indeed to mention to you, and with your permission
 I will do so." As my brother gave him encouragement to proceed, he added:
 "I assure you that I never knew any man who engaged in the reformation of
 our Church with greater sincerity, earnestness, and single-heartedness
 than yourself. I consider that you were led to it by observing the vicious
 character of our prelates, which no doubt much requires setting in order,
 and by imperfections which time has brought into our Church. It is not my
 desire at present discourage you from this course, for I would have no one
 act in opposition to his conscience; but I wish, having regard to the good
 repute acquired by your family from its enduring concord?a family
 than which none can be dearer to me; a family, thank God! no member of
 which has ever been guilty of dishonour ?in regard, further, to the
 will of your good father to whom you owe so much, and of your, uncle, I
 wish you to avoid extreme means; avoid harshness and violence: be
 reconciled with your relatives; do not act apart, but unite. You perceive
 what disasters our quarrels have brought upon this kingdom, and I
 anticipate still worse mischiefs; and in your goodness and wisdom, beware
 of involving your family in such broils; let it continue to enjoy its
 former reputation and happiness. M. de Beauregard, take what I say in good
 part, and as a proof of the friendship I feel for you. I postponed till
 now any communication with you on the subject, and perhaps the condition
 in which you see me address you, may cause my advice and opinion to carry
 greater authority." My brother expressed his thanks to him cordially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Monday morning he had become so ill that he quite despaired of
 himself; and he said to me very pitifully: "Brother, do not you feel pain
 for all the pain I am suffering? Do you not perceive now that the help you
 give me has no other effect than that of lengthening my suffering?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shortly afterwards he fainted, and we all thought him gone; but by the
 application of vinegar and wine he rallied. But he soon sank, and when he
 heard us in lamentation, he murmured, "O God! who is it that teases me so?
 Why did you break the agreeable repose I was enjoying? I beg of you to
 leave me." And then, when he caught the sound of my voice, he continued:
 "And art thou, my brother, likewise unwilling to see me at peace? O, how
 thou robbest me of my repose!" After a while, he seemed to gain more
 strength, and called for wine, which he relished, and declared it to be
 the finest drink possible. I, in order to change the current of his
 thoughts, put in, "Surely not; water is the best." "Ah, yes," he returned,
 "doubtless so;?(Greek phrase)?." He had now become, icy-cold
 at his extremities, even to his face; a deathly perspiration was upon him,
 and his pulse was scarcely perceptible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This morning he confessed, but the priest had omitted to bring with him
 the necessary apparatus for celebrating Mass. On the Tuesday, however, M.
 de la Boetie summoned him to aid him, as he said, in discharging the last
 office of a Christian. After the conclusion of Mass, he took the
 sacrament; when the priest was about to depart, he said to him: "Spiritual
 father, I implore you humbly, as well as those over whom you are set, to
 pray to the Almighty on my behalf; that, if it be decreed in heaven that I
 am now to end my life, He will take compassion on my soul, and pardon me
 my sins, which are manifold, it not being possible for so weak and poor a
 creature as I to obey completely the will of such a Master; or, if He
 think fit to keep me longer here, that it may please Him to release my
 present extreme anguish, and to direct my footsteps in the right path,
 that I may become a better man than I have been." He paused to recover
 breath a little; priest was about to go away, he called him back and
 proceeded: "I desire to say, besides, in your hearing this: I declare that
 I was christened and I have lived, and that so I wish to die, in the faith
 which Moses preached in Egypt; which afterwards the Patriarchs accepted
 and professed in Judaea; and which, in the course of time, has been
 transmitted to France and to us." He seemed desirous of adding something
 more, but he ended with a request to his uncle and me to send up prayers
 for him; "for those are," he said, "the best duties that Christians can
 fulfil one for another." In the course of talking, his shoulder was
 uncovered, and although a man-servant stood near him, he asked his uncle
 to re-adjust the clothes. Then, turning his eyes towards me, he said,
 "Ingenui est, cui multum debeas, ei plurimum velle debere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 M. de Belot called in the afternoon to see him, and M. de la Boetie,
 taking his hand, said to him: "I was on the point of discharging my debt,
 but my kind creditor has given me a little further time." A little while
 after, appearing to wake out of a sort of reverie, he uttered words which
 he had employed once or twice before in the course of his sickness: "Ah
 well, ah well, whenever the hour comes, I await it with pleasure and
 fortitude." And then, as they were holding his mouth open by force to give
 him a draught, he observed to M. de Belot: "An vivere tanti est?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the evening approached, he began perceptibly to sink; and while I
 supped, he sent for me to come, being no more than the shadow of a man,
 or, as he put it himself, 'non homo, sed species hominis'; and he said to
 me with the utmost difficulty: "My brother, my friend, please God I may
 realise the imaginations I have just enjoyed." Afterwards, having waited
 for some time while he remained silent, and by painful efforts was drawing
 long sighs (for his tongue at this point began to refuse its functions), I
 said, "What are they?" "Grand, grand!" he replied. "I have never yet
 failed," returned I, "to have the honour of hearing your conceptions and
 imaginations communicated to me; will you not now still let me enjoy
 them?" "I would indeed," he answered; "but, my brother, I am not able to
 do so; they are admirable, infinite, and unspeakable." We stopped short
 there, for he could not go on. A little before, indeed, he had shown a
 desire to speak to his wife, and had told her, with as gay a countenance
 as he could contrive to assume, that he had a story to tell her. And it
 seemed as if he was making an attempt to gain utterance; but, his strength
 failing him, he begged a little wine to resuscitate it. It was of no
 avail, for he fainted away suddenly, and was for some time insensible.
 Having become so near a neighbour to death, and hearing the sobs of
 Mademoiselle de la Boetie, he called her, and said to her thus: "My own
 likeness, you grieve yourself beforehand; will you not have pity on me?
 take courage. Assuredly, it costs me more than half the pain I endure, to
 see you suffer; and reasonably so, because the evils which we ourselves
 feel we do not actually ourselves suffer, but it certain sentient
 faculties which God plants in us, that feel them: whereas what we feel on
 account of others, we feel by consequence of a certain reasoning process
 which goes on within our minds. But I am going away" ?That he said
 because his strength was failing him; and fearing that he had frightened
 his wife, he resumed, observing: "I am going to sleep. Good night, my
 wife; go thy way." This was the last farewell he took of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After she had left, "My brother," said he to me, "keep near me, if you
 please;" and then feeling the advance of death more pressing and more
 acute, or else the effect of some warm draught which they had made him
 swallow, his voice grew stronger and clearer, and he turned quite with
 violence in his bed, so that all began again to entertain the hope which
 we had lost only upon witnessing his extreme prostration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this stage he proceeded, among other things, to pray me again and
 again, in a most affectionate manner, to give him a place; so that I was
 apprehensive that his reason might be impaired, particularly when, on my
 pointing out to him that he was doing himself harm, and that these were
 not of the words of a rational man, he did not yield at first, but
 redoubled his outcry, saying, "My brother, my brother! dost thou then
 refuse me a place?" insomuch that he constrained me to demonstrate to him
 that, as he breathed and spoke, and had his physical being, therefore he
 had his place. "Yes, yes," he responded, "I have; but it is not that which
 I need; and, besides, when all is said, I have no longer any existence."
 "God," I replied, "will grant you a better one soon." "Would it were now,
 my brother," was his answer. "It is now three days since I have been eager
 to take my departure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Being in this extremity, he frequently called me, merely to satisfy him
 that I was at his side. At length, he composed himself a little to rest,
 which strengthened our hopes; so much so, indeed, that I left the room,
 and went to rejoice thereupon with Mademoiselle de la Boetie. But, an hour
 or so afterwards, he called me by name once or twice, and then with a long
 sigh expired at three o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 18th August 1563,
 having lived thirty-two years, nine months, and seventeen days.

 II.??To Monseigneur, Monseigneur de MONTAIGNE.
 </h2>
 <p>
 [This letter is prefixed to Montaigne's translation of the "Natural
 Theology" of Raymond de Sebonde, printed at Paris in 1569.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In pursuance of the instructions which you gave me last year in your house
 at Montaigne, Monseigneur, I have put into a French dress, with my own
 hand, Raymond de Sebonde, that great Spanish theologian and philosopher;
 and I have divested him, so far as I could, of that rough bearing and
 barbaric appearance which you saw him wear at first; that, in my opinion,
 he is now qualified to present himself in the best company. It is
 perfectly possible that some fastidious persons will detect in the book
 some trace of Gascon parentage; but it will be so much the more to their
 discredit, that they allowed the task to devolve on one who is quite a
 novice in these things. It is only right, Monseigneur, that the work
 should come before the world under your auspices, since whatever
 emendations and polish it may have received, are owing to you. Still I see
 well that, if you think proper to balance accounts with the author, you
 will find yourself much his debtor; for against his excellent and
 religious discourses, his lofty and, so to speak, divine conceptions, you
 will find that you will have to set nothing but words and phraseology; a
 sort of merchandise so ordinary and commonplace, that whoever has the most
 of it, peradventure is the worst off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monseigneur, I pray God to grant you a very long and happy life. From
 Paris, this 18th of June 1568. Your most humble and most obedient son,

 Order, Privy Councillor, Sub-controller of his Finance, and Captain of the
 Cent Gardes of his Household.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MONSIEUR,?I send you the OEconomics of Xenophon, put into French by
 the late M. de la Boetie,?[Printed at Paris, 8vo, 1571, and
 reissued, with the addition of some notes, in 1572, with a fresh
 title-page.]?a present which appears to me to be appropriate, as
 well because it is the work of a gentleman of mark,?[Meaning
 Xenophon.]?a man illustrious in war and peace, as because it has
 taken its second shape from a personage whom I know to have been held by
 you in affectionate regard during his life. This will be an inducement to
 you to continue to cherish towards his memory, your good opinion and
 goodwill. And to be bold with you, Monsieur, do not fear to increase these
 sentiments somewhat; for, as you had knowledge of his high qualities only
 in his public capacity, it rests with me to assure you how many endowments
 he possessed beyond your personal experience of him. He did me the honour,
 while he lived, and I count it amongst the most fortunate circumstances in
 my own career, to have with me a friendship so close and so intricately
 knit, that no movement, impulse, thought, of his mind was kept from me,
 and if I have not formed a right judgment of him, I must suppose it to be
 from my own want of scope. Indeed, without exaggeration, he was so nearly
 a prodigy, that I am afraid of not being credited when I speak of him,
 even though I should keep much within the mark of my own actual knowledge.
 And for this time, Monsieur, I shall content myself with praying you, for
 the honour and respect we owe to truth, to testify and believe that our
 Guienne never beheld his peer among the men of his vocation. Under the
 hope, therefore, that you will pay him his just due, and in order to
 refresh him in your memory, I present you this book, which will answer for
 me that, were it not for the insufficiency of my power, I would offer you
 as willingly something of my own, as an acknowledgment of the obligations
 I owe to you, and of the ancient favour and friendship which you have
 borne towards the members of our house. But, Monsieur, in default of
 better coin, I offer you in payment the assurance of my desire to do you
 humble service.

 IV.??To Monsieur, Monsieur de MESMES, Lord of Roissy and
 Malassize, Privy
 </h2>
 <p>
 Councillor to the King.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MONSIEUR,?It is one of the most conspicuous follies committed by
 men, to employ the strength of their understanding in overturning and
 destroying those opinions which are commonly received among us, and which
 afford us satisfaction and content; for while everything beneath heaven
 employs the ways and means placed at its disposal by nature for the
 advancement and commodity of its being, these, in order to appear of a
 more sprightly and enlightened wit, not accepting anything which has not
 been tried and balanced a thousand times with the most subtle reasoning,
 sacrifice their peace of mind to doubt, uneasiness, and feverish
 excitement. It is not without reason that childhood and simplicity have
 been recommended by holy writ itself. For my part, I prefer to be quiet
 rather than clever: give me content, even if I am not to be so wide in my
 range. This is the reason, Monsieur, why, although persons of an ingenious
 turn laugh at our care as to what will happen after our own time, for
 instance, to our souls, which, lodged elsewhere, will lose all
 consciousness of what goes on here below, yet I consider it to be a great
 consolation for the frailty and brevity of life, to reflect that we have
 the power of prolonging it by reputation and fame; and I embrace very
 readily this pleasant and favourable notion original with our being,
 without inquiring too critically how or why it is. Insomuch that having
 loved, beyond everything, the late M. de la Boetie, the greatest man, in
 my judgment, of our age, I should think myself very negligent of my duty
 if I failed, to the utmost of my power, to prevent such a name as his, and
 a memory so richly meriting remembrance, from falling into oblivion; and
 if I did not use my best endeavour to keep them fresh. I believe that he
 feels something of what I do on his behalf, and that my services touch and
 rejoice him. In fact, he lives in my heart so vividly and so wholly, that
 I am loath to believe him committed to the dull ground, or altogether cast
 off from communication with us. Therefore, Monsieur, since every new light
 I can shed on him and his name, is so much added to his second period of
 existence, and, moreover, since his name is ennobled and honoured by the
 place which receives it, it falls to me not only to extend it as widely as
 I can, but to confide it to the keeping of persons of honour and virtue;
 among whom you hold such a rank, that, to afford you the opportunity of
 receiving this new guest, and giving him good entertainment, I decided on
 presenting to you this little work, not for any profit you are likely to
 derive from it, being well aware that you do not need to have Plutarch and
 his companions interpreted to you?but it is possible that Madame de
 Roissy, reading in it the order of her household management and of your
 happy accord painted to the life, will be pleased to see how her own
 natural inclination has not only reached but surpassed the theories of the
 wisest philosophers, regarding the duties and laws of the wedded state.
 And, at all events, it will be always an honour to me, to be able to do
 anything which shall be for the pleasure of you and yours, on account of
 the obligation under which I lie to serve you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur, I pray God to grant you a long and happy life. From Montaigne,
 this 30th April 1570. Your humble servant, MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.

 <h2>
 V.??To Monsieur, Monsieur de L'HOSPITAL, Chancellor of France
 </h2>
 <p>
 MONSEIGNEUR,?I am of the opinion that persons such as you, to whom
 fortune and reason have committed the charge of public affairs, are not
 more inquisitive in any point than in ascertaining the character of those
 in office under you; for no society is so poorly furnished, but that, if a
 proper distribution of authority be used, it has persons sufficient for
 the discharge of all official duties; and when this is the case, nothing
 is wanting to make a State perfect in its constitution. Now, in proportion
 as this is so much to be desired, so it is the more difficult of
 accomplishment, since you cannot have eyes to embrace a multitude so large
 and so widely extended, nor to see to the bottom of hearts, in order that
 you may discover intentions and consciences, matters principally to be
 considered; so that there has never been any commonwealth so well
 organised, in which we might not detect often enough defect in such a
 department or such a choice; and in those systems, where ignorance and
 malice, favouritism, intrigue, and violence govern, if any selection
 happens to be made on the ground of merit and regularity, we may doubtless
 thank Fortune, which, in its capricious movements, has for once taken the
 path of reason.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This consideration, Monseigneur, often consoled me, when I beheld M.
 Etienne de la Boetie, one of the fittest men for high office in France,
 pass his whole life without employment and notice, by his domestic hearth,
 to the singular detriment of the public; for, so far as he was concerned,
 I may assure you, Monseigneur, that he was so rich in those treasures
 which defy fortune, that never was man more satisfied or content. I know,
 indeed, that he was raised to the dignities connected with his
 neighbourhood?dignities accounted considerable; and I know also,
 that no one ever acquitted himself better of them; and when he died at the
 age of thirty-two, he enjoyed a reputation in that way beyond all who had
 preceded him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But for all that, it is no reason that a man should be left a common
 soldier, who deserves to become a captain; nor to assign mean functions to
 those who are perfectly equal to the highest. In truth, his powers were
 badly economised and too sparingly employed; insomuch that, over and above
 his actual work, there was abundant capacity lying idle which might have
 been called into service, both to the public advantage and his own private
 glory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Therefore, Monseigneur, since he was so indifferent to his own fame (for
 virtue and ambition, unfortunately, seldom lodge together), and since he
 lived in an age when others were too dull or too jealous to witness to his
 character, I have it marvellously at heart that his memory, at all events,
 to which I owe the good offices of a friend, should enjoy the recompense
 of his brave life; and that it should survive in the good report of men of
 honour and virtue. On this account, sir, I have been desirous to bring to
 light, and present to you, such few Latin verses as he left behind.
 Different from the builder, who places the most attractive, portion of his
 house towards the street, and to the draper, who displays in his window
 his best goods, that which was most precious in my friend, the juice and
 marrow of his genius, departed with him, and there have remained to us but
 the bark and the leaves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The exactly regulated movements of his mind, his piety, his virtue, his
 justice, his vivacity, the solidity and soundness of his judgment, the
 loftiness of his ideas, raised so far above the common level, his
 learning, the grace which accompanied his most ordinary actions, the
 tender affection he had for his miserable country, and his supreme and
 sworn detestation of all vice, but principally of that villainous traffic
 which disguises itself under the honourable name of justice, should
 certainly impress all well-disposed persons with a singular love towards
 him, and an extraordinary regret for his loss. But, sir, I am unable to do
 justice to all these qualities; and of the fruit of his own studies it had
 not entered into his mind to leave any proof to posterity; all that
 remains, is the little which, as a pastime, he did at intervals.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However this may be, I beg you, sir, to receive it kindly; and as our
 judgment of great things is many times formed from lesser things, and as
 even the recreations of illustrious men carry with them, to intelligent
 observers, some honourable traits of their origin, I would have you form
 from this, some knowledge of him, and hence lovingly cherish his name and
 his memory. In this, sir, you will only reciprocate the high opinion which
 he had of your virtue, and realise what he infinitely desired in his
 lifetime; for there was no one in the world in whose acquaintance and
 friendship he would have been so happy to see himself established, as in
 your own. But if any man is offended by the freedom which I use with the
 belongings of another, I can tell him that nothing which has been written
 or been laid down, even in the schools of philosophy, respecting the
 sacred duties and rights of friendship, could give an adequate idea of the
 relations which subsisted between this personage and myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Moreover, sir, this slender gift, to make two throws of one stone at the
 same time, may likewise serve, if you please, to testify the honour and
 respect which I entertain for your ability and high qualities; for as to
 those gifts which are adventitious and accidental, it is not to my taste
 to take them into account.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sir, I pray God to grant you a very happy and a very long life. From
 Montaigne, this 30th of April 1570.?Your humble and obedient
 servant,

 VI.??To Monsieur, Monsieur de Folx, Privy Councillor, and
 Ambassador of His Majesty to the Signory of Venice.
 </h2>
 <h3>
 ?[ Printed before the 'Vers Francois' of Etienne de la Boetie, 8vo,
 Paris, 1572.]
 </h3>
 <p>
 SIR,?Being on the point of commending to you and to posterity the
 memory of the late Etienne de la Boetie, as well for his extreme virtue as
 for the singular affection which he bore to me, it struck me as an
 indiscretion very serious in its results, and meriting some coercion from
 our laws, the practice which often prevails of robbing virtue of glory,
 its faithful associate, in order to confer it, in accordance with our
 private interests and without discrimination, on the first comer; seeing
 that our two principal guiding reins are reward and punishment, which only
 touch us properly, and as men, through the medium of honour and dishonour,
 forasmuch as these penetrate the mind, and come home to our most intimate
 feelings: just where animals themselves are susceptible, more or less, to
 all other kinds of recompense and corporal chastisement. Moreover, it is
 well to notice that the custom of praising virtue, even in those who are
 no longer with us, impalpable as it is to them, serves as a stimulant to
 the living to imitate their example; just as capital sentences are carried
 out by the law, more for the sake of warning to others, than in relation
 to those who suffer. Now, commendation and its opposite being analogous as
 regards effects, we cannot easily deny the fact, that although the law
 prohibits one man from slandering the reputation of another, it does not
 prevent us from bestowing reputation without cause. This pernicious
 licence in respect to the distribution of praise, has formerly been
 confined in its area of operations; and it may be the reason why poetry
 once lost favour with the more judicious. However this may be, it cannot
 be concealed that the vice of falsehood is one very unbecoming in
 gentleman, let it assume what guise it will.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As for that personage of whom I am speaking to you, sir he leads me far
 away indeed from this kind of language; for the danger in his case is not,
 lest I should lend him anything, but that I might take something from him;
 and it is his ill-fortune that, while he has supplied me, so far as ever a
 man could, with just and obvious opportunities for commendation, I find
 myself unable and unqualified to render it to him ?I, who am his
 debtor for so many vivid communications, and who alone have it in my power
 to answer for a million of accomplishments, perfections, and virtues,
 latent (thanks to his unkind stars) in so noble a soul. For the nature of
 things having (I know not how) permitted that truth, fair and acceptable?as
 it may be of itself, is only embraced where there are arts of persuasion,
 to insinuate it into our minds, I see myself so wanting, both in authority
 to support my simple testimony, and in the eloquence requisite for lending
 it value and weight, that I was on the eve of relinquishing the task,
 having nothing of his which would enable me to exhibit to the world a
 proof of his genius and knowledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In truth, sir, having been overtaken by his fate in the flower of his age,
 and in the full enjoyment of the most vigorous health, it had been his
 design to publish some day works which would have demonstrated to
 posterity what sort of a man he was; and, peradventure, he was indifferent
 enough to fame, having formed such a plan in his head, to proceed no
 further in it. But I have come to the conclusion, that it was far more
 excusable in him to bury with him all his rare endowments, than it would
 be on my part to bury also with me the knowledge of them which I had
 acquired from him; and, therefore, having collected with care all the
 remains which I found scattered here and there among his papers, I intend
 to distribute them so as to recommend his memory to as many persons as
 possible, selecting the most suitable and worthy of my acquaintance, and
 those whose testimony might do him greatest honour: such as you, sir, who
 may very possibly have had some knowledge of him during his life, but
 assuredly too slight to discover the perfect extent of his worth.
 Posterity may credit me, if it chooses, when I swear upon my conscience,
 that I knew and saw him to be such as, all things considered, I could
 neither desire nor imagine a genius surpassing his.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I beg you very humbly, sir, not only to take his name under your general
 protection, but also these ten or twelve French stanzas, which lay
 themselves, as of necessity, under shadow of your patronage. For I will
 not disguise from you, that their publication was deferred, upon the
 appearance of his other writings, under the pretext (as it was alleged
 yonder at Paris) that they were too crude to come to light. You will
 judge, sir, how much truth there is in this; and since it is thought that
 hereabout nothing can be produced in our own dialect but what is barbarous
 and unpolished, it falls to you, who, besides your rank as the first house
 in Guienne, indeed down from your ancestors, possess every other sort of
 qualification, to establish, not merely by your example, but by your
 authoritative testimony, that such is not always the case: the more so
 that, though 'tis more natural with the Gascons to act than talk, yet
 sometimes they employ the tongue more than the arm, and wit in place of
 valour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For my own part; sir, it is not in my way to judge of such matters; but I
 have heard persons who are supposed to understand them, say that these
 stanzas are not only worthy to be presented in the market-place, but,
 independently of that, as regards beauty and wealth of invention, they are
 full of marrow and matter as any compositions of the kind, which have
 appeared in our language. Naturally each workman feels himself more strong
 in some special part his art, and those are to be regarded as most
 fortunate, who lay hands on the noblest, for all the parts essential to
 the construction of any whole are not equally precious. We find elsewhere,
 perhaps, greater delicacy phrase, greater softness and harmony of
 language; but imaginative grace, and in the store of pointed wit, I do not
 think he has been surpassed; and we should take the account that he made
 these things neither his occupation nor his study, and that he scarcely
 took a pen in his hand more than once a year, as is shown by the very
 slender quantity of his remains. For you see here, sir, green wood and
 dry, without any sort of selection, all that has come into my possession;
 insomuch that there are among the rest efforts even of his boyhood. In
 point of fact, he seems to have written them merely to show that he was
 capable of dealing with all subjects: for otherwise, thousands of times,
 in the course of ordinary conversation, I have heard things drop from him
 infinitely more worthy of being admired, infinitely more worthy of being
 preserved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such, sir, is what justice and affection, forming in this instance a rare
 conjunction, oblige me to say of this great and good man; and if I have at
 all offended by the freedom which I have taken in addressing myself to you
 on such a subject at such a length, be pleased to recollect that the
 principal result of greatness and eminence is to lay one open to
 importunate appeals on behalf of the rest of the world. Herewith, after
 desiring you to accept my affectionate devotion to your service, I beseech
 God to vouchsafe you, sir, a fortunate and prolonged life. From Montaigne,
 this 1st of September 1570.?Your obedient servant,

 </p><br>
 <p>
 MY WIFE,?You understand well that it is not proper for a man of the
 world, according to the rules of this our time, to continue to court and
 caress you; for they say that a sensible person may take a wife indeed,
 but that to espouse her is to act like a fool. Let them talk; I adhere for
 my part the custom of the good old days; I also wear my hair as it used to
 be then; and, in truth, novelty costs this poor country up to the present
 moment so dear (and I do not know whether we have reached the highest
 pitch yet), that everywhere and in everything I renounce the fashion. Let
 us live, my wife, you and I, in the old French method. Now, you may
 recollect that the late M. de la Boetie, my brother and inseparable
 companion, gave me, on his death-bed, all his books and papers, which have
 remained ever since the most precious part of my effects. I do not wish to
 keep them niggardly to myself alone, nor do I deserve to have the
 exclusive use of them; so that I have resolved to communicate them to my
 friends; and because I have none, I believe, more particularly intimate
 you, I send you the Consolatory Letter written by Plutarch to his Wife,
 translated by him into French; regretting much that fortune has made it so
 suitable a present you, and that, having had but one child, and that a
 daughter, long looked for, after four years of your married life it was
 your lot to lose her in the second year of her age. But I leave to
 Plutarch the duty of comforting you, acquainting you with your duty
 herein, begging you to put your faith in him for my sake; for he will
 reveal to you my own ideas, and will express the matter far better than I
 should myself. Hereupon, my wife, I commend myself very heartily to your
 good will, and pray God to have you in His keeping. From Paris, this 10th

 him the present letter.]?the King's Councillor in his Court and
 Parliament of Paris.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MONSIEUR,?The business of the Sieur de Verres, a prisoner, who is
 extremely well known to me, deserves, in the arrival at a decision, the
 exercise of the clemency natural to you, if, in the public interest, you
 can fairly call it into play. He has done a thing not only excusable,
 according to the military laws of this age, but necessary and (as we are
 of opinion) commendable. He committed the act, without doubt, unwillingly
 and under pressure; there is no other passage of his life which is open to
 reproach. I beseech you, sir, to lend the matter your attentive
 consideration; you will find the character of it as I represent it to you.
 He is persecuted on this crime, in a way which is far worse than the
 offence itself. If it is likely to be of use to him, I desire to inform
 you that he is a man brought up in my house, related to several
 respectable families, and a person who, having led an honourable life, is
 my particular friend. By saving him you lay me under an extreme
 obligation. I beg you very humbly to regard him as recommended by me, and,
 after kissing your hands, I pray God, sir, to grant you a long and happy
 life. From Castera, this 23d of April 1580. Your affectionate servant,
 MONTAIGNE.

 <p>
 SIRE, It is to be above the weight and crowd of your great and important
 affairs, to know, as you do, how to lend yourself, and attend to small
 matters in their turn, according to the duty of your royal dignity, which
 exposes you at all times to every description and degree of person and
 employment. Yet, that your Majesty should have deigned to consider my
 letter, and direct a reply to be made to it, I prefer to owe, less to your
 strong understanding, than to your kindness of heart. I have always looked
 forward to your enjoyment of your present fortune, and you may recollect
 that, even when I had to make confession of itto my cure, I viewed your
 successes with satisfaction: now, with the greater propriety and freedom,
 I embrace them affectionately. They serve you where you are as positive
 matters of fact; but they serve us here no less by the fame which they
 diffuse: the echo carries as much weight as the blow. We should not be
 able to derive from the justice of your cause such powerful arguments for
 the maintenance and reduction of your subjects, as we do from the reports
 of the success of your undertaking; and then I have to assure your
 Majesty, that the recent changes to your advantage, which you observe
 hereabouts, the prosperous issue of your proceedings at Dieppe, have
 opportunely seconded the honest zeal and marvellous prudence of M. the
 Marshal de Matignon, from whom I flatter myself that you do not receive
 day by day accounts of such good and signal services without remembering
 my assurances and expectations. I look to the next summer, not only for
 fruits which we may eat, but for those to grow out of our common
 tranquillity, and that it will pass over our heads with the same even
 tenor of happiness, dissipating, like its predecessors, all the fine
 promises with which your adversaries sustain the spirits of their
 followers. The popular inclinations resemble a tidal wave; if the current
 once commences in your favour, it will go on of its own force to the end.
 I could have desired much that the private gain of the soldiers of your
 army, and the necessity for satisfying them, had not deprived you,
 especially in this principal town, of the glorious credit of treating your
 mutinous subjects, in the midst of victory, with greater clemency than
 their own protectors, and that, as distinguished from a passing and
 usurped repute, you could have shown them to be really your own, by the
 exercise of a protection truly paternal and royal. In the conduct of such
 affairs as you have in hand, men are obliged to have recourse to unusual
 expedients. It is always seen that they are surmounted by their magnitude
 and difficulty; it not being found easy to complete the conquest by arms
 and force, the end has been accomplished by clemency and generosity,
 excellent lures to draw men particularly towards the just and legitimate
 side. If there is to be severity and punishment, let it be deferred till
 success has been assured. A great conqueror of past times boasts that he
 gave his enemies as great an inducement to love him, as his friends. And
 here we feel already some effect of the favourable impression produced
 upon our rebellious towns by the contrast between their rude treatment,
 and that of those which are loyal to you. Desiring your Majesty a
 happiness more tangible and less hazardous, and that you may be beloved
 rather than feared by your people, and believing that your welfare and
 theirs are of necessity knit together, I rejoice to think that the
 progress which you make is one towards more practicable conditions of
 peace, as well as towards victory!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sire, your letter of the last of November came to my hand only just now,
 when the time which it pleased you to name for meeting you at Tours had
 already passed. I take it as a singular favour that you should have
 deigned to desire a visit from so useless a person, but one who is wholly
 yours, and more so even by affection than from duty. You have acted very
 commendably in adapting yourself, in the matter of external forms, to your
 new fortunes; but the preservation of your old affability and frankness in
 private intercourse is entitled to an equal share of praise. You have
 condescended to take thought for my age, no less than for the desire which
 I have to see you, where you may be at rest from these laborious
 agitations. Will not that be soon at Paris, Sire? and may nothing prevent
 me from presenting myself there!?Your very humble and very obedient
 servant and subject, MONTAIGNE.

 SIRE,?The letter which it pleased your majesty to write to me on the
 20th of July, was not delivered to me till this morning, and found me laid
 up with a very violent tertian ague, a complaint very common in this part
 of the country during the last month. Sire, I consider myself greatly
 honoured by the receipt of your commands, and I have not omitted to
 communicate to M. the Marshal de Matignon three times most emphatically my
 intention and obligation to proceed to him, and even so far as to indicate
 the route by which I proposed to join him secretly, if he thought proper.
 Having received no answer, I consider that he has weighed the difficulty
 and risk of the journey to me. Sire, your Majesty dill do me the favour to
 believe, if you please, that I shall never complain of the expense on
 occasions where I should not hesitate to devote my life. I have never
 derived any substantial benefit whatever from the bounty of kings, which I
 have neither sought nor merited; nor have I had any recompense for the
 services which I have performed for them: whereof your majesty is in part
 aware. What I have done for your predecessors I shall do still more
 readily for you. I am as rich, Sire, as I desire to be. When I shall have
 exhausted my purse in attendance on your Majesty at Paris, I will take the
 liberty to tell you, and then, if you should regard me as worthy of being
 retained any longer in your suite, you will find me more modest in my
 claims upon you than the humblest of your officers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sire, I pray God for your prosperity and health. Your very humble and very
 obedient servant and subject, MONTAIGNE.

 <h2>
 XVI.??To the Governor of Guienne.
 </h2>
 <p>
 MONSEIGNEUR,?I have received this morning your letter, which I have
 communicated to M. de Gourgues, and we have dined together at the house of
 M.[the mayor] of Bourdeaux. As to the inconvenience of transporting the
 money named in your memorandum, you see how difficult a thing it is to
 provide for; but you may be sure that we shall keep as close a watch over
 it as possible. I used every exertion to discover the man of whom you
 spoke. He has not been here; and M. de Bordeaux has shown me a letter in
 which he mentions that he could not come to see the Director of Bordeaux,
 as he intended, having been informed that you mistrust him. The letter is
 of the day before yesterday. If I could have found him, I might perhaps
 have pursued the gentler course, being uncertain of your views; but I
 entreat you nevertheless to feel no manner of doubt that I refuse to carry
 out any wishes of yours, and that, where your commands are concerned, I
 know no distinction of person or matter. I hope that you have in Guienne
 many as well affected to you as I am. They report that the Nantes galleys
 are advancing towards Brouage. M. the Marshal de Biron has not yet left.
 Those who were charged to convey the message to M. d'Usee say that they
 cannot find him; and I believe that, if he has been here, he is so no
 longer. We keep a vigilant eye on our gates and guards, and we look after
 them a little more attentively in your absence, which makes me
 apprehensive, not merely on account of the preservation of the town, but
 likewise for your oven sake, knowing that the enemies of the king feel how
 necessary you are to his service, and how ill we should prosper without
 you. I am afraid that, in the part where you are, you will be overtaken by
 so many affairs requiring your attention on every side, that it will take
 you a long time and involve great difficulty before you have disposed of
 everything. If there is any important news, I will despatch an express at
 once, and you may conclude that nothing is stirring if you do not hear
 from me: at the same time begging you to bear in mind that movements of
 this kind are wont to be so sudden and unexpected that, if they occur,
 they will grasp me by the throat, before they say a word. I will do what I
 can to collect news, and for this purpose I will make a point of visiting
 and seeing men of every shade of opinion. Down to the present time nothing
 is stirring. M. de Londel has seen me this morning, and we have been
 arranging for some advances for the place, where I shall go to-morrow
 morning. Since I began this letter, I have learnt from Chartreux that two
 gentlemen, describing themselves as in the service of M. de Guise, and
 coming from Agen, have passed near Chartreux; but I was not able to
 ascertain which road they have taken. They are expecting you at Agen. The
 Sieur de Mauvesin came as far as Canteloup, and thence returned, having
 got some intelligence. I am in search of one Captain Rous, to whom . . .
 wrote, trying to draw him into his cause by all sorts of promises. The
 rumour of the two Nantes galleys ready to descend on Brouage is confirmed
 as certain; they carry two companies of foot. M. de Mercure is at Nantes.
 The Sieur de la Courbe said to M. the President Nesmond that M. d'Elbeuf
 is on this side of Angiers, and lodges with his father. He is drawing
 towards Lower Poictou with 4000 foot and 400 or 500 horse, having been
 reinforced by the troops of M. de Brissac and others, and M. de Mercure is
 to join him. The report goes also that M. du Maine is about to take the
 command of all the forces they have collected in Auvergne, and that he
 will cross Le Foret to advance on Rouergue and us, that is to say, on the
 King of Navarre, against whom all this is being directed. M. de Lansac is
 at Bourg, and has two war vessels, which remain in attendance on him. His
 functions are naval. I tell you what I learn, and mix up together the more
 or less probable hearsay of the town with actual matter of fact, that you
 may be in possession of everything. I beg you most humbly to return
 directly affairs may allow you to do so, and assure you that, meanwhile,
 we shall not spare our labour, or (if that were necessary) our life, to
 maintain the king's authority throughout. Monseigneur, I kiss your hands
 very respectfully, and pray God to have you in His keeping. From Bordeaux,
 Wednesday night, 22d May (1590-91).?Your very humble servant,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MONTAIGNE.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have seen no one from the king of Navarre; they say that M. de Biron has
 seen him.

</pre>
 <p>
 ?[Omitted by Cotton.]?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 READER, thou hast here an honest book; it doth at the outset forewarn thee
 that, in contriving the same, I have proposed to myself no other than a
 domestic and private end: I have had no consideration at all either to thy
 service or to my glory. My powers are not capable of any such design. I
 have dedicated it to the particular commodity of my kinsfolk and friends,
 so that, having lost me (which they must do shortly), they may therein
 recover some traits of my conditions and humours, and by that means
 preserve more whole, and more life-like, the knowledge they had of me. Had
 my intention been to seek the world's favour, I should surely have adorned
 myself with borrowed beauties: I desire therein to be viewed as I appear
 in mine own genuine, simple, and ordinary manner, without study and
 artifice: for it is myself I paint. My defects are therein to be read to
 the life, and any imperfections and my natural form, so far as public
 reverence hath permitted me. If I had lived among those nations, which
 (they say) yet dwell under the sweet liberty of nature's primitive laws, I
 assure thee I would most willingly have painted myself quite fully and
 quite naked. Thus, reader, myself am the matter of my book: there's no
 reason thou shouldst employ thy leisure about so frivolous and vain a
 subject. Therefore farewell.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER I??THAT MEN BY VARIOUS WAYS ARRIVE AT THE SAME END.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The most usual way of appeasing the indignation of such as we have any way
 offended, when we see them in possession of the power of revenge, and find
 that we absolutely lie at their mercy, is by submission, to move them to
 commiseration and pity; and yet bravery, constancy, and resolution,
 however quite contrary means, have sometimes served to produce the same
 effect.?[Florio's version begins thus: "The most vsuall waie to
 appease those minds wee have offended, when revenge lies in their hands,
 and that we stand at their mercie, is by submission to move them to
 commiseration and pity: Nevertheless, courage, constancie, and resolution
 (means altogether opposite) have sometimes wrought the same effect."?]
 [The spelling is Florio's D.W.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Edward, Prince of Wales [Edward, the Black Prince. D.W.] (the same who so
 long governed our Guienne, a personage whose condition and fortune have in
 them a great deal of the most notable and most considerable parts of
 grandeur), having been highly incensed by the Limousins, and taking their
 city by assault, was not, either by the cries of the people, or the
 prayers and tears of the women and children, abandoned to slaughter and
 prostrate at his feet for mercy, to be stayed from prosecuting his
 revenge; till, penetrating further into the town, he at last took notice
 of three French gentlemen,?[These were Jean de Villemure, Hugh de la
 Roche, and Roger de Beaufort.?Froissart, i. c. 289. {The city was
 Limoges. D.W.}]?who with incredible bravery alone sustained the
 power of his victorious army. Then it was that consideration and respect
 unto so remarkable a valour first stopped the torrent of his fury, and
 that his clemency, beginning with these three cavaliers, was afterwards
 extended to all the remaining inhabitants of the city.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Scanderbeg, Prince of Epirus, pursuing one of his soldiers with purpose to
 kill him, the soldier, having in vain tried by all the ways of humility
 and supplication to appease him, resolved, as his last refuge, to face
 about and await him sword in hand: which behaviour of his gave a sudden
 stop to his captain's fury, who, for seeing him assume so notable a
 resolution, received him into grace; an example, however, that might
 suffer another interpretation with such as have not read of the prodigious
 force and valour of that prince.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Emperor Conrad III. having besieged Guelph, Duke of Bavaria,?[In
 1140, in Weinsberg, Upper Bavaria.]?would not be prevailed upon,
 what mean and unmanly satisfactions soever were tendered to him, to
 condescend to milder conditions than that the ladies and gentlewomen only
 who were in the town with the duke might go out without violation of their
 honour, on foot, and with so much only as they could carry about them.
 Whereupon they, out of magnanimity of heart, presently contrived to carry
 out, upon their shoulders, their husbands and children, and the duke
 himself; a sight at which the emperor was so pleased, that, ravished with
 the generosity of the action, he wept for joy, and immediately
 extinguishing in his heart the mortal and capital hatred he had conceived
 against this duke, he from that time forward treated him and his with all
 humanity. The one and the other of these two ways would with great
 facility work upon my nature; for I have a marvellous propensity to mercy
 and mildness, and to such a degree that I fancy of the two I should sooner
 surrender my anger to compassion than to esteem. And yet pity is reputed a
 vice amongst the Stoics, who will that we succour the afflicted, but not
 that we should be so affected with their sufferings as to suffer with
 them. I conceived these examples not ill suited to the question in hand,
 and the rather because therein we observe these great souls assaulted and
 tried by these two several ways, to resist the one without relenting, and
 to be shook and subjected by the other. It may be true that to suffer a
 man's heart to be totally subdued by compassion may be imputed to
 facility, effeminacy, and over-tenderness; whence it comes to pass that
 the weaker natures, as of women, children, and the common sort of people,
 are the most subject to it but after having resisted and disdained the
 power of groans and tears, to yield to the sole reverence of the sacred
 image of Valour, this can be no other than the effect of a strong and
 inflexible soul enamoured of and honouring masculine and obstinate
 courage. Nevertheless, astonishment and admiration may, in less generous
 minds, beget a like effect: witness the people of Thebes, who, having put
 two of their generals upon trial for their lives for having continued in
 arms beyond the precise term of their commission, very hardly pardoned
 Pelopidas, who, bowing under the weight of so dangerous an accusation,
 made no manner of defence for himself, nor produced other arguments than
 prayers and supplications; whereas, on the contrary, Epaminondas, falling
 to recount magniloquently the exploits he had performed in their service,
 and, after a haughty and arrogant manner reproaching them with ingratitude
 and injustice, they had not the heart to proceed any further in his trial,
 but broke up the court and departed, the whole assembly highly commending
 the high courage of this personage.?[Plutarch, How far a Man may
 praise Himself, c. 5.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dionysius the elder, after having, by a tedious siege and through
 exceeding great difficulties, taken the city of Reggio, and in it the
 governor Phyton, a very gallant man, who had made so obstinate a defence,
 was resolved to make him a tragical example of his revenge: in order
 whereunto he first told him, "That he had the day before caused his son
 and all his kindred to be drowned." To which Phyton returned no other
 answer but this: "That they were then by one day happier than he." After
 which, causing him to be stripped, and delivering him into the hands of
 the tormentors, he was by them not only dragged through the streets of the
 town, and most ignominiously and cruelly whipped, but moreover vilified
 with most bitter and contumelious language: yet still he maintained his
 courage entire all the way, with a strong voice and undaunted countenance
 proclaiming the honourable and glorious cause of his death; namely, for
 that he would not deliver up his country into the hands of a tyrant; at
 the same time denouncing against him a speedy chastisement from the
 offended gods. At which Dionysius, reading in his soldiers' looks, that
 instead of being incensed at the haughty language of this conquered enemy,
 to the contempt of their captain and his triumph, they were not only
 struck with admiration of so rare a virtue, but moreover inclined to
 mutiny, and were even ready to rescue the prisoner out of the hangman's
 hands, he caused the torturing to cease, and afterwards privately caused
 him to be thrown into the sea.?[Diod. Sic., xiv. 29.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Man (in good earnest) is a marvellous vain, fickle, and unstable subject,
 and on whom it is very hard to form any certain and uniform judgment. For
 Pompey could pardon the whole city of the Mamertines, though furiously
 incensed against it, upon the single account of the virtue and magnanimity
 of one citizen, Zeno,?[Plutarch calls him Stheno, and also Sthemnus
 and Sthenis]?who took the fault of the public wholly upon himself;
 neither entreated other favour, but alone to undergo the punishment for
 all: and yet Sylla's host, having in the city of Perugia ?[Plutarch
 says Preneste, a town of Latium.]?manifested the same virtue,
 obtained nothing by it, either for himself or his fellow-citizens.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, directly contrary to my first examples, the bravest of all men, and
 who was reputed so gracious to all those he overcame, Alexander, having,
 after many great difficulties, forced the city of Gaza, and, entering,
 found Betis, who commanded there, and of whose valour in the time of this
 siege he had most marvellous manifest proof, alone, forsaken by all his
 soldiers, his armour hacked and hewed to pieces, covered all over with
 blood and wounds, and yet still fighting in the crowd of a number of
 Macedonians, who were laying on him on all sides, he said to him, nettled
 at so dear-bought a victory (for, in addition to the other damage, he had
 two wounds newly received in his own person), "Thou shalt not die, Betis,
 as thou dost intend; be sure thou shall suffer all the torments that can
 be inflicted on a captive." To which menace the other returning no other
 answer, but only a fierce and disdainful look; "What," says Alexander,
 observing his haughty and obstinate silence, "is he too stiff to bend a
 knee! Is he too proud to utter one suppliant word! Truly, I will conquer
 this silence; and if I cannot force a word from his mouth, I will, at
 least, extract a groan from his heart." And thereupon converting his anger
 into fury, presently commanded his heels to be bored through, causing him,
 alive, to be dragged, mangled, and dismembered at a cart's tail.?[Quintus
 Curtius, iv. 6. This act of cruelty has been doubted, notwithstanding the
 statement of Curtius.]?Was it that the height of courage was so
 natural and familiar to this conqueror, that because he could not admire,
 he respected it the less? Or was it that he conceived valour to be a
 virtue so peculiar to himself, that his pride could not, without envy,
 endure it in another? Or was it that the natural impetuosity of his fury
 was incapable of opposition? Certainly, had it been capable of moderation,
 it is to be believed that in the sack and desolation of Thebes, to see so
 many valiant men, lost and totally destitute of any further defence,
 cruelly massacred before his eyes, would have appeased it: where there
 were above six thousand put to the sword, of whom not one was seen to fly,
 or heard to cry out for quarter; but, on the contrary, every one running
 here and there to seek out and to provoke the victorious enemy to help
 them to an honourable end. Not one was seen who, however weakened with
 wounds, did not in his last gasp yet endeavour to revenge himself, and
 with all the arms of a brave despair, to sweeten his own death in the
 death of an enemy. Yet did their valour create no pity, and the length of
 one day was not enough to satiate the thirst of the conqueror's revenge,
 but the slaughter continued to the last drop of blood that was capable of
 being shed, and stopped not till it met with none but unarmed persons, old
 men, women, and children, of them to carry away to the number of thirty
 thousand slaves.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER II??OF SORROW
 </h2>
 <p>
 No man living is more free from this passion than I, who yet neither like
 it in myself nor admire it in others, and yet generally the world, as a
 settled thing, is pleased to grace it with a particular esteem, clothing
 therewith wisdom, virtue, and conscience. Foolish and sordid guise!
 ?["No man is more free from this passion than I, for I neither love
 nor regard it: albeit the world hath undertaken, as it were upon covenant,
 to grace it with a particular favour. Therewith they adorne age, vertue,
 and conscience. Oh foolish and base ornament!" Florio, 1613, p. 3] ?The
 Italians have more fitly baptized by this name?[La tristezza]?
 malignity; for 'tis a quality always hurtful, always idle and vain; and as
 being cowardly, mean, and base, it is by the Stoics expressly and
 particularly forbidden to their sages.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the story?[Herodotus, iii. 14.]?says that Psammenitus,
 King of Egypt, being defeated and taken prisoner by Cambyses, King of
 Persia, seeing his own daughter pass by him as prisoner, and in a wretched
 habit, with a bucket to draw water, though his friends about him were so
 concerned as to break out into tears and lamentations, yet he himself
 remained unmoved, without uttering a word, his eyes fixed upon the ground;
 and seeing, moreover, his son immediately after led to execution, still
 maintained the same countenance; till spying at last one of his domestic
 and familiar friends dragged away amongst the captives, he fell to tearing
 his hair and beating his breast, with all the other extravagances of
 extreme sorrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A story that may very fitly be coupled with another of the same kind, of
 recent date, of a prince of our own nation, who being at Trent, and having
 news there brought him of the death of his elder brother, a brother on
 whom depended the whole support and honour of his house, and soon after of
 that of a younger brother, the second hope of his family, and having
 withstood these two assaults with an exemplary resolution; one of his
 servants happening a few days after to die, he suffered his constancy to
 be overcome by this last accident; and, parting with his courage, so
 abandoned himself to sorrow and mourning, that some thence were forward to
 conclude that he was only touched to the quick by this last stroke of
 fortune; but, in truth, it was, that being before brimful of grief, the
 least addition overflowed the bounds of all patience. Which, I think,
 might also be said of the former example, did not the story proceed to
 tell us that Cambyses asking Psammenitus, "Why, not being moved at the
 calamity of his son and daughter, he should with so great impatience bear
 the misfortune of his friend?" "It is," answered he, "because only this
 last affliction was to be manifested by tears, the two first far exceeding
 all manner of expression."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, peradventure, something like this might be working in the fancy of
 the ancient painter,?[Cicero, De Orator., c. 22 ; Pliny, xxxv. 10.]?
 who having, in the sacrifice of Iphigenia, to represent the sorrow of the
 assistants proportionably to the several degrees of interest every one had
 in the death of this fair innocent virgin, and having, in the other
 figures, laid out the utmost power of his art, when he came to that of her
 father, he drew him with a veil over his face, meaning thereby that no
 kind of countenance was capable of expressing such a degree of sorrow.
 Which is also the reason why the poets feign the miserable mother, Niobe,
 having first lost seven sons, and then afterwards as many daughters
 (overwhelmed with her losses), to have been at last transformed into a
 rock?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Diriguisse malis,"

 ["Petrified with her misfortunes."?Ovid, Met., vi. 304.]
</pre>
 <p>
 thereby to express that melancholic, dumb, and deaf stupefaction, which
 benumbs all our faculties, when oppressed with accidents greater than we
 are able to bear. And, indeed, the violence and impression of an excessive
 grief must of necessity astonish the soul, and wholly deprive her of her
 ordinary functions: as it happens to every one of us, who, upon any sudden
 alarm of very ill news, find ourselves surprised, stupefied, and in a
 manner deprived of all power of motion, so that the soul, beginning to
 vent itself in tears and lamentations, seems to free and disengage itself
 from the sudden oppression, and to have obtained some room to work itself
 out at greater liberty.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et via vix tandem voci laxata dolore est."

 ["And at length and with difficulty is a passage opened by grief for
 utterance."?AEneid, xi. 151.]
</pre>
 <p>
 In the war that Ferdinand made upon the widow of King John of Hungary,
 about Buda, a man-at-arms was particularly taken notice of by every one
 for his singular gallant behaviour in a certain encounter; and, unknown,
 highly commended, and lamented, being left dead upon the place: but by
 none so much as by Raisciac, a German lord, who was infinitely enamoured
 of so rare a valour. The body being brought off, and the count, with the
 common curiosity coming to view it, the armour was no sooner taken off but
 he immediately knew him to be his own son, a thing that added a second
 blow to the compassion of all the beholders; only he, without uttering a
 word, or turning away his eyes from the woeful object, stood fixedly
 contemplating the body of his son, till the vehemency of sorrow having
 overcome his vital spirits, made him sink down stone-dead to the ground.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Chi puo dir com' egli arde, a in picciol fuoco,"

 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Misero quod omneis
 Eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te,

 Quod loquar amens.

 Tintinant aures; gemina teguntur
 Lumina nocte."

 ["Love deprives me of all my faculties: Lesbia, when once in thy
 presence, I have not left the power to tell my distracting passion:
 my tongue becomes torpid; a subtle flame creeps through my veins; my
 ears tingle in deafness; my eyes are veiled with darkness."
 Catullus, Epig. li. 5]
</pre>
 <p>
 Neither is it in the height and greatest fury of the fit that we are in a
 condition to pour out our complaints or our amorous persuasions, the soul
 being at that time over-burdened, and labouring with profound thoughts;
 and the body dejected and languishing with desire; and thence it is that
 sometimes proceed those accidental impotencies that so unseasonably
 surprise the lover, and that frigidity which by the force of an immoderate
 ardour seizes him even in the very lap of fruition. ?[The edition of
 1588 has here, "An accident not unknown to myself."]? For all
 passions that suffer themselves to be relished and digested are but
 moderate:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent."

 ["Light griefs can speak: deep sorrows are dumb."
 ?Seneca, Hippolytus, act ii. scene 3.]
</pre>
 <p>
 A surprise of unexpected joy does likewise often produce the same effect:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ut me conspexit venientem, et Troja circum
 Arma amens vidit, magnis exterrita monstris,
 Diriguit visu in medio, calor ossa reliquit,
 Labitur, et longo vix tandem tempore fatur."

 ["When she beheld me advancing, and saw, with stupefaction, the
 Trojan arms around me, terrified with so great a prodigy, she
 fainted away at the very sight: vital warmth forsook her limbs: she
 sinks down, and, after a long interval, with difficulty speaks."?
 AEneid, iii. 306.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Besides the examples of the Roman lady, who died for joy to see her son
 safe returned from the defeat of Cannae; and of Sophocles and of Dionysius
 the Tyrant,?[Pliny, vii. 53. Diodorus Siculus, however (xv. c. 20),
 tells us that Dionysius "was so overjoyed at the news that he made a great
 sacrifice upon it to the gods, prepared sumptuous feasts, to which he
 invited all his friends, and therein drank so excessively that it threw
 him into a very bad distemper."]?who died of joy; and of Thalna, who
 died in Corsica, reading news of the honours the Roman Senate had decreed
 in his favour, we have, moreover, one in our time, of Pope Leo X., who
 upon news of the taking of Milan, a thing he had so ardently desired, was
 rapt with so sudden an excess of joy that he immediately fell into a fever
 and died.?[Guicciardini, Storia d'Italia, vol. xiv.]?And for a
 more notable testimony of the imbecility of human nature, it is recorded
 by the ancients?[Pliny, 'ut supra']?that Diodorus the
 dialectician died upon the spot, out of an extreme passion of shame, for
 not having been able in his own school, and in the presence of a great
 auditory, to disengage himself from a nice argument that was propounded to
 him. I, for my part, am very little subject to these violent passions; I
 am naturally of a stubborn apprehension, which also, by reasoning, I every
 day harden and fortify.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER III??THAT OUR AFFECTIONS CARRY THEMSELVES BEYOND US.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Such as accuse mankind of the folly of gaping after future things, and
 advise us to make our benefit of those which are present, and to set up
 our rest upon them, as having no grasp upon that which is to come, even
 less than that which we have upon what is past, have hit upon the most
 universal of human errors, if that may be called an error to which nature
 herself has disposed us, in order to the continuation of her own work,
 prepossessing us, amongst several others, with this deceiving imagination,
 as being more jealous of our action than afraid of our knowledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We are never present with, but always beyond ourselves: fear, desire,
 hope, still push us on towards the future, depriving us, in the meantime,
 of the sense and consideration of that which is to amuse us with the
 thought of what shall be, even when we shall be no more.?[Rousseau,

 We find this great precept often repeated in Plato, "Do thine own work,
 and know thyself." Of which two parts, both the one and the other
 generally, comprehend our whole duty, and do each of them in like manner
 involve the other; for who will do his own work aright will find that his
 first lesson is to know what he is, and that which is proper to himself;
 and who rightly understands himself will never mistake another man's work
 for his own, but will love and improve himself above all other things,
 will refuse superfluous employments, and reject all unprofitable thoughts
 and propositions. As folly, on the one side, though it should enjoy all it
 desire, would notwithstanding never be content, so, on the other, wisdom,
 acquiescing in the present, is never dissatisfied with itself. ?[Cicero,
 Tusc. Quae., 57, v. 18.]?Epicurus dispenses his sages from all
 foresight and care of the future.

 Amongst those laws that relate to the dead, I look upon that to be very
 sound by which the actions of princes are to be examined after their
 decease.?[Diodorus Siculus, i. 6.]? They are equals with, if
 not masters of the laws, and, therefore, what justice could not inflict
 upon their persons, 'tis but reason should be executed upon their
 reputations and the estates of their successors?things that we often
 value above life itself. 'Tis a custom of singular advantage to those
 countries where it is in use, and by all good princes to be desired, who
 have reason to take it ill, that the memories of the wicked should be used
 with the same reverence and respect with their own. We owe subjection and
 obedience to all our kings, whether good or bad, alike, for that has
 respect unto their office; but as to esteem and affection, these are only
 due to their virtue. Let us grant to political government to endure them
 with patience, however unworthy; to conceal their vices; and to assist
 them with our recommendation in their indifferent actions, whilst their
 authority stands in need of our support. But, the relation of prince and
 subject being once at an end, there is no reason we should deny the
 expression of our real opinions to our own liberty and common justice, and
 especially to interdict to good subjects the glory of having reverently
 and faithfully served a prince, whose imperfections were to them so well
 known; this were to deprive posterity of a useful example. And such as,
 out of respect to some private obligation, unjustly espouse and vindicate
 the memory of a faulty prince, do private right at the expense of public
 justice. Livy does very truly say,?[xxxv. 48.]? "That the
 language of men bred up in courts is always full of vain ostentation and
 false testimony, every one indifferently magnifying his own master, and
 stretching his commendation to the utmost extent of virtue and sovereign
 grandeur." Some may condemn the freedom of those two soldiers who so
 roundly answered Nero to his beard; the one being asked by him why he bore
 him ill-will? "I loved thee," answered he, "whilst thou wert worthy of it,
 but since thou art become a parricide, an incendiary, a player, and a
 coachman, I hate thee as thou dost deserve." And the other, why he should
 attempt to kill him? "Because," said he, "I could think of no other remedy
 against thy perpetual mischiefs." ?[Tacitus, Annal., xv. 67.]?But
 the public and universal testimonies that were given of him after his
 death (and so will be to all posterity, both of him and all other wicked
 princes like him), of his tyrannies and abominable deportment, who, of a
 sound judgment, can reprove them?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I am scandalised, that in so sacred a government as that of the
 Lacedaemonians there should be mixed so hypocritical a ceremony at the
 interment of their kings; where all their confederates and neighbours, and
 all sorts and degrees of men and women, as well as their slaves, cut and
 slashed their foreheads in token of sorrow, repeating in their cries and
 lamentations that that king (let him have been as wicked as the devil) was
 the best that ever they had;?[Herodotus, vi. 68.]?by this
 means attributing to his quality the praise that only belongs to merit,
 and that of right is due to supreme desert, though lodged in the lowest
 and most inferior subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aristotle, who will still have a hand in everything, makes a 'quaere' upon
 the saying of Solon, that none can be said to be happy until he is dead:
 "whether, then, he who has lived and died according to his heart's desire,
 if he have left an ill repute behind him, and that his posterity be
 miserable, can be said to be happy?" Whilst we have life and motion, we
 convey ourselves by fancy and preoccupation, whither and to what we
 please; but once out of being, we have no more any manner of communication
 with that which is, and it had therefore been better said by Solon that
 man is never happy, because never so, till he is no more.

 Bertrand de Guesclin, dying at the siege of the Castle of Rancon, near
 unto Puy, in Auvergne, the besieged were afterwards, upon surrender,
 enjoined to lay down the keys of the place upon the corpse of the dead
 general. Bartolommeo d'Alviano, the Venetian General, happening to die in
 the service of the Republic in Brescia, and his corpse being to be carried
 through the territory of Verona, an enemy's country, most of the army were
 inclined to demand safe-conduct from the Veronese; but Theodoro Trivulzio
 opposed the motion, rather choosing to make his way by force of arms, and
 to run the hazard of a battle, saying it was by no means fit that he who
 in his life was never afraid of his enemies should seem to apprehend them
 when he was dead. In truth, in affairs of the same nature, by the Greek
 laws, he who made suit to an enemy for a body to give it burial renounced
 his victory, and had no more right to erect a trophy, and he to whom such
 suit was made was reputed victor. By this means it was that Nicias lost
 the advantage he had visibly obtained over the Corinthians, and that
 Agesilaus, on the contrary, assured that which he had before very
 doubtfully gained over the Boeotians.?[Plutarch, Life of Nicias, c.
 ii.; Life of Agesilaus, c. vi.]

 <p>
 These things might appear strange, had it not been a general practice in
 all ages not only to extend the concern of ourselves beyond this life,
 but, moreover, to fancy that the favour of Heaven does not only very often
 accompany us to the grave, but has also, even after life, a concern for
 our ashes. Of which there are so many ancient examples (to say nothing of
 those of our own observation), that it is not necessary I should longer
 insist upon it. Edward I., King of England, having in the long wars
 betwixt him and Robert, King of Scotland, had experience of how great
 importance his own immediate presence was to the success of his affairs,
 having ever been victorious in whatever he undertook in his own person,
 when he came to die, bound his son in a solemn oath that, so soon as he
 should be dead he should boil his body till the flesh parted from the
 bones, and bury the flesh, reserving the bones to carry continually with
 him in his army, so often as he should be obliged to go against the Scots,
 as if destiny had inevitably attached victory, even to his remains. John
 Zisca, the same who, to vindication of Wicliffe's heresies, troubled the
 Bohemian state, left order that they should flay him after his death, and
 of his skin make a drum to carry in the war against his enemies, fancying
 it would contribute to the continuation of the successes he had always
 obtained in the wars against them. In like manner certain of the Indians,
 in their battles with the Spaniards, carried with them the bones of one of
 their captains, in consideration of the victories they had formerly
 obtained under his conduct. And other people of the same New World carry
 about with them, in their wars, the relics of valiant men who have died in
 battle, to incite their courage and advance their fortune. Of which
 examples the first reserve nothing for the tomb but the reputation they
 have acquired by their former achievements, but these attribute to them a
 certain present and active power.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The proceeding of Captain Bayard is of a better composition, who finding
 himself wounded to death with an harquebuss shot, and being importuned to
 retire out of the fight, made answer that he would not begin at the last
 gasp to turn his back to the enemy, and accordingly still fought on, till
 feeling himself too faint and no longer able to sit on his horse, he
 commanded his steward to set him down at the foot of a tree, but so that
 he might die with his face towards the enemy, which he did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I must yet add another example, equally remarkable for the present
 consideration with any of the former. The Emperor Maximilian,
 great-grandfather to the now King Philip,?[Philip II. of Spain.]?was
 a prince endowed throughout with great and extraordinary qualities, and
 amongst the rest with a singular beauty of person, but had withal a humour
 very contrary to that of other princes, who for the despatch of their most
 important affairs convert their close-stool into a chair of State, which
 was, that he would never permit any of his bedchamber, how familiar
 soever, to see him in that posture, and would steal aside to make water as
 religiously as a virgin, shy to discover to his physician or any other
 whomsoever those parts that we are accustomed to conceal. I myself, who
 have so impudent a way of talking, am, nevertheless, naturally so modest
 this way, that unless at the importunity of necessity or pleasure, I
 scarcely ever communicate to the sight of any either those parts or
 actions that custom orders us to conceal, wherein I suffer more constraint
 than I conceive is very well becoming a man, especially of my profession.
 But he nourished this modest humour to such a degree of superstition as to
 give express orders in his last will that they should put him on drawers
 so soon as he should be dead; to which, methinks, he would have done well
 to have added that he should be blindfolded, too, that put them on. The
 charge that Cyrus left with his children, that neither they, nor any
 other, should either see or touch his body after the soul was departed
 from it,?[Xenophon, Cyropedia, viii. 7.]?I attribute to some
 superstitious devotion of his; for both his historian and himself, amongst
 their great qualities, marked the whole course of their lives with a
 singular respect and reverence to religion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was by no means pleased with a story, told me by a man of very great
 quality of a relation of mine, and one who had given a very good account
 of himself both in peace and war, that, coming to die in a very old age,
 of excessive pain of the stone, he spent the last hours of his life in an
 extraordinary solicitude about ordering the honour and ceremony of his
 funeral, pressing all the men of condition who came to see him to engage
 their word to attend him to his grave: importuning this very prince, who
 came to visit him at his last gasp, with a most earnest supplication that
 he would order his family to be there, and presenting before him several
 reasons and examples to prove that it was a respect due to a man of his
 condition; and seemed to die content, having obtained this promise, and
 appointed the method and order of his funeral parade. I have seldom heard
 of so persistent a vanity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another, though contrary curiosity (of which singularity, also, I do not
 want domestic example), seems to be somewhat akin to this, that a man
 shall cudgel his brains at the last moments of his life to contrive his
 obsequies to so particular and unusual a parsimony as of one servant with
 a lantern, I see this humour commended, and the appointment of Marcus.
 Emilius Lepidus, who forbade his heirs to bestow upon his hearse even the
 common ceremonies in use upon such occasions. Is it yet temperance and
 frugality to avoid expense and pleasure of which the use and knowledge are
 imperceptible to us? See, here, an easy and cheap reformation. If
 instruction were at all necessary in this case, I should be of opinion
 that in this, as in all other actions of life, each person should regulate
 the matter according to his fortune; and the philosopher Lycon prudently
 ordered his friends to dispose of his body where they should think most
 fit, and as to his funeral, to order it neither too superfluous nor too
 mean. For my part, I should wholly refer the ordering of this ceremony to
 custom, and shall, when the time comes, accordingly leave it to their
 discretion to whose lot it shall fall to do me that last office. "Totus
 hic locus est contemnendus in nobis, non negligendus in nostris;"?["The
 place of our sepulture is to be contemned by us, but not to be neglected
 by our friends."?Cicero, Tusc. i. 45.]? and it was a holy
 saying of a saint, "Curatio funeris, conditio sepultura: pompa exequiarum,
 magis sunt vivorum solatia, quam subsidia mortuorum."?["The care of
 death, the place of sepulture, the pomps of obsequies, are rather
 consolations to the living than succours to the dead." August. De Civit.
 Dei, i. 12.]?Which made Socrates answer Crito, who, at death, asked
 him how he would be buried: "How you will," said he. "If I were to concern
 myself beyond the present about this affair, I should be most tempted, as
 the greatest satisfaction of this kind, to imitate those who in their
 lifetime entertain themselves with the ceremony and honours of their own
 obsequies beforehand, and are pleased with beholding their own dead
 countenance in marble. Happy are they who can gratify their senses by
 insensibility, and live by their death!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I am ready to conceive an implacable hatred against all popular
 domination, though I think it the most natural and equitable of all, so
 oft as I call to mind the inhuman injustice of the people of Athens, who,
 without remission, or once vouchsafing to hear what they had to say for
 themselves, put to death their brave captains newly returned triumphant
 from a naval victory they had obtained over the Lacedaemonians near the
 Arginusian Isles, the most bloody and obstinate engagement that ever the
 Greeks fought at sea; because (after the victory) they followed up the
 blow and pursued the advantages presented to them by the rule of war,
 rather than stay to gather up and bury their dead. And the execution is
 yet rendered more odious by the behaviour of Diomedon, who, being one of
 the condemned, and a man of most eminent virtue, political and military,
 after having heard the sentence, advancing to speak, no audience till then
 having been allowed, instead of laying before them his own cause, or the
 impiety of so cruel a sentence, only expressed a solicitude for his
 judges' preservation, beseeching the gods to convert this sentence to
 their good, and praying that, for neglecting to fulfil the vows which he
 and his companions had made (with which he also acquainted them) in
 acknowledgment of so glorious a success, they might not draw down the
 indignation of the gods upon them; and so without more words went
 courageously to his death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fortune, a few years after, punished them in the same kind; for Chabrias,
 captain-general of their naval forces, having got the better of Pollis,
 Admiral of Sparta, at the Isle of Naxos, totally lost the fruits of his
 victory, one of very great importance to their affairs, in order not to
 incur the danger of this example, and so that he should not lose a few
 bodies of his dead friends that were floating in the sea, gave opportunity
 to a world of living enemies to sail away in safety, who afterwards made
 them pay dear for this unseasonable superstition:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quaeris, quo jaceas, post obitum, loco?
 Quo non nata jacent."

 ["Dost ask where thou shalt lie after death?
 Where things not born lie, that never being had."]
 Seneca, Tyoa. Choro ii. 30.
</pre>
 <p>
 This other restores the sense of repose to a body without a soul:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Neque sepulcrum, quo recipiatur, habeat: portum corporis, ubi,
 remissa human, vita, corpus requiescat a malis."

 ["Nor let him have a sepulchre wherein he may be received, a haven
 for his body, where, life being gone, that body may rest from its
 woes."?Ennius, ap. Cicero, Tusc. i. 44.]
</pre>
 <p>
 As nature demonstrates to us that several dead things retain yet an occult
 relation to life; wine changes its flavour and complexion in cellars,
 according to the changes and seasons of the vine from whence it came; and
 the flesh of?venison alters its condition in the powdering-tub, and
 its taste according to the laws of the living flesh of its kind, as it is
 said.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV??THAT THE SOUL EXPENDS ITS PASSIONS UPON FALSE
 OBJECTS, WHERE THE TRUE ARE WANTING
 </h2>
 <p>
 A gentleman of my country, marvellously tormented with the gout, being
 importuned by his physicians totally to abstain from all manner of salt
 meats, was wont pleasantly to reply, that in the extremity of his fits he
 must needs have something to quarrel with, and that railing at and
 cursing, one while the Bologna sausages, and another the dried tongues and
 the hams, was some mitigation to his pain. But, in good earnest, as the
 arm when it is advanced to strike, if it miss the blow, and goes by the
 wind, it pains us; and as also, that, to make a pleasant prospect, the
 sight should not be lost and dilated in vague air, but have some bound and
 object to limit and circumscribe it at a reasonable distance.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ventus ut amittit vires, nisi robore densa
 Occurrant sylvae, spatio diffusus inani."

 ["As the wind loses its force diffused in void space, unless it in
 its strength encounters the thick wood."?Lucan, iii. 362.]
</pre>
 <p>
 So it seems that the soul, being transported and discomposed, turns its
 violence upon itself, if not supplied with something to oppose it, and
 therefore always requires an object at which to aim, and whereon to act.
 Plutarch says of those who are delighted with little dogs and monkeys,
 that the amorous part that is in us, for want of a legitimate object,
 rather than lie idle, does after that manner forge and create one false
 and frivolous. And we see that the soul, in its passions, inclines rather
 to deceive itself, by creating a false and fantastical a subject, even
 contrary to its own belief, than not to have something to work upon. After
 this manner brute beasts direct their fury to fall upon the stone or
 weapon that has hurt them, and with their teeth a even execute revenge
 upon themselves for the injury they have received from another:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Pannonis haud aliter, post ictum saevior ursa,
 Cui jaculum parva Lybis amentavit habena,
 Se rotat in vulnus, telumque irata receptum
 Impetit, et secum fugientem circuit hastam."

 ["So the she-bear, fiercer after the blow from the Lybian's thong-
 hurled dart, turns round upon the wound, and attacking the received
 spear, twists it, as she flies."?Lucan, vi. 220.]
</pre>
 <p>
 What causes of the misadventures that befall us do we not invent? what is
 it that we do not lay the fault to, right or wrong, that we may have
 something to quarrel with? It is not those beautiful tresses you tear, nor
 is it the white bosom that in your anger you so unmercifully beat, that
 with an unlucky bullet have slain your beloved brother; quarrel with
 something else. Livy, speaking of the Roman army in Spain, says that for
 the loss of the two brothers, their great captains:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Flere omnes repente, et offensare capita."

 ["All at once wept and tore their hair."-Livy, xxv. 37.]
</pre>
 <p>
 'Tis a common practice. And the philosopher Bion said pleasantly of the
 king, who by handsful pulled his hair off his head for sorrow, "Does this
 man think that baldness is a remedy for grief?"?[Cicero, Tusc.
 Quest., iii. 26.]?Who has not seen peevish gamesters chew and
 swallow the cards, and swallow the dice, in revenge for the loss of their
 money? Xerxes whipped the sea, and wrote a challenge to Mount Athos; Cyrus
 employed a whole army several days at work, to revenge himself of the
 river Gyndas, for the fright it had put him into in passing over it; and
 Caligula demolished a very beautiful palace for the pleasure his mother
 had once enjoyed there.

 understood here ironically, for the house was one in which she had

</pre>
 <p>
 I remember there was a story current, when I was a boy, that one of our
 neighbouring kings?[Probably Alfonso XI. of Castile]?having
 received a blow from the hand of God, swore he would be revenged, and in
 order to it, made proclamation that for ten years to come no one should
 pray to Him, or so much as mention Him throughout his dominions, or, so
 far as his authority went, believe in Him; by which they meant to paint
 not so much the folly as the vainglory of the nation of which this tale
 was told. They are vices that always go together, but in truth such
 actions as these have in them still more of presumption than want of wit.
 Augustus Caesar, having been tossed with a tempest at sea, fell to defying
 Neptune, and in the pomp of the Circensian games, to be revenged, deposed
 his statue from the place it had amongst the other deities. Wherein he was
 still less excusable than the former, and less than he was afterwards
 when, having lost a battle under Quintilius Varus in Germany, in rage and
 despair he went running his head against the wall, crying out, "O Varus!
 give me back my legions!" for these exceed all folly, forasmuch as impiety
 is joined therewith, invading God Himself, or at least Fortune, as if she
 had ears that were subject to our batteries; like the Thracians, who when
 it thunders or lightens, fall to shooting against heaven with Titanian
 vengeance, as if by flights of arrows they intended to bring God to
 reason. Though the ancient poet in Plutarch tells us?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Point ne se faut couroucer aux affaires,
 Il ne leur chault de toutes nos choleres."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V??WHETHER THE GOVERNOR OF A PLACE BESIEGED OUGHT
 HIMSELF TO GO OUT TO PARLEY
 </h2>
 <p>
 Quintus Marcius, the Roman legate in the war against Perseus, King of
 Macedon, to gain time wherein to reinforce his army, set on foot some
 overtures of accommodation, with which the king being lulled asleep,
 concluded a truce for some days, by this means giving his enemy
 opportunity and leisure to recruit his forces, which was afterwards the
 occasion of the king's final ruin. Yet the elder senators, mindful of
 their forefathers' manners, condemned this proceeding as degenerating from
 their ancient practice, which, they said, was to fight by valour, and not
 by artifice, surprises, and night-encounters; neither by pretended flight
 nor unexpected rallies to overcome their enemies; never making war till
 having first proclaimed it, and very often assigned both the hour and
 place of battle. Out of this generous principle it was that they delivered
 up to Pyrrhus his treacherous physician, and to the Etrurians their
 disloyal schoolmaster. This was, indeed, a procedure truly Roman, and
 nothing allied to the Grecian subtlety, nor to the Punic cunning, where it
 was reputed a victory of less glory to overcome by force than by fraud.
 Deceit may serve for a need, but he only confesses himself overcome who
 knows he is neither subdued by policy nor misadventure, but by dint of
 valour, man to man, in a fair and just war. It very well appears, by the
 discourse of these good old senators, that this fine sentence was not yet
 received amongst them.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Dolus, an virtus, quis in hoste requirat?"

 ["What matters whether by valour or by strategem we overcome the
 enemy?"?Aeneid, ii. 390]
</pre>
 <p>
 The Achaians, says Polybius, abhorred all manner of double-dealing in war,
 not reputing it a victory unless where the courage of the enemy was fairly
 subdued:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eam vir sanctus et sapiens sciet veram esse victoriam, quae, salva fide
 et integra dignitate, parabitur."?["An honest and prudent man will
 acknowledge that only to be a true victory which shall be obtained saving
 his own good faith and dignity."?Florus, i. 12.]?Says another:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Vosne velit, an me, regnare hera, quidve ferat,
 fors virtute experiamur."

 ["Whether you or I shall rule, or what shall happen, let us
 determine by valour."?Cicero, De Offic., i. 12]
</pre>
 <p>
 In the kingdom of Ternate, amongst those nations which we so broadly call
 barbarians, they have a custom never to commence war, till it be first
 proclaimed; adding withal an ample declaration of what means they have to
 do it with, with what and how many men, what ammunitions, and what, both
 offensive and defensive, arms; but also, that being done, if their enemies
 do not yield and come to an agreement, they conceive it lawful to employ
 without reproach in their wars any means which may help them to conquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ancient Florentines were so far from seeking to obtain any advantage
 over their enemies by surprise, that they always gave them a month's
 warning before they drew their army into the field, by the continual
 tolling of a bell they called Martinella.?[After St. Martin.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For what concerns ourselves, who are not so scrupulous in this affair, and
 who attribute the honour of the war to him who has the profit of it, and
 who after Lysander say, "Where the lion's skin is too short, we must eke
 it out with a bit from that of a fox"; the most usual occasions of
 surprise are derived from this practice, and we hold that there are no
 moments wherein a chief ought to be more circumspect, and to have his eye
 so much at watch, as those of parleys and treaties of accommodation; and
 it is, therefore, become a general rule amongst the martial men of these
 latter times, that a governor of a place never ought, in a time of siege,
 to go out to parley. It was for this that in our fathers' days the
 Seigneurs de Montmord and de l'Assigni, defending Mousson against the
 Count of Nassau, were so highly censured. But yet, as to this, it would be
 excusable in that governor who, going out, should, notwithstanding, do it
 in such manner that the safety and advantage should be on his side; as
 Count Guido di Rangone did at Reggio (if we are to believe Du Bellay, for
 Guicciardini says it was he himself) when the Seigneur de l'Escut
 approached to parley, who stepped so little away from his fort, that a
 disorder happening in the interim of parley, not only Monsieur de l'Escut
 and his party who were advanced with him, found themselves by much the
 weaker, insomuch that Alessandro Trivulcio was there slain, but he himself
 follow the Count, and, relying upon his honour, to secure himself from the
 danger of the shot within the walls of the town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eumenes, being shut up in the city of Nora by Antigonus, and by him
 importuned to come out to speak with him, as he sent him word it was fit
 he should to a greater man than himself, and one who had now an advantage
 over him, returned this noble answer. "Tell him," said he, "that I shall
 never think any man greater than myself whilst I have my sword in my
 hand," and would not consent to come out to him till first, according to
 his own demand, Antigonus had delivered him his own nephew Ptolomeus in
 hostage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet some have done very well in going out in person to parley, on the
 word of the assailant: witness Henry de Vaux, a cavalier of Champagne, who
 being besieged by the English in the Castle of Commercy, and Bartholomew
 de Brunes, who commanded at the Leaguer, having so sapped the greatest
 part of the castle without, that nothing remained but setting fire to the
 props to bury the besieged under the ruins, he requested the said Henry to
 come out to speak with him for his own good, which he did with three more
 in company; and, his ruin being made apparent to him, he conceived himself
 singularly obliged to his enemy, to whose discretion he and his garrison
 surrendered themselves; and fire being presently applied to the mine, the
 props no sooner began to fail, but the castle was immediately blown up

 <p>
 I could, and do, with great facility, rely upon the faith of another; but
 I should very unwillingly do it in such a case, as it should thereby be
 judged that it was rather an effect of my despair and want of courage than
 voluntarily and out of confidence and security in the faith of him with
 whom I had to do.

 CHAPTER VI??THAT THE HOUR OF PARLEY DANGEROUS
 </h2>
 <p>
 I saw, notwithstanding, lately at Mussidan, a place not far from my house,
 that those who were driven out thence by our army, and others of their
 party, highly complained of treachery, for that during a treaty of
 accommodation, and in the very interim that their deputies were treating,
 they were surprised and cut to pieces: a thing that, peradventure, in
 another age, might have had some colour of foul play; but, as I have just
 said, the practice of arms in these days is quite another thing, and there
 is now no confidence in an enemy excusable till the treaty is finally
 sealed; and even then the conqueror has enough to do to keep his word: so
 hazardous a thing it is to entrust the observation of the faith a man has
 engaged to a town that surrenders upon easy and favourable conditions, to
 the licence of a victorious army, and to give the soldier free entrance
 into it in the heat of blood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lucius AEmilius Regillus, the Roman praetor, having lost his time in
 attempting to take the city of Phocaea by force, by reason of the singular
 valour wherewith the inhabitants defended themselves, conditioned, at
 last, to receive them as friends to the people of Rome, and to enter the
 town, as into a confederate city, without any manner of hostility, of
 which he gave them all assurance; but having, for the greater pomp,
 brought his whole army in with him, it was no more in his power, with all
 the endeavour he could use, to restrain his people: so that, avarice and
 revenge trampling under foot both his authority and all military
 discipline, he there saw a considerable part of the city sacked and ruined
 before his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cleomenes was wont to say, "that what mischief soever a man could do his
 enemy in time of war was above justice, and nothing accountable to it in
 the sight of gods and men." And so, having concluded a truce with those of
 Argos for seven days, the third night after he fell upon them when they
 were all buried in sleep, and put them to the sword, alleging that there
 had no nights been mentioned in the truce; but the gods punished this
 subtle perfidy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a time of parley also; and while the citizens were relying upon their
 safety warrant, the city of Casilinum was taken by surprise, and that even
 in the age of the justest captains and the most perfect Roman military
 discipline; for it is not said that it is not lawful for us, in time and
 place, to make advantage of our enemies' want of understanding, as well as
 their want of courage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, doubtless, war has naturally many privileges that appear reasonable
 even to the prejudice of reason. And therefore here the rule fails,
 "Neminem id agere ut ex alte rius praedetur inscitia."?["No one should
 preys upon another's folly."?Cicero, De Offic., iii. 17.]?But
 I am astonished at the great liberty allowed by Xenophon in such cases,
 and that both by precept and by the example of several exploits of his
 complete emperor; an author of very great authority, I confess, in those
 affairs, as being in his own person both a great captain and a philosopher
 of the first form of Socrates' disciples; and yet I cannot consent to such
 a measure of licence as he dispenses in all things and places.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur d'Aubigny, besieging Capua, and after having directed a furious
 battery against it, Signor Fabricio Colonna, governor of the town, having
 from a bastion begun to parley, and his soldiers in the meantime being a
 little more remiss in their guard, our people entered the place at
 unawares, and put them all to the sword. And of later memory, at Yvoy,
 Signor Juliano Romero having played that part of a novice to go out to
 parley with the Constable, at his return found his place taken. But, that
 we might not scape scot-free, the Marquess of Pescara having laid siege to
 Genoa, where Duke Ottaviano Fregosa commanded under our protection, and
 the articles betwixt them being so far advanced that it was looked upon as
 a done thing, and upon the point to be concluded, the Spaniards in the
 meantime having slipped in, made use of this treachery as an absolute
 victory. And since, at Ligny, in Barrois, where the Count de Brienne
 commanded, the emperor having in his own person beleaguered that place,
 and Bertheville, the said Count's lieutenant, going out to parley, whilst
 he was capitulating the town was taken.

 Vincasi o per fortuna, o per ingegno,"

 ["Victory is ever worthy of praise, whether obtained by valour or

</pre>
 <p>
 But the philosopher Chrysippus was of another opinion, wherein I also
 concur; for he was used to say that those who run a race ought to employ
 all the force they have in what they are about, and to run as fast as they
 can; but that it is by no means fair in them to lay any hand upon their
 adversary to stop him, nor to set a leg before him to throw him down. And
 yet more generous was the answer of that great Alexander to Polypercon who
 was persuading him to take the advantage of the night's obscurity to fall
 upon Darius. "By no means," said be; "it is not for such a man as I am to
 steal a victory, 'Malo me fortunae poeniteat, quam victoria pudeat.'"?["I
 had rather complain of ill-fortune than be ashamed of victory." Quint.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII??THAT THE INTENTION IS JUDGE OF OUR ACTIONS
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Tis a saying, "That death discharges us of all our obligations." I know
 some who have taken it in another sense. Henry VII., King of England,
 articled with Don Philip, son to Maximilian the emperor, or (to place him
 more honourably) father to the Emperor Charles V., that the said Philip
 should deliver up the Duke of Suffolk of the White Rose, his enemy, who
 was fled into the Low Countries, into his hands; which Philip accordingly
 did, but upon condition, nevertheless, that Henry should attempt nothing
 against the life of the said Duke; but coming to die, the king in his last
 will commanded his son to put him to death immediately after his decease.
 And lately, in the tragedy that the Duke of Alva presented to us in the
 persons of the Counts Horn and Egmont at Brussels, ?[Decapitated 4th
 June 1568]?there were very remarkable passages, and one amongst the
 rest, that Count Egmont (upon the security of whose word and faith Count
 Horn had come and surrendered himself to the Duke of Alva) earnestly
 entreated that he might first mount the scaffold, to the end that death
 might disengage him from the obligation he had passed to the other. In
 which case, methinks, death did not acquit the former of his promise, and
 that the second was discharged from it without dying. We cannot be bound
 beyond what we are able to perform, by reason that effect and performance
 are not at all in our power, and that, indeed, we are masters of nothing
 but the will, in which, by necessity, all the rules and whole duty of
 mankind are founded and established: therefore Count Egmont, conceiving
 his soul and will indebted to his promise, although he had not the power
 to make it good, had doubtless been absolved of his duty, even though he
 had outlived the other; but the King of England wilfully and premeditately
 breaking his faith, was no more to be excused for deferring the execution
 of his infidelity till after his death than the mason in Herodotus, who
 having inviolably, during the time of his life, kept the secret of the
 treasure of the King of Egypt, his master, at his death discovered it to
 his children.?[Herod., ii. 121.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have taken notice of several in my time, who, convicted by their
 consciences of unjustly detaining the goods of another, have endeavoured
 to make amends by their will, and after their decease; but they had as
 good do nothing, as either in taking so much time in so pressing an
 affair, or in going about to remedy a wrong with so little dissatisfaction
 or injury to themselves. They owe, over and above, something of their own;
 and by how much their payment is more strict and incommodious to
 themselves, by so much is their restitution more just meritorious.
 Penitency requires penalty; but they yet do worse than these, who reserve
 the animosity against their neighbour to the last gasp, having concealed
 it during their life; wherein they manifest little regard of their own
 honour, irritating the party offended in their memory; and less to their
 the power, even out of to make their malice die with them, but extending
 the life of their hatred even beyond their own. Unjust judges, who defer
 judgment to a time wherein they can have no knowledge of the cause! For my
 part, I shall take care, if I can, that my death discover nothing that my
 life has not first and openly declared.

 CHAPTER VIII??OF IDLENESS
 </h2>
 <p>
 As we see some grounds that have long lain idle and untilled, when grown
 rich and fertile by rest, to abound with and spend their virtue in the
 product of innumerable sorts of weeds and wild herbs that are
 unprofitable, and that to make them perform their true office, we are to
 cultivate and prepare them for such seeds as are proper for our service;
 and as we see women that, without knowledge of man, do sometimes of
 themselves bring forth inanimate and formless lumps of flesh, but that to
 cause a natural and perfect generation they are to be husbanded with
 another kind of seed: even so it is with minds, which if not applied to
 some certain study that may fix and restrain them, run into a thousand
 extravagances, eternally roving here and there in the vague expanse of the
 imagination?

 When I lately retired to my own house, with a resolution, as much as
 possibly I could, to avoid all manner of concern in affairs, and to spend
 in privacy and repose the little remainder of time I have to live, I
 fancied I could not more oblige my mind than to suffer it at full leisure
 to entertain and divert itself, which I now hoped it might henceforth do,
 as being by time become more settled and mature; but I find?

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IX??OF LIARS
 </h2>
 <p>
 There is not a man living whom it would so little become to speak from
 memory as myself, for I have scarcely any at all, and do not think that
 the world has another so marvellously treacherous as mine. My other
 faculties are all sufficiently ordinary and mean; but in this I think
 myself very rare and singular, and deserving to be thought famous. Besides
 the natural inconvenience I suffer by it (for, certes, the necessary use
 of memory considered, Plato had reason when he called it a great and
 powerful goddess), in my country, when they would say a man has no sense,
 they say, such an one has no memory; and when I complain of the defect of
 mine, they do not believe me, and reprove me, as though I accused myself
 for a fool: not discerning the difference betwixt memory and
 understanding, which is to make matters still worse for me. But they do me
 wrong; for experience, rather, daily shows us, on the contrary, that a
 strong memory is commonly coupled with infirm judgment. They do, me,
 moreover (who am so perfect in nothing as in friendship), a great wrong in
 this, that they make the same words which accuse my infirmity, represent
 me for an ungrateful person; they bring my affections into question upon
 the account of my memory, and from a natural imperfection, make out a
 defect of conscience. "He has forgot," says one, "this request, or that
 promise; he no more remembers his friends; he has forgot to say or do, or
 conceal such and such a thing, for my sake." And, truly, I am apt enough
 to forget many things, but to neglect anything my friend has given me in
 charge, I never do it. And it should be enough, methinks, that I feel the
 misery and inconvenience of it, without branding me with malice, a vice so
 contrary to my humour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, I derive these comforts from my infirmity: first, that it is an
 evil from which principally I have found reason to correct a worse, that
 would easily enough have grown upon me, namely, ambition; the defect being
 intolerable in those who take upon them public affairs. That, like
 examples in the progress of nature demonstrate to us, she has fortified me
 in my other faculties proportionably as she has left me unfurnished in
 this; I should otherwise have been apt implicitly to have reposed my mind
 and judgment upon the bare report of other men, without ever setting them
 to work upon their own force, had the inventions and opinions of others
 been ever been present with me by the benefit of memory. That by this
 means I am not so talkative, for the magazine of the memory is ever better
 furnished with matter than that of the invention. Had mine been faithful
 to me, I had ere this deafened all my friends with my babble, the subjects
 themselves arousing and stirring up the little faculty I have of handling
 and employing them, heating and distending my discourse, which were a
 pity: as I have observed in several of my intimate friends, who, as their
 memories supply them with an entire and full view of things, begin their
 narrative so far back, and crowd it with so many impertinent
 circumstances, that though the story be good in itself, they make a shift
 to spoil it; and if otherwise, you are either to curse the strength of
 their memory or the weakness of their judgment: and it is a hard thing to
 close up a discourse, and to cut it short, when you have once started;
 there is nothing wherein the force of a horse is so much seen as in a
 round and sudden stop. I see even those who are pertinent enough, who
 would, but cannot stop short in their career; for whilst they are seeking
 out a handsome period to conclude with, they go on at random, straggling
 about upon impertinent trivialities, as men staggering upon weak legs.
 But, above all, old men who retain the memory of things past, and forget
 how often they have told them, are dangerous company; and I have known
 stories from the mouth of a man of very great quality, otherwise very
 pleasant in themselves, become very wearisome by being repeated a hundred
 times over and over again to the same people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Secondly, that, by this means, I the less remember the injuries I have
 received; insomuch that, as the ancient said,?[Cicero, Pro Ligar. c.
 12.]?I should have a register of injuries, or a prompter, as Darius,
 who, that he might not forget the offence he had received from those of
 Athens, so oft as he sat down to dinner, ordered one of his pages three
 times to repeat in his ear, "Sir, remember the Athenians";?[Herod.,
 v. 105.]?and then, again, the places which I revisit, and the books
 I read over again, still smile upon me with a fresh novelty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is not without good reason said "that he who has not a good memory
 should never take upon him the trade of lying." I know very well that the
 grammarians?[Nigidius, Aulus Gellius, xi. ii; Nonius, v. 80.]?
 distinguish betwixt an untruth and a lie, and say that to tell an untruth
 is to tell a thing that is false, but that we ourselves believe to be
 true; and that the definition of the word to lie in Latin, from which our
 French is taken, is to tell a thing which we know in our conscience to be
 untrue; and it is of this last sort of liars only that I now speak. Now,
 these do either wholly contrive and invent the untruths they utter, or so
 alter and disguise a true story that it ends in a lie. When they disguise
 and often alter the same story, according to their own fancy, 'tis very
 hard for them, at one time or another, to escape being trapped, by reason
 that the real truth of the thing, having first taken possession of the
 memory, and being there lodged impressed by the medium of knowledge and
 science, it will be difficult that it should not represent itself to the
 imagination, and shoulder out falsehood, which cannot there have so sure
 and settled footing as the other; and the circumstances of the first true
 knowledge evermore running in their minds, will be apt to make them forget
 those that are illegitimate, and only, forged by their own fancy. In what
 they, wholly invent, forasmuch as there is no contrary impression to
 jostle their invention there seems to be less danger of tripping; and yet
 even this by reason it is a vain body and without any hold, is very apt to
 escape the memory, if it be not well assured. Of which I had very pleasant
 experience, at the expense of such as profess only to form and accommodate
 their speech to the affair they have in hand, or to humour of the great
 folks to whom they are speaking; for the circumstances to which these men
 stick not to enslave their faith and conscience being subject to several
 changes, their language must vary accordingly: whence it happens that of
 the same thing they tell one man that it is this, and another that it is
 that, giving it several colours; which men, if they once come to confer
 notes, and find out the cheat, what becomes of this fine art? To which may
 be added, that they must of necessity very often ridiculously trap
 themselves; for what memory can be sufficient to retain so many different
 shapes as they have forged upon one and the same subject? I have known
 many in my time very ambitious of the repute of this fine wit; but they do
 not see that if they have the reputation of it, the effect can no longer
 be.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In plain truth, lying is an accursed vice. We are not men, nor have other
 tie upon one another, but by our word. If we did but discover the horror
 and gravity of it, we should pursue it with fire and sword, and more
 justly than other crimes. I see that parents commonly, and with
 indiscretion enough, correct their children for little innocent faults,
 and torment them for wanton tricks, that have neither impression nor
 consequence; whereas, in my opinion, lying only, and, which is of
 something a lower form, obstinacy, are the faults which are to be severely
 whipped out of them, both in their infancy and in their progress,
 otherwise they grow up and increase with them; and after a tongue has once
 got the knack of lying, 'tis not to be imagined how impossible it is to
 reclaim it whence it comes to pass that we see some, who are otherwise
 very honest men, so subject and enslaved to this vice. I have an honest
 lad to my tailor, whom I never knew guilty of one truth, no, not when it
 had been to his advantage. If falsehood had, like truth, but one face
 only, we should be upon better terms; for we should then take for certain
 the contrary to what the liar says: but the reverse of truth has a hundred
 thousand forms, and a field indefinite, without bound or limit. The
 Pythagoreans make good to be certain and finite, and evil, infinite and
 uncertain. There are a thousand ways to miss the white, there is only one
 to hit it. For my own part, I have this vice in so great horror, that I am
 not sure I could prevail with my conscience to secure myself from the most
 manifest and extreme danger by an impudent and solemn lie. An ancient
 father says "that a dog we know is better company than a man whose
 language we do not understand."

 ["As a foreigner cannot be said to supply us the place of a man."

</pre>
 <p>
 And how much less sociable is false speaking than silence?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 King Francis I. vaunted that he had by this means nonplussed Francesco
 Taverna, ambassador of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, a man very famous
 for his science in talking in those days. This gentleman had been sent to
 excuse his master to his Majesty about a thing of very great consequence,
 which was this: the King, still to maintain some intelligence with Italy,
 out of which he had lately been driven, and particularly with the duchy of
 Milan, had thought it convenient to have a gentleman on his behalf to be
 with that Duke: an ambassador in effect, but in outward appearance a
 private person who pretended to reside there upon his own particular
 affairs; for the Duke, much more depending upon the Emperor, especially at
 a time when he was in a treaty of marriage with his niece, daughter to the
 King of Denmark, who is now dowager of Lorraine, could not manifest any
 practice and conference with us without his great interest. For this
 commission one Merveille, a Milanese gentleman, and an equerry to the
 King, being thought very fit, was accordingly despatched thither with
 private credentials, and instructions as ambassador, and with other
 letters of recommendation to the Duke about his own private concerns, the
 better to mask and colour the business; and was so long in that court,
 that the Emperor at last had some inkling of his real employment there;
 which was the occasion of what followed after, as we suppose; which was,
 that under pretence of some murder, his trial was in two days despatched,
 and his head in the night struck off in prison. Messire Francesco being
 come, and prepared with a long counterfeit history of the affair (for the
 King had applied himself to all the princes of Christendom, as well as to
 the Duke himself, to demand satisfaction), had his audience at the morning
 council; where, after he had for the support of his cause laid open
 several plausible justifications of the fact, that his master had never
 looked upon this Merveille for other than a private gentleman and his own
 subject, who was there only in order to his own business, neither had he
 ever lived under any other aspect; absolutely disowning that he had ever
 heard he was one of the King's household or that his Majesty so much as
 knew him, so far was he from taking him for an ambassador: the King, in
 his turn, pressing him with several objections and demands, and
 challenging him on all sides, tripped him up at last by asking, why, then,
 the execution was performed by night, and as it were by stealth? At which
 the poor confounded ambassador, the more handsomely to disengage himself,
 made answer, that the Duke would have been very loth, out of respect to
 his Majesty, that such an execution should have been performed by day. Any
 one may guess if he was not well rated when he came home, for having so
 grossly tripped in the presence of a prince of so delicate a nostril as
 King Francis.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pope Julius II. having sent an ambassador to the King of England to
 animate him against King Francis, the ambassador having had his audience,
 and the King, before he would give an answer, insisting upon the
 difficulties he should find in setting on foot so great a preparation as
 would be necessary to attack so potent a King, and urging some reasons to
 that effect, the ambassador very unseasonably replied that he had also
 himself considered the same difficulties, and had represented them to the
 Pope. From which saying of his, so directly opposite to the thing
 propounded and the business he came about, which was immediately to incite
 him to war, the King of England first derived the argument (which he
 afterward found to be true), that this ambassador, in his own mind, was on
 the side of the French; of which having advertised his master, his estate
 at his return home was confiscated, and he himself very narrowly escaped
 the losing of his head.?[Erasmi Op. (1703), iv. col. 684.]

 CHAPTER X??OF QUICK OR SLOW SPEECH
 </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Onc ne furent a touts toutes graces donnees."

 ["All graces were never yet given to any one man."?A verse
 in one of La Brebis' Sonnets.]
</pre>
 <p>
 So we see in the gift of eloquence, wherein some have such a facility and
 promptness, and that which we call a present wit so easy, that they are
 ever ready upon all occasions, and never to be surprised; and others more
 heavy and slow, never venture to utter anything but what they have long
 premeditated, and taken great care and pains to fit and prepare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, as we teach young ladies those sports and exercises which are most
 proper to set out the grace and beauty of those parts wherein their
 chiefest ornament and perfection lie, so it should be in these two
 advantages of eloquence, to which the lawyers and preachers of our age
 seem principally to pretend. If I were worthy to advise, the slow speaker,
 methinks, should be more proper for the pulpit, and the other for the bar:
 and that because the employment of the first does naturally allow him all
 the leisure he can desire to prepare himself, and besides, his career is
 performed in an even and unintermitted line, without stop or interruption;
 whereas the pleader's business and interest compels him to enter the lists
 upon all occasions, and the unexpected objections and replies of his
 adverse party jostle him out of his course, and put him, upon the instant,
 to pump for new and extempore answers and defences. Yet, at the interview
 betwixt Pope Clement and King Francis at Marseilles, it happened, quite
 contrary, that Monsieur Poyet, a man bred up all his life at the bar, and
 in the highest repute for eloquence, having the charge of making the
 harangue to the Pope committed to him, and having so long meditated on it
 beforehand, as, so they said, to have brought it ready made along with him
 from Paris; the very day it was to have been pronounced, the Pope, fearing
 something might be said that might give offence to the other princes'
 ambassadors who were there attending on him, sent to acquaint the King
 with the argument which he conceived most suiting to the time and place,
 but, by chance, quite another thing to that Monsieur de Poyet had taken so
 much pains about: so that the fine speech he had prepared was of no use,
 and he was upon the instant to contrive another; which finding himself
 unable to do, Cardinal du Bellay was constrained to perform that office.
 The pleader's part is, doubtless, much harder than that of the preacher;
 and yet, in my opinion, we see more passable lawyers than preachers, at
 all events in France. It should seem that the nature of wit is to have its
 operation prompt and sudden, and that of judgment to have it more
 deliberate and more slow. But he who remains totally silent, for want of
 leisure to prepare himself to speak well, and he also whom leisure does
 noways benefit to better speaking, are equally unhappy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis said of Severus Cassius that he spoke best extempore, that he stood
 more obliged to fortune than to his own diligence; that it was an
 advantage to him to be interrupted in speaking, and that his adversaries
 were afraid to nettle him, lest his anger should redouble his eloquence. I
 know, experimentally, the disposition of nature so impatient of tedious
 and elaborate premeditation, that if it do not go frankly and gaily to
 work, it can perform nothing to purpose. We say of some compositions that
 they stink of oil and of the lamp, by reason of a certain rough harshness
 that laborious handling imprints upon those where it has been employed.
 But besides this, the solicitude of doing well, and a certain striving and
 contending of a mind too far strained and overbent upon its undertaking,
 breaks and hinders itself like water, that by force of its own pressing
 violence and abundance, cannot find a ready issue through the neck of a
 bottle or a narrow sluice. In this condition of nature, of which I am now
 speaking, there is this also, that it would not be disordered and
 stimulated with such passions as the fury of Cassius (for such a motion
 would be too violent and rude); it would not be jostled, but solicited; it
 would be roused and heated by unexpected, sudden, and accidental
 occasions. If it be left to itself, it flags and languishes; agitation
 only gives it grace and vigour. I am always worst in my own possession,
 and when wholly at my own disposition: accident has more title to anything
 that comes from me than I; occasion, company, and even the very rising and
 falling of my own voice, extract more from my fancy than I can find, when
 I sound and employ it by myself. By which means, the things I say are
 better than those I write, if either were to be preferred, where neither
 is worth anything. This, also, befalls me, that I do not find myself where
 I seek myself, and I light upon things more by chance than by any
 inquisition of my own judgment. I perhaps sometimes hit upon something
 when I write, that seems quaint and sprightly to me, though it will appear
 dull and heavy to another.?But let us leave these fine compliments;
 every one talks thus of himself according to his talent. But when I come
 to speak, I am already so lost that I know not what I was about to say,
 and in such cases a stranger often finds it out before me. If I should
 make erasure so often as this inconvenience befalls me, I should make
 clean work; occasion will, at some other time, lay it as visible to me as
 the light, and make me wonder what I should stick at.

 CHAPTER XI??OF PROGNOSTICATIONS
 </h2>
 <p>
 For what concerns oracles, it is certain that a good while before the
 coming of Jesus Christ they had begun to lose their credit; for we see
 that Cicero troubled to find out the cause of their decay, and he has
 these words:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Cur isto modo jam oracula Delphis non eduntur,
 non modo nostro aetate, sed jam diu; ut nihil
 possit esse contemptius?"

 ["What is the reason that the oracles at Delphi are no longer
 uttered: not merely in this age of ours, but for a long time past,
 insomuch that nothing is more in contempt?"
 ?Cicero, De Divin., ii. 57.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But as to the other prognostics, calculated from the anatomy of beasts at
 sacrifices (to which purpose Plato does, in part, attribute the natural
 constitution of the intestines of the beasts themselves), the scraping of
 poultry, the flight of birds?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aves quasdam . . . rerum augurandarum
 causa natas esse putamus."

 ["We think some sorts of birds are purposely created to serve
 the purposes of augury."?Cicero, De Natura Deor., ii. 64.]
</pre>
 <p>
 claps of thunder, the overflowing of rivers?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Multa cernunt Aruspices, multa Augures provident,
 multa oraculis declarantur, multa vaticinationibus,
 multa somniis, multa portentis."

 ["The Aruspices discern many things, the Augurs foresee many things,
 many things are announced by oracles, many by vaticinations, many by
 dreams, many by portents."?Cicero, De Natura Deor., ii. 65.]
</pre>
 <p>
 ?and others of the like nature, upon which antiquity founded most of
 their public and private enterprises, our religion has totally abolished
 them. And although there yet remain amongst us some practices of
 divination from the stars, from spirits, from the shapes and complexions
 of men, from dreams and the like (a notable example of the wild curiosity
 of our nature to grasp at and anticipate future things, as if we had not
 enough to do to digest the present)?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Cur hanc tibi, rector Olympi,
 Sollicitis visum mortalibus addere curam,
 Noscant venturas ut dira per omina clades?...
 Sit subitum, quodcumque paras; sit coeca futuri
 Mens hominum fati, liceat sperare timenti."

 ["Why, ruler of Olympus, hast thou to anxious mortals thought fit to
 add this care, that they should know by, omens future slaughter?...
 Let whatever thou art preparing be sudden. Let the mind of men be
 blind to fate in store; let it be permitted to the timid to hope."
 ?Lucan, ii. 14]

 "Ne utile quidem est scire quid futurum sit;
 miserum est enim, nihil proficientem angi,"

 ["It is useless to know what shall come to pass; it is a miserable
 thing to be tormented to no purpose."
 ?Cicero, De Natura Deor., iii. 6.]
</pre>
 <p>
 yet are they of much less authority now than heretofore. Which makes so
 much more remarkable the example of Francesco, Marquis of Saluzzo, who
 being lieutenant to King Francis I. in his ultramontane army, infinitely
 favoured and esteemed in our court, and obliged to the king's bounty for
 the marquisate itself, which had been forfeited by his brother; and as to
 the rest, having no manner of provocation given him to do it, and even his
 own affection opposing any such disloyalty, suffered himself to be so
 terrified, as it was confidently reported, with the fine prognostics that
 were spread abroad everywhere in favour of the Emperor Charles V., and to
 our disadvantage (especially in Italy, where these foolish prophecies were
 so far believed, that at Rome great sums of money were ventured out upon
 return of greater, when the prognostics came to pass, so certain they made
 themselves of our ruin), that, having often bewailed, to those of his
 acquaintance who were most intimate with him, the mischiefs that he saw
 would inevitably fall upon the Crown of France and the friends he had in
 that court, he revolted and turned to the other side; to his own
 misfortune, nevertheless, what constellation soever governed at that time.
 But he carried himself in this affair like a man agitated by divers
 passions; for having both towns and forces in his hands, the enemy's army
 under Antonio de Leyva close by him, and we not at all suspecting his
 design, it had been in his power to have done more than he did; for we
 lost no men by this infidelity of his, nor any town, but Fossano only, and
 that after a long siege and a brave defence.?(1536)
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Prudens futuri temporis exitum
 Caliginosa nocte premit Deus,
 Ridetque, si mortalis ultra
 Fas trepidat."

 ["A wise God covers with thick night the path of the future, and
 laughs at the man who alarms himself without reason."
 ?Hor., Od., iii. 29.]

 "Ille potens sui
 Laetusque deget, cui licet in diem
 Dixisse vixi! cras vel atra
 Nube polum pater occupato,
 Vel sole puro."

 ["He lives happy and master of himself who can say as each day
 passes on, 'I HAVE LIVED:' whether to-morrow our Father shall give
 us a clouded sky or a clear day."?Hor., Od., iii. 29]

 "Laetus in praesens animus; quod ultra est,
 Oderit curare."

 ["A mind happy, cheerful in the present state, will take good care
 not to think of what is beyond it."?Ibid., ii. 25]
</pre>
 <p>
 And those who take this sentence in a contrary sense interpret it amiss:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ista sic reciprocantur, ut et si divinatio sit,
 dii sint; et si dii lint, sit divinatio."

 ["These things are so far reciprocal that if there be divination,
 there must be deities; and if deities, divination."?Cicero, De
 Divin., i. 6.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Much more wisely Pacuvius?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nam istis, qui linguam avium intelligunt,
 Plusque ex alieno jecore sapiunt, quam ex suo,
 Magis audiendum, quam auscultandum, censeo."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["As to those who understand the language of birds, and who rather
 consult the livers of animals other than their own, I had rather
 hear them than attend to them."
 ?Cicero, De Divin., i. 57, ex Pacuvio]
</pre>
 <p>
 The so celebrated art of divination amongst the Tuscans took its beginning
 thus: A labourer striking deep with his cutter into the earth, saw the
 demigod Tages ascend, with an infantine aspect, but endued with a mature
 and senile wisdom. Upon the rumour of which, all the people ran to see the
 sight, by whom his words and science, containing the principles and means
 to attain to this art, were recorded, and kept for many ages.?[Cicero,
 De Devina, ii. 23]?A birth suitable to its progress; I, for my part,
 should sooner regulate my affairs by the chance of a die than by such idle
 and vain dreams. And, indeed, in all republics, a good share of the
 government has ever been referred to chance. Plato, in the civil regimen
 that he models according to his own fancy, leaves to it the decision of
 several things of very great importance, and will, amongst other things,
 that marriages should be appointed by lot; attributing so great importance
 to this accidental choice as to ordain that the children begotten in such
 wedlock be brought up in the country, and those begotten in any other be
 thrust out as spurious and base; yet so, that if any of those exiles,
 notwithstanding, should, peradventure, in growing up give any good hope of
 himself, he might be recalled, as, also, that such as had been retained,
 should be exiled, in case they gave little expectation of themselves in
 their early growth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see some who are mightily given to study and comment upon their
 almanacs, and produce them to us as an authority when anything has fallen
 out pat; and, for that matter, it is hardly possible but that these
 alleged authorities sometimes stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite
 number of lies.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quis est enim, qui totum diem jaculans
 non aliquando collineet?"

 ["For who shoots all day at butts that does not sometimes hit the
 white?"?Cicero, De Divin., ii. 59.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I think never the better of them for some such accidental hit. There would
 be more certainty in it if there were a rule and a truth of always lying.
 Besides, nobody records their flimflams and false prognostics, forasmuch
 as they are infinite and common; but if they chop upon one truth, that
 carries a mighty report, as being rare, incredible, and prodigious. So
 Diogenes, surnamed the Atheist, answered him in Samothrace, who, showing
 him in the temple the several offerings and stories in painting of those
 who had escaped shipwreck, said to him, "Look, you who think the gods have
 no care of human things, what do you say to so many persons preserved from
 death by their especial favour?" "Why, I say," answered he, "that their
 pictures are not here who were cast away, who are by much the greater
 number."?[Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 37.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cicero observes that of all the philosophers who have acknowledged a
 deity, Xenophanes the Colophonian only has endeavoured to eradicate all
 manner of divination?[Cicero, De Divin., i. 3.]?; which makes
 it the less a wonder if we have now and then seen some of our princes,
 sometimes to their own cost, rely too much upon these vanities. I had
 given anything with my own eyes to see those two great marvels, the book
 of Joachim the Calabrian abbot, which foretold all the future Popes, their
 names and qualities; and that of the Emperor Leo, which prophesied all the
 emperors and patriarchs of Greece. This I have been an eyewitness of, that
 in public confusions, men astonished at their fortune, have abandoned
 their own reason, superstitiously to seek out in the stars the ancient
 causes and menaces of the present mishaps, and in my time have been so
 strangely successful in it, as to make me believe that this being an
 amusement of sharp and volatile wits, those who have been versed in this
 knack of unfolding and untying riddles, are capable, in any sort of
 writing, to find out what they desire. But above all, that which gives
 them the greatest room to play in, is the obscure, ambiguous, and
 fantastic gibberish of the prophetic canting, where their authors deliver
 nothing of clear sense, but shroud all in riddle, to the end that
 posterity may interpret and apply it according to its own fancy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Socrates demon might, perhaps, be no other but a certain impulsion of the
 will, which obtruded itself upon him without the advice or consent of his
 judgment; and in a soul so enlightened as his was, and so prepared by a
 continual exercise of wisdom-and virtue, 'tis to be supposed those
 inclinations of his, though sudden and undigested, were very important and
 worthy to be followed. Every one finds in himself some image of such
 agitations, of a prompt, vehement, and fortuitous opinion; and I may well
 allow them some authority, who attribute so little to our prudence, and
 who also myself have had some, weak in reason, but violent in persuasion
 and dissuasion, which were most frequent with Socrates,?[Plato, in
 his account of Theages the Pythagorean]?by which I have suffered
 myself to be carried away so fortunately, and so much to my own advantage,
 that they might have been judged to have had something in them of a divine
 inspiration.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XII??OF CONSTANCY
 </h2>
 <p>
 The law of resolution and constancy does not imply that we ought not, as
 much as in us lies, to decline and secure ourselves from the mischiefs and
 inconveniences that threaten us; nor, consequently, that we shall not fear
 lest they should surprise us: on the contrary, all decent and honest ways
 and means of securing ourselves from harms, are not only permitted, but,
 moreover, commendable, and the business of constancy chiefly is, bravely
 to stand to, and stoutly to suffer those inconveniences which are not
 possibly to be avoided. So that there is no supple motion of body, nor any
 movement in the handling of arms, how irregular or ungraceful soever, that
 we need condemn, if they serve to protect us from the blow that is made
 against us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several very warlike nations have made use of a retreating and flying way
 of fight as a thing of singular advantage, and, by so doing, have made
 their backs more dangerous to their enemies than their faces. Of which
 kind of fighting the Turks still retain something in their practice of
 arms; and Socrates, in Plato, laughs at Laches, who had defined fortitude
 to be a standing firm in the ranks against the enemy. "What!" says he,
 "would it, then, be a reputed cowardice to overcome them by giving
 ground?" urging, at the same time, the authority of Homer, who commends in
 AEneas the science of flight. And whereas Laches, considering better of
 it, admits the practice as to the Scythians, and, in general, all cavalry
 whatever, he again attacks him with the example of the Lacedaemonian foot?a
 nation of all other the most obstinate in maintaining their ground?who,
 in the battle of Plataea, not being able to break into the Persian
 phalanx, bethought themselves to disperse and retire, that by the enemy
 supposing they fled, they might break and disunite that vast body of men
 in the pursuit, and by that stratagem obtained the victory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As for the Scythians, 'tis said of them, that when Darius went his
 expedition to subdue them, he sent, by a herald, highly to reproach their
 king, that he always retired before him and declined a battle; to which
 Idanthyrses,?[Herod., iv. 127.]?for that was his name,
 returned answer, that it was not for fear of him, or of any man living,
 that he did so, but that it was the way of marching in practice with his
 nation, who had neither tilled fields, cities, nor houses to defend, or to
 fear the enemy should make any advantage of but that if he had such a
 stomach to fight, let him but come to view their ancient places of
 sepulture, and there he should have his fill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nevertheless, as to cannon-shot, when a body of men are drawn up in the
 face of a train of artillery, as the occasion of war often requires, it is
 unhandsome to quit their post to avoid the danger, forasmuch as by reason
 of its violence and swiftness we account it inevitable; and many a one, by
 ducking, stepping aside, and such other motions of fear, has been, at all
 events, sufficiently laughed at by his companions. And yet, in the
 expedition that the Emperor Charles V. made against us into Provence, the
 Marquis de Guast going to reconnoitre the city of Arles, and advancing out
 of the cover of a windmill, under favour of which he had made his
 approach, was perceived by the Seigneurs de Bonneval and the Seneschal of
 Agenois, who were walking upon the 'theatre aux ayenes'; who having shown
 him to the Sieur de Villiers, commissary of the artillery, he pointed a
 culverin so admirably well, and levelled it so exactly right against him,
 that had not the Marquis, seeing fire given to it, slipped aside, it was
 certainly concluded the shot had taken him full in the body. And, in like
 manner, some years before, Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, and father
 to the queen-mother?[Catherine de' Medici, mother of Henry III.]?laying
 siege to Mondolfo, a place in the territories of the Vicariat in Italy,
 seeing the cannoneer give fire to a piece that pointed directly against
 him, it was well for him that he ducked, for otherwise the shot, that only
 razed the top of his head, had doubtless hit him full in the breast. To
 say truth, I do not think that these evasions are performed upon the
 account of judgment; for how can any man living judge of high or low aim
 on so sudden an occasion? And it is much more easy to believe that fortune
 favoured their apprehension, and that it might be as well at another time
 to make them face the danger, as to seek to avoid it. For my own part, I
 confess I cannot forbear starting when the rattle of a harquebuse thunders
 in my ears on a sudden, and in a place where I am not to expect it, which
 I have also observed in others, braver fellows than I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Neither do the Stoics pretend that the soul of their philosopher need be
 proof against the first visions and fantasies that surprise him; but, as
 to a natural subjection, consent that he should tremble at the terrible
 noise of thunder, or the sudden clatter of some falling ruin, and be
 affrighted even to paleness and convulsion; and so in other passions,
 provided his judgment remain sound and entire, and that the seat of his
 reason suffer no concussion nor alteration, and that he yield no consent
 to his fright and discomposure. To him who is not a philosopher, a fright
 is the same thing in the first part of it, but quite another thing in the
 second; for the impression of passions does not remain superficially in
 him, but penetrates farther, even to the very seat of reason, infecting
 and corrupting it, so that he judges according to his fear, and conforms
 his behaviour to it. In this verse you may see the true state of the wise
 Stoic learnedly and plainly expressed:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Mens immota manet; lachrymae volvuntur inanes."

 ["Though tears flow, the mind remains unmoved."
 ?Virgil, AEneid, iv. 449]

 mind, but he moderates them.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIII??THE CEREMONY OF THE INTERVIEW OF PRINCES
 </h2>
 <p>
 There is no subject so frivolous that does not merit a place in this
 rhapsody. According to our common rule of civility, it would be a notable
 affront to an equal, and much more to a superior, to fail being at home
 when he has given you notice he will come to visit you. Nay, Queen
 Margaret of Navarre further adds, that it would be a rudeness in a
 gentleman to go out, as we so often do, to meet any that is coming to see
 him, let him be of what high condition soever; and that it is more
 respectful and more civil to stay at home to receive him, if only upon the
 account of missing him by the way, and that it is enough to receive him at
 the door, and to wait upon him. For my part, who as much as I can
 endeavour to reduce the ceremonies of my house, I very often forget both
 the one and the other of these vain offices. If, peradventure, some one
 may take offence at this, I can't help it; it is much better to offend him
 once than myself every day, for it would be a perpetual slavery. To what
 end do we avoid the servile attendance of courts, if we bring the same
 trouble home to our own private houses? It is also a common rule in all
 assemblies, that those of less quality are to be first upon the place, by
 reason that it is more due to the better sort to make others wait and
 expect them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nevertheless, at the interview betwixt Pope Clement and King Francis at
 Marseilles,?[in 1533.]?the King, after he had taken order for
 the necessary preparations for his reception and entertainment, withdrew
 out of the town, and gave the Pope two or three days' respite for his
 entry, and to repose and refresh himself, before he came to him. And in
 like manner, at the assignation of the Pope and the Emperor,?[Charles
 V. in 1532.] at Bologna, the Emperor gave the Pope opportunity to come
 thither first, and came himself after; for which the reason given was
 this, that at all the interviews of such princes, the greater ought to be
 first at the appointed place, especially before the other in whose
 territories the interview is appointed to be, intimating thereby a kind of
 deference to the other, it appearing proper for the less to seek out and
 to apply themselves to the greater, and not the greater to them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not every country only, but every city and every society has its
 particular forms of civility. There was care enough to this taken in my
 education, and I have lived in good company enough to know the formalities
 of our own nation, and am able to give lessons in it. I love to follow
 them, but not to be so servilely tied to their observation that my whole
 life should be enslaved to ceremonies, of which there are some so
 troublesome that, provided a man omits them out of discretion, and not for
 want of breeding, it will be every whit as handsome. I have seen some
 people rude, by being overcivil and troublesome in their courtesy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still, these excesses excepted, the knowledge of courtesy and good manners
 is a very necessary study. It is, like grace and beauty, that which begets
 liking and an inclination to love one another at the first sight, and in
 the very beginning of acquaintance; and, consequently, that which first
 opens the door and intromits us to instruct ourselves by the example of
 others, and to give examples ourselves, if we have any worth taking notice
 of and communicating.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIV??THAT MEN ARE JUSTLY PUNISHED FOR BEING OBSTINATE
 IN THE DEFENCE OF A FORT THAT IS NOT IN REASON TO BE DEFENDED
 </h2>
 <p>
 Valour has its bounds as well as other virtues, which, once transgressed,
 the next step is into the territories of vice; so that by having too large
 a proportion of this heroic virtue, unless a man be very perfect in its
 limits, which upon the confines are very hard to discern, he may very
 easily unawares run into temerity, obstinacy, and folly. From this
 consideration it is that we have derived the custom, in times of war, to
 punish, even with death, those who are obstinate to defend a place that by
 the rules of war is not tenable; otherwise men would be so confident upon
 the hope of impunity, that not a henroost but would resist and seek to
 stop an army.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Constable Monsieur de Montmorenci, having at the siege of Pavia been
 ordered to pass the Ticino, and to take up his quarters in the Faubourg
 St. Antonio, being hindered by a tower at the end of the bridge, which was
 so obstinate as to endure a battery, hanged every man he found within it
 for their labour. And again, accompanying the Dauphin in his expedition
 beyond the Alps, and taking the Castle of Villano by assault, and all
 within it being put to the sword by the fury of the soldiers, the governor
 and his ensign only excepted, he caused them both to be trussed up for the
 same reason; as also did the Captain Martin du Bellay, then governor of
 Turin, with the governor of San Buono, in the same country, all his people
 having been cut to pieces at the taking of the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But forasmuch as the strength or weakness of a fortress is always measured
 by the estimate and counterpoise of the forces that attack it ?for a
 man might reasonably enough despise two culverins, that would be a madman
 to abide a battery of thirty pieces of cannon?where also the
 greatness of the prince who is master of the field, his reputation, and
 the respect that is due unto him, are also put into the balance, there is
 danger that the balance be pressed too much in that direction. And it may
 happen that a man is possessed with so great an opinion of himself and his
 power, that thinking it unreasonable any place should dare to shut its
 gates against him, he puts all to the sword where he meets with any
 opposition, whilst his fortune continues; as is plain in the fierce and
 arrogant forms of summoning towns and denouncing war, savouring so much of
 barbarian pride and insolence, in use amongst the Oriental princes, and
 which their successors to this day do yet retain and practise. And in that
 part of the world where the Portuguese subdued the Indians, they found
 some states where it was a universal and inviolable law amongst them that
 every enemy overcome by the king in person, or by his lieutenant, was out
 of composition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So above all both of ransom and mercy a man should take heed, if he can,
 of falling into the hands of a judge who is an enemy and victorious.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XV??OF THE PUNISHMENT OF COWARDICE
 </h2>
 <p>
 I once heard of a prince, and a great captain, having a narration given
 him as he sat at table of the proceeding against Monsieur de Vervins, who
 was sentenced to death for having surrendered Boulogne to the English,
 ?[To Henry VIII. in 1544]?openly maintaining that a soldier
 could not justly be put to death for want of courage. And, in truth, 'tis
 reason that a man should make a great difference betwixt faults that
 merely proceed from infirmity, and those that are visibly the effects of
 treachery and malice: for, in the last, we act against the rules of reason
 that nature has imprinted in us; whereas, in the former, it seems as if we
 might produce the same nature, who left us in such a state of imperfection
 and weakness of courage, for our justification. Insomuch that many have
 thought we are not fairly questionable for anything but what we commit
 against our conscience; and it is partly upon this rule that those ground
 their opinion who disapprove of capital or sanguinary punishments
 inflicted upon heretics and misbelievers; and theirs also who advocate or
 a judge is not accountable for having from mere ignorance failed in his
 administration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But as to cowardice, it is certain that the most usual way of chastising
 it is by ignominy and and it is supposed that this practice brought into
 use by the legislator Charondas; and that, before his time, the laws of
 Greece punished those with death who fled from a battle; whereas he
 ordained only that they be for three days exposed in the public dressed in
 woman's attire, hoping yet for some service from them, having awakened
 their courage by this open shame:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Suffundere malis homims sanguinem, quam effundere."

 ["Rather bring the blood into a man's cheek than let it out of his
 body." Tertullian in his Apologetics.]
</pre>
 <p>
 It appears also that the Roman laws did anciently punish those with death
 who had run away; for Ammianus Marcellinus says that the Emperor Julian
 commanded ten of his soldiers, who had turned their backs in an encounter
 against the Parthians, to be first degraded, and afterward put to death,
 according, says he, to the ancient laws,?[Ammianus Marcellinus,
 xxiv. 4; xxv. i.]?and yet elsewhere for the like offence he only
 condemned others to remain amongst the prisoners under the baggage ensign.
 The severe punishment the people of Rome inflicted upon those who fled
 from the battle of Cannae, and those who ran away with Aeneius Fulvius at
 his defeat, did not extend to death. And yet, methinks, 'tis to be feared,
 lest disgrace should make such delinquents desperate, and not only faint
 friends, but enemies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of late memory,?[In 1523]?the Seigneur de Frauget, lieutenant
 to the Mareschal de Chatillon's company, having by the Mareschal de
 Chabannes been put in government of Fuentarabia in the place of Monsieur
 de Lude, and having surrendered it to the Spaniard, he was for that
 condemned to be degraded from all nobility, and both himself and his
 posterity declared ignoble, taxable, and for ever incapable of bearing
 arms, which severe sentence was afterwards accordingly executed at Lyons.?[In
 1536] ?And, since that, all the gentlemen who were in Guise when the
 Count of Nassau entered into it, underwent the same punishment, as several
 others have done since for the like offence. Notwithstanding, in case of
 such a manifest ignorance or cowardice as exceeds all ordinary example,
 'tis but reason to take it for a sufficient proof of treachery and malice,
 and for such to be punished.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVI??A PROCEEDING OF SOME AMBASSADORS
 </h2>
 <p>
 I observe in my travels this custom, ever to learn something from the
 information of those with whom I confer (which is the best school of all
 others), and to put my company upon those subjects they are the best able
 to speak of:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Basti al nocchiero ragionar de' venti,
 Al bifolco dei tori; et le sue piaghe
 Conti'l guerrier; conti'l pastor gli armenti."

 ["Let the sailor content himself with talking of the winds; the
 cowherd of his oxen; the soldier of his wounds; the shepherd of his
 flocks."?An Italian translation of Propertius, ii. i, 43]
</pre>
 <p>
 For it often falls out that, on the contrary, every one will rather choose
 to be prating of another man's province than his own, thinking it so much
 new reputation acquired; witness the jeer Archidamus put upon Pertander,
 "that he had quitted the glory of being an excellent physician to gain the
 repute of a very bad poet.?[Plutarch, Apoth. of the Lacedaemonians,
 'in voce' Archidamus.]?And do but observe how large and ample Caesar
 is to make us understand his inventions of building bridges and contriving
 engines of war,?[De Bello Gall., iv. 17.]?and how succinct and
 reserved in comparison, where he speaks of the offices of his profession,
 his own valour, and military conduct. His exploits sufficiently prove him
 a great captain, and that he knew well enough; but he would be thought an
 excellent engineer to boot; a quality something different, and not
 necessary to be expected in him. The elder Dionysius was a very great
 captain, as it befitted his fortune he should be; but he took very great
 pains to get a particular reputation by poetry, and yet he was never cut
 out for a poet. A man of the legal profession being not long since brought
 to see a study furnished with all sorts of books, both of his own and all
 other faculties, took no occasion at all to entertain himself with any of
 them, but fell very rudely and magisterially to descant upon a barricade
 placed on the winding stair before the study door, a thing that a hundred
 captains and common soldiers see every day without taking any notice or
 offence.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Optat ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus."

 ["The lazy ox desires a saddle and bridle; the horse wants to
 plough."?Hor., Ep., i. 14,43.]
</pre>
 <p>
 By this course a man shall never improve himself, nor arrive at any
 perfection in anything. He must, therefore, make it his business always to
 put the architect, the painter, the statuary, every mechanic artisan, upon
 discourse of their own capacities.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, to this purpose, in reading histories, which is everybody's subject,
 I use to consider what kind of men are the authors: if they be persons
 that profess nothing but mere letters, I, in and from them, principally
 observe and learn style and language; if physicians, I the rather incline
 to credit what they report of the temperature of the air, of the health
 and complexions of princes, of wounds and diseases; if lawyers, we are
 from them to take notice of the controversies of rights and wrongs, the
 establishment of laws and civil government, and the like; if divines, the
 affairs of the Church, ecclesiastical censures, marriages, and
 dispensations; if courtiers, manners and ceremonies; if soldiers, the
 things that properly belong to their trade, and, principally, the accounts
 of the actions and enterprises wherein they were personally engaged; if
 ambassadors, we are to observe negotiations, intelligences, and practices,
 and the manner how they are to be carried on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And this is the reason why (which perhaps I should have lightly passed
 over in another) I dwelt upon and maturely considered one passage in the
 history written by Monsieur de Langey, a man of very great judgment in
 things of that nature: after having given a narrative of the fine oration
 Charles V. had made in the Consistory at Rome, and in the presence of the
 Bishop of Macon and Monsieur du Velly, our ambassadors there, wherein he
 had mixed several injurious expressions to the dishonour of our nation;
 and amongst the rest, "that if his captains and soldiers were not men of
 another kind of fidelity, resolution, and sufficiency in the knowledge of
 arms than those of the King, he would immediately go with a rope about his
 neck and sue to him for mercy" (and it should seem the Emperor had really
 this, or a very little better opinion of our military men, for he
 afterwards, twice or thrice in his life, said the very same thing); as
 also, that he challenged the King to fight him in his shirt with rapier
 and poignard in a boat. The said Sieur de Langey, pursuing his history,
 adds that the forenamed ambassadors, sending a despatch to the King of
 these things, concealed the greatest part, and particularly the last two
 passages. At which I could not but wonder that it should be in the power
 of an ambassador to dispense with anything which he ought to signify to
 his master, especially of so great importance as this, coming from the
 mouth of such a person, and spoken in so great an assembly; and I should
 rather conceive it had been the servant's duty faithfully to have
 represented to him the whole thing as it passed, to the end that the
 liberty of selecting, disposing, judging, and concluding might have
 remained in him: for either to conceal or to disguise the truth for fear
 he should take it otherwise than he ought to do, and lest it should prompt
 him to some extravagant resolution, and, in the meantime, to leave him
 ignorant of his affairs, should seem, methinks, rather to belong to him
 who is to give the law than to him who is only to receive it; to him who
 is in supreme command, and not to him who ought to look upon himself as
 inferior, not only in authority, but also in prudence and good counsel. I,
 for my part, would not be so served in my little concerns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We so willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever, and
 are so ready to usurp upon dominion, every one does so naturally aspire to
 liberty and power, that no utility whatever derived from the wit or valour
 of those he employs ought to be so dear to a superior as a downright and
 sincere obedience. To obey more upon the account of understanding than of
 subjection, is to corrupt the office of command ?[Taken from Aulus
 Gellius, i. 13.]?; insomuch that P. Crassus, the same whom the
 Romans reputed five times happy, at the time when he was consul in Asia,
 having sent to a Greek engineer to cause the greater of two masts of ships
 that he had taken notice of at Athens to be brought to him, to be employed
 about some engine of battery he had a design to make; the other, presuming
 upon his own science and sufficiency in those affairs, thought fit to do
 otherwise than directed, and to bring the less, which, according to the
 rules of art, was really more proper for the use to which it was designed;
 but Crassus, though he gave ear to his reasons with great patience, would
 not, however, take them, how sound or convincing soever, for current pay,
 but caused him to be well whipped for his pains, valuing the interest of
 discipline much more than that of the work in hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Notwithstanding, we may on the other side consider that so precise and
 implicit an obedience as this is only due to positive and limited
 commands. The employment of ambassadors is never so confined, many things
 in their management of affairs being wholly referred to the absolute
 sovereignty of their own conduct; they do not simply execute, but also, to
 their own discretion and wisdom, form and model their master's pleasure. I
 have, in my time, known men of command checked for having rather obeyed
 the express words of the king's letters, than the necessity of the affairs
 they had in hand. Men of understanding do yet, to this day, condemn the
 custom of the kings of Persia to give their lieutenants and agents so
 little rein, that, upon the least arising difficulties, they must fain
 have recourse to their further commands; this delay, in so vast an extent
 of dominion, having often very much prejudiced their affairs; and Crassus,
 writing to a man whose profession it was best to understand those things,
 and pre-acquainting him to what use this mast was designed, did he not
 seem to consult his advice, and in a manner invite him to interpose his
 better judgment?

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVII??OF FEAR
 </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Obstupui, steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit."

 ["I was amazed, my hair stood on end, and my voice stuck in my
 throat." Virgil, AEneid, ii. 774.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I am not so good a naturalist (as they call it) as to discern by what
 secret springs fear has its motion in us; but, be this as it may, 'tis a
 strange passion, and such a one that the physicians say there is no other
 whatever that sooner dethrones our judgment from its proper seat; which is
 so true, that I myself have seen very many become frantic through fear;
 and, even in those of the best settled temper it is most certain that it
 begets a terrible astonishment and confusion during the fit. I omit the
 vulgar sort, to whom it one while represents their great-grandsires risen
 out of their graves in their shrouds, another while werewolves,
 nightmares, and chimaeras; but even amongst soldiers, a sort of men over
 whom, of all others, it ought to have the least power, how often has it
 converted flocks of sheep into armed squadrons, reeds and bullrushes into
 pikes and lances, friends into enemies, and the French white cross into
 the red cross of Spain! When Monsieur de Bourbon took Rome,?[In 1527]?an
 ensign who was upon guard at Borgo San Pietro was seized with such a
 fright upon the first alarm, that he threw himself out at a breach with
 his colours upon his shoulder, and ran directly upon the enemy, thinking
 he had retreated toward the inward defences of the city, and with much
 ado, seeing Monsieur de Bourbon's people, who thought it had been a sally
 upon them, draw up to receive him, at last came to himself, and saw his
 error; and then facing about, he retreated full speed through the same
 breach by which he had gone out, but not till he had first blindly
 advanced above three hundred paces into the open field. It did not,
 however, fall out so well with Captain Giulio's ensign, at the time when
 St. Paul was taken from us by the Comte de Bures and Monsieur de Reu, for
 he, being so astonished with fear as to throw himself, colours and all,
 out of a porthole, was immediately, cut to pieces by the enemy; and in the
 same siege, it was a very memorable fear that so seized, contracted, and
 froze up the heart of a gentleman, that he sank down, stone-dead, in the
 breach, without any manner of wound or hurt at all. The like madness does
 sometimes push on a whole multitude; for in one of the encounters that
 Germanicus had with the Germans, two great parties were so amazed with
 fear that they ran two opposite ways, the one to the same place from which
 the other had fled.?[Tacit, Annal., i. 63.]?Sometimes it adds
 wings to the heels, as in the two first: sometimes it nails them to the
 ground, and fetters them from moving; as we read of the Emperor
 Theophilus, who, in a battle he lost against the Agarenes, was so
 astonished and stupefied that he had no power to fly?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Adeo pavor etiam auxilia formidat"

 ["So much does fear dread even the means of safety."?Quint.
 Curt., ii. II.]
</pre>
 <p>
 ?till such time as Manuel, one of the principal commanders of his
 army, having jogged and shaked him so as to rouse him out of his trance,
 said to him, "Sir, if you will not follow me, I will kill you; for it is
 better you should lose your life than, by being taken, lose your empire."
 ?[Zonaras, lib. iii.]?But fear does then manifest its utmost
 power when it throws us upon a valiant despair, having before deprived us
 of all sense both of duty and honour. In the first pitched battle the
 Romans lost against Hannibal, under the Consul Sempronius, a body of ten
 thousand foot, that had taken fright, seeing no other escape for their
 cowardice, went and threw themselves headlong upon the great battalion of
 the enemies, which with marvellous force and fury they charged through and
 through, and routed with a very great slaughter of the Carthaginians, thus
 purchasing an ignominious flight at the same price they might have gained
 a glorious victory.?[Livy, xxi. 56.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear, that passion alone, in
 the trouble of it, exceeding all other accidents. What affliction could be
 greater or more just than that of Pompey's friends, who, in his ship, were
 spectators of that horrible murder? Yet so it was, that the fear of the
 Egyptian vessels they saw coming to board them, possessed them with so
 great alarm that it is observed they thought of nothing but calling upon
 the mariners to make haste, and by force of oars to escape away, till
 being arrived at Tyre, and delivered from fear, they had leisure to turn
 their thoughts to the loss of their captain, and to give vent to those
 tears and lamentations that the other more potent passion had till then
 suspended.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tum pavor sapientiam omnem mihiex animo expectorat."

 ["Then fear drove out all intelligence from my mind."?Ennius, ap.
 Cicero, Tusc., iv. 8.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Such as have been well rubbed in some skirmish, may yet, all wounded and
 bloody as they are, be brought on again the next day to charge; but such
 as have once conceived a good sound fear of the enemy, will never be made
 so much as to look him in the face. Such as are in immediate fear of a
 losing their estates, of banishment, or of slavery, live in perpetual
 anguish, and lose all appetite and repose; whereas such as are actually
 poor, slaves, or exiles, ofttimes live as merrily as other folk. And the
 many people who, impatient of the perpetual alarms of fear, have hanged or
 drowned themselves, or dashed themselves to pieces, give us sufficiently
 to understand that fear is more importunate and insupportable than death
 itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Greeks acknowledged another kind of fear, differing from any we have
 spoken of yet, that surprises us without any visible cause, by an impulse
 from heaven, so that whole nations and whole armies have been struck with
 it. Such a one was that which brought so wonderful a desolation upon
 Carthage, where nothing was to be heard but affrighted voices and
 outcries; where the inhabitants were seen to sally out of their houses as
 to an alarm, and there to charge, wound, and kill one another, as if they
 had been enemies come to surprise their city. All things were in disorder
 and fury till, with prayers and sacrifices, they had appeased their gods?[Diod.
 Sic., xv. 7]; and this is that they call panic terrors.?[Ibid. ;

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVIII??THAT MEN ARE NOT TO JUDGE OF OUR HAPPINESS TILL
 AFTER DEATH.
 </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [Charron has borrowed with unusual liberality from this and the
 succeeding chapter. See Nodier, Questions, p. 206.]

 "Scilicet ultima semper
 Exspectanda dies homini est; dicique beatus
 Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet."

 ["We should all look forward to our last day: no one can be called
 happy till he is dead and buried."?Ovid, Met, iii. 135]
</pre>
 <p>
 The very children know the story of King Croesus to this purpose, who
 being taken prisoner by Cyrus, and by him condemned to die, as he was
 going to execution cried out, "O Solon, Solon!" which being presently
 reported to Cyrus, and he sending to inquire of him what it meant, Croesus
 gave him to understand that he now found the teaching Solon had formerly
 given him true to his cost; which was, "That men, however fortune may
 smile upon them, could never be said to be happy till they had been seen
 to pass over the last day of their lives," by reason of the uncertainty
 and mutability of human things, which, upon very light and trivial
 occasions, are subject to be totally changed into a quite contrary
 condition. And so it was that Agesilaus made answer to one who was saying
 what a happy young man the King of Persia was, to come so young to so
 mighty a kingdom: "'Tis true," said he, "but neither was Priam unhappy at
 his years."?[Plutarch, Apothegms of the Lacedaemonians.]?In a
 short time, kings of Macedon, successors to that mighty Alexander, became
 joiners and scriveners at Rome; a tyrant of Sicily, a pedant at Corinth; a
 conqueror of one-half of the world and general of so many armies, a
 miserable suppliant to the rascally officers of a king of Egypt: so much
 did the prolongation of five or six months of life cost the great Pompey;
 and, in our fathers' days, Ludovico Sforza, the tenth Duke of Milan, whom
 all Italy had so long truckled under, was seen to die a wretched prisoner
 at Loches, but not till he had lived ten years in captivity,?[He was
 imprisoned by Louis XI. in an iron cage]? which was the worst part
 of his fortune. The fairest of all queens, ?[Mary, Queen of Scots.]?widow
 to the greatest king in Europe, did she not come to die by the hand of an
 executioner? Unworthy and barbarous cruelty! And a thousand more examples
 there are of the same kind; for it seems that as storms and tempests have
 a malice against the proud and overtowering heights of our lofty
 buildings, there are also spirits above that are envious of the
 greatnesses here below:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Usque adeo res humanas vis abdita quaedam
 Obterit, et pulchros fasces, saevasque secures
 Proculcare, ac ludibrio sibi habere videtur."

 ["So true it is that some occult power upsets human affairs, the
 glittering fasces and the cruel axes spurns under foot, and seems to
 make sport of them."?Lucretius, v. 1231.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And it should seem, also, that Fortune sometimes lies in wait to surprise
 the last hour of our lives, to show the power she has, in a moment, to
 overthrow what she was so many years in building, making us cry out with
 Laberius:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nimirum hac die
 Una plus vixi mihi, quam vivendum fuit."

 ["I have lived longer by this one day than I should have
 done."?Macrobius, ii. 7.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And, in this sense, this good advice of Solon may reasonably be taken; but
 he, being a philosopher (with which sort of men the favours and disgraces
 of Fortune stand for nothing, either to the making a man happy or unhappy,
 and with whom grandeurs and powers are accidents of a quality almost
 indifferent) I am apt to think that he had some further aim, and that his
 meaning was, that the very felicity of life itself, which depends upon the
 tranquillity and contentment of a well-descended spirit, and the
 resolution and assurance of a well-ordered soul, ought never to be
 attributed to any man till he has first been seen to play the last, and,
 doubtless, the hardest act of his part. There may be disguise and
 dissimulation in all the rest: where these fine philosophical discourses
 are only put on, and where accident, not touching us to the quick, gives
 us leisure to maintain the same gravity of aspect; but, in this last scene
 of death, there is no more counterfeiting: we must speak out plain, and
 discover what there is of good and clean in the bottom of the pot,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nam vera; voces turn demum pectore ab imo
 Ejiciuntur; et eripitur persona, manet res."

 ["Then at last truth issues from the heart; the visor's gone,
 the man remains."?Lucretius, iii. 57.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Wherefore, at this last, all the other actions of our life ought to be
 tried and sifted: 'tis the master-day, 'tis the day that is judge of all
 the rest, "'tis the day," says one of the ancients,?[Seneca, Ep.,
 102]? "that must be judge of all my foregoing years." To death do I
 refer the assay of the fruit of all my studies: we shall then see whether
 my discourses came only from my mouth or from my heart. I have seen many
 by their death give a good or an ill repute to their whole life. Scipio,
 the father-in-law of Pompey, in dying, well removed the ill opinion that
 till then every one had conceived of him. Epaminondas being asked which of
 the three he had in greatest esteem, Chabrias, Iphicrates, or himself.
 "You must first see us die," said he, "before that question can be
 resolved."?[Plutarch, Apoth.]?And, in truth, he would
 infinitely wrong that man who would weigh him without the honour and
 grandeur of his end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 God has ordered all things as it has best pleased Him; but I have, in my
 time, seen three of the most execrable persons that ever I knew in all
 manner of abominable living, and the most infamous to boot, who all died a
 very regular death, and in all circumstances composed, even to perfection.
 There are brave and fortunate deaths: I have seen death cut the thread of
 the progress of a prodigious advancement, and in the height and flower of
 its increase, of a certain person,?[Montaigne doubtless refers to
 his friend Etienne de la Boetie, at whose death in 1563 he was present.]?with
 so glorious an end that, in my opinion, his ambitious and generous designs
 had nothing in them so high and great as their interruption. He arrived,
 without completing his course, at the place to which his ambition aimed,
 with greater glory than he could either have hoped or desired,
 anticipating by his fall the name and power to which he aspired in
 perfecting his career. In the judgment I make of another man's life, I
 always observe how he carried himself at his death; and the principal
 concern I have for my own is that I may die well?that is, patiently
 and tranquilly.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIX??THAT TO STUDY PHILOSOPY IS TO LEARN TO DIE
 </h2>
 <p>
 Cicero says?[Tusc., i. 31.]?"that to study philosophy is
 nothing but to prepare one's self to die." The reason of which is, because
 study and contemplation do in some sort withdraw from us our soul, and
 employ it separately from the body, which is a kind of apprenticeship and
 a resemblance of death; or, else, because all the wisdom and reasoning in
 the world do in the end conclude in this point, to teach us not to fear to
 die. And to say the truth, either our reason mocks us, or it ought to have
 no other aim but our contentment only, nor to endeavour anything but, in
 sum, to make us live well, and, as the Holy Scripture says, at our ease.
 All the opinions of the world agree in this, that pleasure is our end,
 though we make use of divers means to attain it: they would, otherwise, be
 rejected at the first motion; for who would give ear to him that should
 propose affliction and misery for his end? The controversies and disputes
 of the philosophical sects upon this point are merely verbal:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Transcurramus solertissimas nugas"

 ["Let us skip over those subtle trifles."?Seneca, Ep., 117.]
</pre>
 <p>
 ?there is more in them of opposition and obstinacy than is
 consistent with so sacred a profession; but whatsoever personage a man
 takes upon himself to perform, he ever mixes his own part with it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let the philosophers say what they will, the thing at which we all aim,
 even in virtue is pleasure. It amuses me to rattle in ears this word,
 which they so nauseate to and if it signify some supreme pleasure and
 contentment, it is more due to the assistance of virtue than to any other
 assistance whatever. This pleasure, for being more gay, more sinewy, more
 robust and more manly, is only the more seriously voluptuous, and we ought
 give it the name of pleasure, as that which is more favourable, gentle,
 and natural, and not that from which we have denominated it. The other and
 meaner pleasure, if it could deserve this fair name, it ought to be by way
 of competition, and not of privilege. I find it less exempt from traverses
 and inconveniences than virtue itself; and, besides that the enjoyment is
 more momentary, fluid, and frail, it has its watchings, fasts, and
 labours, its sweat and its blood; and, moreover, has particular to itself
 so many several sorts of sharp and wounding passions, and so dull a
 satiety attending it, as equal it to the severest penance. And we mistake
 if we think that these incommodities serve it for a spur and a seasoning
 to its sweetness (as in nature one contrary is quickened by another), or
 say, when we come to virtue, that like consequences and difficulties
 overwhelm and render it austere and inaccessible; whereas, much more aptly
 than in voluptuousness, they ennoble, sharpen, and heighten the perfect
 and divine pleasure they procure us. He renders himself unworthy of it who
 will counterpoise its cost with its fruit, and neither understands the
 blessing nor how to use it. Those who preach to us that the quest of it is
 craggy, difficult, and painful, but its fruition pleasant, what do they
 mean by that but to tell us that it is always unpleasing? For what human
 means will ever attain its enjoyment? The most perfect have been fain to
 content themselves to aspire unto it, and to approach it only, without
 ever possessing it. But they are deceived, seeing that of all the
 pleasures we know, the very pursuit is pleasant. The attempt ever relishes
 of the quality of the thing to which it is directed, for it is a good part
 of, and consubstantial with, the effect. The felicity and beatitude that
 glitters in Virtue, shines throughout all her appurtenances and avenues,
 even to the first entry and utmost limits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, of all the benefits that virtue confers upon us, the contempt of
 death is one of the greatest, as the means that accommodates human life
 with a soft and easy tranquillity, and gives us a pure and pleasant taste
 of living, without which all other pleasure would be extinct. Which is the
 reason why all the rules centre and concur in this one article. And
 although they all in like manner, with common accord, teach us also to
 despise pain, poverty, and the other accidents to which human life is
 subject, it is not, nevertheless, with the same solicitude, as well by
 reason these accidents are not of so great necessity, the greater part of
 mankind passing over their whole lives without ever knowing what poverty
 is, and some without sorrow or sickness, as Xenophilus the musician, who
 lived a hundred and six years in a perfect and continual health; as also
 because, at the worst, death can, whenever we please, cut short and put an
 end to all other inconveniences. But as to death, it is inevitable:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Omnes eodem cogimur; omnium
 Versatur urna serius ocius
 Sors exitura, et nos in aeternum
 Exilium impositura cymbae."

 ["We are all bound one voyage; the lot of all, sooner or later, is
 to come out of the urn. All must to eternal exile sail away."
 ?Hor., Od., ii. 3, 25.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and, consequently, if it frights us, 'tis a perpetual torment, for which
 there is no sort of consolation. There is no way by which it may not reach
 us. We may continually turn our heads this way and that, as in a suspected
 country:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quae, quasi saxum Tantalo, semper impendet."

 ["Ever, like Tantalus stone, hangs over us."
 ?Cicero, De Finib., i. 18.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Our courts of justice often send back condemned criminals to be executed

 The end of our race is death; 'tis the necessary object of our aim, which,
 if it fright us, how is it possible to advance a step without a fit of
 ague? The remedy the vulgar use is not to think on't; but from what
 brutish stupidity can they derive so gross a blindness? They must bridle
 the ass by the tail:

 <p>
 'tis no wonder if he be often trapped in the pitfall. They affright people
 with the very mention of death, and many cross themselves, as it were the
 name of the devil. And because the making a man's will is in reference to
 dying, not a man will be persuaded to take a pen in hand to that purpose,
 till the physician has passed sentence upon and totally given him over,
 and then betwixt and terror, God knows in how fit a condition of
 understanding he is to do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Romans, by reason that this poor syllable death sounded so harshly to
 their ears and seemed so ominous, found out a way to soften and spin it
 out by a periphrasis, and instead of pronouncing such a one is dead, said,
 "Such a one has lived," or "Such a one has ceased to live" ?[Plutarch,
 Life of Cicero, c. 22:]?for, provided there was any mention of life
 in the case, though past, it carried yet some sound of consolation. And
 from them it is that we have borrowed our expression, "The late Monsieur
 such and such a one."?["feu Monsieur un tel."] Peradventure, as the
 saying is, the term we have lived is worth our money. I was born betwixt
 eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon the last day of February 1533,
 according to our computation, beginning the year the 1st of January,?[This
 was in virtue of an ordinance of Charles IX. in 1563. Previously the year
 commenced at Easter, so that the 1st January 1563 became the first day of
 the year 1563.]?and it is now but just fifteen days since I was
 complete nine-and-thirty years old; I make account to live, at least, as
 many more. In the meantime, to trouble a man's self with the thought of a
 thing so far off were folly. But what? Young and old die upon the same
 terms; no one departs out of life otherwise than if he had but just before
 entered into it; neither is any man so old and decrepit, who, having heard
 of Methuselah, does not think he has yet twenty good years to come. Fool
 that thou art! who has assured unto thee the term of life? Thou dependest
 upon physicians' tales: rather consult effects and experience. According
 to the common course of things, 'tis long since that thou hast lived by
 extraordinary favour; thou hast already outlived the ordinary term of
 life. And that it is so, reckon up thy acquaintance, how many more have
 died before they arrived at thy age than have attained unto it; and of
 those who have ennobled their lives by their renown, take but an account,
 and I dare lay a wager thou wilt find more who have died before than after
 five-and-thirty years of age. It is full both of reason and piety, too, to
 take example by the humanity of Jesus Christ Himself; now, He ended His
 life at three-and-thirty years. The greatest man, that was no more than a
 man, Alexander, died also at the same age. How many several ways has death
 to surprise us?

 To omit fevers and pleurisies, who would ever have imagined that a duke of
 Brittany,?[Jean II. died 1305.]?should be pressed to death in
 a crowd as that duke was at the entry of Pope Clement, my neighbour, into
 Lyons??[Montaigne speaks of him as if he had been a contemporary
 neighbour, perhaps because he was the Archbishop of Bordeaux. Bertrand le
 Got was Pope under the title of Clement V., 1305-14.]?Hast thou not
 seen one of our kings?[Henry II., killed in a tournament, July 10,
 1559]?killed at a tilting, and did not one of his ancestors die by
 jostle of a hog??[Philip, eldest son of Louis le Gros.]?AEschylus,
 threatened with the fall of a house, was to much purpose circumspect to
 avoid that danger, seeing that he was knocked on the head by a tortoise
 falling out of an eagle's talons in the air. Another was choked with a
 grape-stone;?[Val. Max., ix. 12, ext. 2.]?an emperor killed
 with the scratch of a comb in combing his head. AEmilius Lepidus with a
 stumble at his own threshold,?[Pliny, Nat. Hist., vii. 33.]?
 and Aufidius with a jostle against the door as he entered the
 council-chamber. And betwixt the very thighs of women, Cornelius Gallus
 the proctor; Tigillinus, captain of the watch at Rome; Ludovico, son of
 Guido di Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua; and (of worse example) Speusippus, a
 Platonic philosopher, and one of our Popes. The poor judge Bebius gave
 adjournment in a case for eight days; but he himself, meanwhile, was
 condemned by death, and his own stay of life expired. Whilst Caius Julius,
 the physician, was anointing the eyes of a patient, death closed his own;
 and, if I may bring in an example of my own blood, a brother of mine,
 Captain St. Martin, a young man, three-and-twenty years old, who had
 already given sufficient testimony of his valour, playing a match at
 tennis, received a blow of a ball a little above his right ear, which, as
 it gave no manner of sign of wound or contusion, he took no notice of it,
 nor so much as sat down to repose himself, but, nevertheless, died within
 five or six hours after of an apoplexy occasioned by that blow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These so frequent and common examples passing every day before our eyes,
 how is it possible a man should disengage himself from the thought of
 death, or avoid fancying that it has us every moment by the throat? What
 matter is it, you will say, which way it comes to pass, provided a man
 does not terrify himself with the expectation? For my part, I am of this
 mind, and if a man could by any means avoid it, though by creeping under a
 calf's skin, I am one that should not be ashamed of the shift; all I aim
 at is, to pass my time at my ease, and the recreations that will most
 contribute to it, I take hold of, as little glorious and exemplary as you
 will:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Praetulerim . . . delirus inersque videri,
 Dum mea delectent mala me, vel denique fallant,
 Quam sapere, et ringi."

 ["I had rather seem mad and a sluggard, so that my defects are
 agreeable to myself, or that I am not painfully conscious of them,
 than be wise, and chaptious."?Hor., Ep., ii. 2, 126.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But 'tis folly to think of doing anything that way. They go, they come,
 they gallop and dance, and not a word of death. All this is very fine; but
 withal, when it comes either to themselves, their wives, their children,
 or friends, surprising them at unawares and unprepared, then, what
 torment, what outcries, what madness and despair! Did you ever see
 anything so subdued, so changed, and so confounded? A man must, therefore,
 make more early provision for it; and this brutish negligence, could it
 possibly lodge in the brain of any man of sense (which I think utterly
 impossible), sells us its merchandise too dear. Were it an enemy that
 could be avoided, I would then advise to borrow arms even of cowardice
 itself; but seeing it is not, and that it will catch you as well flying
 and playing the poltroon, as standing to't like an honest man:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nempe et fugacem persequitur virum,
 Nec parcit imbellis juventae
 Poplitibus timidoque tergo."

 ["He pursues the flying poltroon, nor spares the hamstrings of the
 unwarlike youth who turns his back"?Hor., Ep., iii. 2, 14.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And seeing that no temper of arms is of proof to secure us:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ille licet ferro cautus, se condat et aere,
 Mors tamen inclusum protrahet inde caput"

 ["Let him hide beneath iron or brass in his fear, death will pull
 his head out of his armour."?Propertious iii. 18]
</pre>
 <p>
 ?let us learn bravely to stand our ground, and fight him. And to
 begin to deprive him of the greatest advantage he has over us, let us take
 a way quite contrary to the common course. Let us disarm him of his
 novelty and strangeness, let us converse and be familiar with him, and
 have nothing so frequent in our thoughts as death. Upon all occasions
 represent him to our imagination in his every shape; at the stumbling of a
 horse, at the falling of a tile, at the least prick with a pin, let us
 presently consider, and say to ourselves, "Well, and what if it had been
 death itself?" and, thereupon, let us encourage and fortify ourselves. Let
 us evermore, amidst our jollity and feasting, set the remembrance of our
 frail condition before our eyes, never suffering ourselves to be so far
 transported with our delights, but that we have some intervals of
 reflecting upon, and considering how many several ways this jollity of
 ours tends to death, and with how many dangers it threatens it. The
 Egyptians were wont to do after this manner, who in the height of their
 feasting and mirth, caused a dried skeleton of a man to be brought into
 the room to serve for a memento to their guests:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum
 Grata superveniet, quae non sperabitur, hora."

 ["Think each day when past is thy last; the next day, as unexpected,
 will be the more welcome."?Hor., Ep., i. 4, 13.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Where death waits for us is uncertain; let us look for him everywhere. The
 premeditation of death is the premeditation of liberty; he who has learned
 to die has unlearned to serve. There is nothing evil in life for him who
 rightly comprehends that the privation of life is no evil: to know, how to
 die delivers us from all subjection and constraint. Paulus Emilius
 answered him whom the miserable King of Macedon, his prisoner, sent to
 entreat him that he would not lead him in his triumph, "Let him make that
 request to himself."?[ Plutarch, Life of Paulus Aemilius, c. 17;
 Cicero, Tusc., v. 40.]

 <p>
 In truth, in all things, if nature do not help a little, it is very hard
 for art and industry to perform anything to purpose. I am in my own nature
 not melancholic, but meditative; and there is nothing I have more
 continually entertained myself withal than imaginations of death, even in
 the most wanton time of my age:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Jucundum quum aetas florida ver ageret."

 ["When my florid age rejoiced in pleasant spring."
 ?Catullus, lxviii.]
</pre>
 <p>
 In the company of ladies, and at games, some have perhaps thought me
 possessed with some jealousy, or the uncertainty of some hope, whilst I
 was entertaining myself with the remembrance of some one, surprised, a few
 days before, with a burning fever of which he died, returning from an
 entertainment like this, with his head full of idle fancies of love and
 jollity, as mine was then, and that, for aught I knew, the same-destiny
 was attending me.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Jam fuerit, nec post unquam revocare licebit."

 ["Presently the present will have gone, never to be recalled."

</pre>
 <p>
 Yet did not this thought wrinkle my forehead any more than any other. It
 is impossible but we must feel a sting in such imaginations as these, at
 first; but with often turning and returning them in one's mind, they, at
 last, become so familiar as to be no trouble at all: otherwise, I, for my
 part, should be in a perpetual fright and frenzy; for never man was so
 distrustful of his life, never man so uncertain as to its duration.
 Neither health, which I have hitherto ever enjoyed very strong and
 vigorous, and very seldom interrupted, does prolong, nor sickness contract
 my hopes. Every minute, methinks, I am escaping, and it eternally runs in
 my mind, that what may be done to-morrow, may be done to-day. Hazards and
 dangers do, in truth, little or nothing hasten our end; and if we consider
 how many thousands more remain and hang over our heads, besides the
 accident that immediately threatens us, we shall find that the sound and
 the sick, those that are abroad at sea, and those that sit by the fire,
 those who are engaged in battle, and those who sit idle at home, are the
 one as near it as the other.

 For anything I have to do before I die, the longest leisure would appear
 too short, were it but an hour's business I had to do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A friend of mine the other day turning over my tablets, found therein a
 memorandum of something I would have done after my decease, whereupon I
 told him, as it was really true, that though I was no more than a league's
 distance only from my own house, and merry and well, yet when that thing
 came into my head, I made haste to write it down there, because I was not
 certain to live till I came home. As a man that am eternally brooding over
 my own thoughts, and confine them to my own particular concerns, I am at
 all hours as well prepared as I am ever like to be, and death, whenever he
 shall come, can bring nothing along with him I did not expect long before.
 We should always, as near as we can, be booted and spurred, and ready to
 go, and, above all things, take care, at that time, to have no business
 with any one but one's self:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quid brevi fortes jaculamur avo
 Multa?"

 ["Why for so short a life tease ourselves with so many projects?"
 ?Hor., Od., ii. 16, 17.]
</pre>
 <p>
 for we shall there find work enough to do, without any need of addition.
 One man complains, more than of death, that he is thereby prevented of a
 glorious victory; another, that he must die before he has married his
 daughter, or educated his children; a third seems only troubled that he
 must lose the society of his wife; a fourth, the conversation of his son,
 as the principal comfort and concern of his being. For my part, I am,
 thanks be to God, at this instant in such a condition, that I am ready to
 dislodge, whenever it shall please Him, without regret for anything
 whatsoever. I disengage myself throughout from all worldly relations; my
 leave is soon taken of all but myself. Never did any one prepare to bid
 adieu to the world more absolutely and unreservedly, and to shake hands
 with all manner of interest in it, than I expect to do. The deadest deaths
 are the best:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "'Miser, O miser,' aiunt, 'omnia ademit
 Una dies infesta mihi tot praemia vitae.'"

 ["'Wretch that I am,' they cry, 'one fatal day has deprived me of
 all joys of life.'"?Lucretius, iii. 911.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And the builder,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Manuet," says he, "opera interrupta, minaeque
 Murorum ingentes."

 ["The works remain incomplete, the tall pinnacles of the walls
 unmade."?AEneid, iv. 88.]
</pre>
 <p>
 A man must design nothing that will require so much time to the finishing,
 or, at least, with no such passionate desire to see it brought to
 perfection. We are born to action:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quum moriar, medium solvar et inter opus."

 ["When I shall die, let it be doing that I had designed."
 ?Ovid, Amor., ii. 10, 36.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I would always have a man to be doing, and, as much as in him lies, to
 extend and spin out the offices of life; and then let death take me
 planting my cabbages, indifferent to him, and still less of my gardens not
 being finished. I saw one die, who, at his last gasp, complained of
 nothing so much as that destiny was about to cut the thread of a chronicle
 he was then compiling, when he was gone no farther than the fifteenth or
 sixteenth of our kings:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Illud in his rebus non addunt: nec tibi earum
 jam desiderium rerum super insidet una."

 ["They do not add, that dying, we have no longer a desire to possess
 things."?Lucretius, iii. 913.]
</pre>
 <p>
 We are to discharge ourselves from these vulgar and hurtful humours. To
 this purpose it was that men first appointed the places of sepulture
 adjoining the churches, and in the most frequented places of the city, to
 accustom, says Lycurgus, the common people, women, and children, that they
 should not be startled at the sight of a corpse, and to the end, that the
 continual spectacle of bones, graves, and funeral obsequies should put us
 in mind of our frail condition:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quin etiam exhilarare viris convivia caede
 Mos olim, et miscere epulis spectacula dira
 Certantum ferro, saepe et super ipsa cadentum
 Pocula, respersis non parco sanguine mensis."

 ["It was formerly the custom to enliven banquets with slaughter, and
 to combine with the repast the dire spectacle of men contending with
 the sword, the dying in many cases falling upon the cups, and
 covering the tables with blood."?Silius Italicus, xi. 51.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And as the Egyptians after their feasts were wont to present the company
 with a great image of death, by one that cried out to them, "Drink and be
 merry, for such shalt thou be when thou art dead"; so it is my custom to
 have death not only in my imagination, but continually in my mouth.
 Neither is there anything of which I am so inquisitive, and delight to
 inform myself, as the manner of men's deaths, their words, looks, and
 bearing; nor any places in history I am so intent upon; and it is manifest
 enough, by my crowding in examples of this kind, that I have a particular
 fancy for that subject. If I were a writer of books, I would compile a
 register, with a comment, of the various deaths of men: he who should
 teach men to die would at the same time teach them to live. Dicarchus made
 one, to which he gave that title; but it was designed for another and less
 profitable end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Peradventure, some one may object, that the pain and terror of dying so
 infinitely exceed all manner of imagination, that the best fencer will be
 quite out of his play when it comes to the push. Let them say what they
 will: to premeditate is doubtless a very great advantage; and besides, is
 it nothing to go so far, at least, without disturbance or alteration?
 Moreover, Nature herself assists and encourages us: if the death be sudden
 and violent, we have not leisure to fear; if otherwise, I perceive that as
 I engage further in my disease, I naturally enter into a certain loathing
 and disdain of life. I find I have much more ado to digest this resolution
 of dying, when I am well in health, than when languishing of a fever; and
 by how much I have less to do with the commodities of life, by reason that
 I begin to lose the use and pleasure of them, by so much I look upon death
 with less terror. Which makes me hope, that the further I remove from the
 first, and the nearer I approach to the latter, I shall the more easily
 exchange the one for the other. And, as I have experienced in other
 occurrences, that, as Caesar says, things often appear greater to us at
 distance than near at hand, I have found, that being well, I have had
 maladies in much greater horror than when really afflicted with them. The
 vigour wherein I now am, the cheerfulness and delight wherein I now live,
 make the contrary estate appear in so great a disproportion to my present
 condition, that, by imagination, I magnify those inconveniences by
 one-half, and apprehend them to be much more troublesome, than I find them
 really to be, when they lie the most heavy upon me; I hope to find death
 the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let us but observe in the ordinary changes and declinations we daily
 suffer, how nature deprives us of the light and sense of our bodily decay.
 What remains to an old man of the vigour of his youth and better days?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Heu! senibus vitae portio quanta manet."

 ["Alas, to old men what portion of life remains!"?-Maximian, vel
 Pseudo-Gallus, i. 16.]

 <p>
 Caesar, to an old weather-beaten soldier of his guards, who came to ask
 him leave that he might kill himself, taking notice of his withered body
 and decrepit motion, pleasantly answered, "Thou fanciest, then, that thou
 art yet alive."?[Seneca, Ep., 77.]?Should a man fall into this
 condition on the sudden, I do not think humanity capable of enduring such
 a change: but nature, leading us by the hand, an easy and, as it were, an
 insensible pace, step by step conducts us to that miserable state, and by
 that means makes it familiar to us, so that we are insensible of the
 stroke when our youth dies in us, though it be really a harder death than
 the final dissolution of a languishing body, than the death of old age;
 forasmuch as the fall is not so great from an uneasy being to none at all,
 as it is from a sprightly and flourishing being to one that is troublesome
 and painful. The body, bent and bowed, has less force to support a burden;
 and it is the same with the soul, and therefore it is, that we are to
 raise her up firm and erect against the power of this adversary. For, as
 it is impossible she should ever be at rest, whilst she stands in fear of
 it; so, if she once can assure herself, she may boast (which is a thing as
 it were surpassing human condition) that it is impossible that disquiet,
 anxiety, or fear, or any other disturbance, should inhabit or have any
 place in her:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non vulnus instants Tyranni
 Mentha cadi solida, neque Auster
 Dux inquieti turbidus Adriae,
 Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus."

 ["Not the menacing look of a tyrant shakes her well-settled soul,
 nor turbulent Auster, the prince of the stormy Adriatic, nor yet the
 strong hand of thundering Jove, such a temper moves."
 ?Hor., Od., iii. 3, 3.]
</pre>
 <p>
 She is then become sovereign of all her lusts and passions, mistress of
 necessity, shame, poverty, and all the other injuries of fortune. Let us,
 therefore, as many of us as can, get this advantage; 'tis the true and
 sovereign liberty here on earth, that fortifies us wherewithal to defy
 violence and injustice, and to contemn prisons and chains:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "In manicis et
 Compedibus saevo te sub custode tenebo.
 Ipse Deus, simul atque volam, me solvet. Opinor,
 Hoc sentit; moriar; mors ultima linea rerum est."

 ["I will keep thee in fetters and chains, in custody of a
 savage keeper.?A god will when I ask Him, set me free.
 This god I think is death. Death is the term of all things."
 ?Hor., Ep., i. 16, 76.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Our very religion itself has no surer human foundation than the contempt
 of death. Not only the argument of reason invites us to it?for why
 should we fear to lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be lamented?
 ?but, also, seeing we are threatened by so many sorts of death, is
 it not infinitely worse eternally to fear them all, than once to undergo
 one of them? And what matters it, when it shall happen, since it is
 inevitable? To him that told Socrates, "The thirty tyrants have sentenced
 thee to death"; "And nature them," said he.?[Socrates was not
 condemned to death by the thirty tyrants, but by the Athenians.-Diogenes
 Laertius, ii.35.]? What a ridiculous thing it is to trouble
 ourselves about taking the only step that is to deliver us from all
 trouble! As our birth brought us the birth of all things, so in our death
 is the death of all things included. And therefore to lament that we shall
 not be alive a hundred years hence, is the same folly as to be sorry we
 were not alive a hundred years ago. Death is the beginning of another
 life. So did we weep, and so much it cost us to enter into this, and so
 did we put off our former veil in entering into it. Nothing can be a
 grievance that is but once. Is it reasonable so long to fear a thing that
 will so soon be despatched? Long life, and short, are by death made all
 one; for there is no long, nor short, to things that are no more.
 Aristotle tells us that there are certain little beasts upon the banks of
 the river Hypanis, that never live above a day: they which die at eight of
 the clock in the morning, die in their youth, and those that die at five
 in the evening, in their decrepitude: which of us would not laugh to see
 this moment of continuance put into the consideration of weal or woe? The
 most and the least, of ours, in comparison with eternity, or yet with the
 duration of mountains, rivers, stars, trees, and even of some animals, is
 no less ridiculous.?[ Seneca, Consol. ad Marciam, c. 20.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But nature compels us to it. "Go out of this world," says she, "as you
 entered into it; the same pass you made from death to life, without
 passion or fear, the same, after the same manner, repeat from life to
 death. Your death is a part of the order of the universe, 'tis a part of
 the life of the world.

 "All the whole time you live, you purloin from life and live at the

 foundation of death. You are in death, whilst you are in life, because you
 still are after death, when you are no more alive; or, if you had rather
 have it so, you are dead after life, but dying all the while you live; and
 death handles the dying much more rudely than the dead, and more sensibly

 Wherever your life ends, it is all there. The utility of living consists
 not in the length of days, but in the use of time; a man may have lived
 long, and yet lived but a little. Make use of time while it is present
 with you. It depends upon your will, and not upon the number of days, to
 have a sufficient length of life. Is it possible you can imagine never to
 arrive at the place towards which you are continually going? and yet there
 is no journey but hath its end. And, if company will make it more pleasant
 or more easy to you, does not all the world go the self-same way?

<pre xml:space="preserve"> "'Nam nox nulla diem, neque noctem aurora sequuta est,
 Quae non audierit mistos vagitibus aegris
 Ploratus, mortis comites et funeris atri.'

 ["No night has followed day, no day has followed night, in which
 there has not been heard sobs and sorrowing cries, the companions of
 death and funerals."?Lucretius, v. 579.]
</pre>
 <p>
 "To what end should you endeavour to draw back, if there be no possibility
 to evade it? you have seen examples enough of those who have been well
 pleased to die, as thereby delivered from heavy miseries; but have you
 ever found any who have been dissatisfied with dying? It must, therefore,
 needs be very foolish to condemn a thing you have neither experimented in
 your own person, nor by that of any other. Why dost thou complain of me
 and of destiny? Do we do thee any wrong? Is it for thee to govern us, or
 for us to govern thee? Though, peradventure, thy age may not be
 accomplished, yet thy life is: a man of low stature is as much a man as a
 giant; neither men nor their lives are measured by the ell. Chiron refused
 to be immortal, when he was acquainted with the conditions under which he
 was to enjoy it, by the god of time itself and its duration, his father
 Saturn. Do but seriously consider how much more insupportable and painful
 an immortal life would be to man than what I have already given him. If
 you had not death, you would eternally curse me for having deprived you of
 it; I have mixed a little bitterness with it, to the end, that seeing of
 what convenience it is, you might not too greedily and indiscreetly seek
 and embrace it: and that you might be so established in this moderation,
 as neither to nauseate life, nor have any antipathy for dying, which I
 have decreed you shall once do, I have tempered the one and the other
 betwixt pleasure and pain. It was I that taught Thales, the most eminent
 of your sages, that to live and to die were indifferent; which made him,
 very wisely, answer him, 'Why then he did not die?' 'Because,' said he,
 'it is indifferent.'?[Diogenes Laertius, i. 35.]?Water, earth,
 air, and fire, and the other parts of this creation of mine, are no more
 instruments of thy life than they are of thy death. Why dost thou fear thy
 last day? it contributes no more to thy dissolution, than every one of the
 rest: the last step is not the cause of lassitude: it does not confess it.
 Every day travels towards death; the last only arrives at it." These are
 the good lessons our mother Nature teaches.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have often considered with myself whence it should proceed, that in war
 the image of death, whether we look upon it in ourselves or in others,
 should, without comparison, appear less dreadful than at home in our own
 houses (for if it were not so, it would be an army of doctors and whining
 milksops), and that being still in all places the same, there should be,
 notwithstanding, much more assurance in peasants and the meaner sort of
 people, than in others of better quality. I believe, in truth, that it is
 those terrible ceremonies and preparations wherewith we set it out, that
 more terrify us than the thing itself; a new, quite contrary way of
 living; the cries of mothers, wives, and children; the visits of astounded
 and afflicted friends; the attendance of pale and blubbering servants; a
 dark room, set round with burning tapers; our beds environed with
 physicians and divines; in sum, nothing but ghostliness and horror round
 about us; we seem dead and buried already. Children are afraid even of
 those they are best acquainted with, when disguised in a visor; and so
 'tis with us; the visor must be removed as well from things as from
 persons, that being taken away, we shall find nothing underneath but the
 very same death that a mean servant or a poor chambermaid died a day or
 two ago, without any manner of apprehension. Happy is the death that
 deprives us of leisure for preparing such ceremonials.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XX??OF THE FORCE OF IMAGINATION
 </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Fortis imaginatio generat casum," say the schoolmen.

 ["A strong imagination begets the event itself."?Axiom. Scholast.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I am one of those who are most sensible of the power of imagination: every
 one is jostled by it, but some are overthrown by it. It has a very
 piercing impression upon me; and I make it my business to avoid, wanting
 force to resist it. I could live by the sole help of healthful and jolly
 company: the very sight of another's pain materially pains me, and I often
 usurp the sensations of another person. A perpetual cough in another
 tickles my lungs and throat. I more unwillingly visit the sick in whom by
 love and duty I am interested, than those I care not for, to whom I less
 look. I take possession of the disease I am concerned at, and take it to
 myself. I do not at all wonder that fancy should give fevers and sometimes
 kill such as allow it too much scope, and are too willing to entertain it.
 Simon Thomas was a great physician of his time: I remember, that happening
 one day at Toulouse to meet him at a rich old fellow's house, who was
 troubled with weak lungs, and discoursing with the patient about the
 method of his cure, he told him, that one thing which would be very
 conducive to it, was to give me such occasion to be pleased with his
 company, that I might come often to see him, by which means, and by fixing
 his eyes upon the freshness of my complexion, and his imagination upon the
 sprightliness and vigour that glowed in my youth, and possessing all his
 senses with the flourishing age wherein I then was, his habit of body
 might, peradventure, be amended; but he forgot to say that mine, at the
 same time, might be made worse. Gallus Vibius so much bent his mind to
 find out the essence and motions of madness, that, in the end, he himself
 went out of his wits, and to such a degree, that he could never after
 recover his judgment, and might brag that he was become a fool by too much
 wisdom. Some there are who through fear anticipate the hangman; and there
 was the man, whose eyes being unbound to have his pardon read to him, was
 found stark dead upon the scaffold, by the stroke of imagination. We
 start, tremble, turn pale, and blush, as we are variously moved by
 imagination; and, being a-bed, feel our bodies agitated with its power to
 that degree, as even sometimes to expiring. And boiling youth, when fast
 asleep, grows so warm with fancy, as in a dream to satisfy amorous
 desires:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ut, quasi transactis saepe omnibu rebu, profundant
 Fluminis ingentes, fluctus, vestemque cruentent."
</pre>
 <p>
 Although it be no new thing to see horns grown in a night on the forehead
 of one that had none when he went to bed, notwithstanding, what befell
 Cippus, King of Italy, is memorable; who having one day been a very
 delighted spectator of a bullfight, and having all the night dreamed that
 he had horns on his head, did, by the force of imagination, really cause
 them to grow there. Passion gave to the son of Croesus the voice which
 nature had denied him. And Antiochus fell into a fever, inflamed with the
 beauty of Stratonice, too deeply imprinted in his soul. Pliny pretends to
 have seen Lucius Cossitius, who from a woman was turned into a man upon
 her very wedding-day. Pontanus and others report the like metamorphosis to
 have happened in these latter days in Italy. And, through the vehement
 desire of him and his mother:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Volta puer solvit, quae foemina voverat, Iphis."
</pre>
 <p>
 Myself passing by Vitry le Francois, saw a man the Bishop of Soissons had,
 in confirmation, called Germain, whom all the inhabitants of the place had
 known to be a girl till two-and-twenty years of age, called Mary. He was,
 at the time of my being there, very full of beard, old, and not married.
 He told us, that by straining himself in a leap his male organs came out;
 and the girls of that place have, to this day, a song, wherein they advise
 one another not to take too great strides, for fear of being turned into
 men, as Mary Germain was. It is no wonder if this sort of accident
 frequently happen; for if imagination have any power in such things, it is
 so continually and vigorously bent upon this subject, that to the end it
 may not so often relapse into the same thought and violence of desire, it
 were better, once for all, to give these young wenches the things they
 long for.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some attribute the scars of King Dagobert and of St. Francis to the force
 of imagination. It is said, that by it bodies will sometimes be removed
 from their places; and Celsus tells us of a priest whose soul would be
 ravished into such an ecstasy that the body would, for a long time, remain
 without sense or respiration. St. Augustine makes mention of another, who,
 upon the hearing of any lamentable or doleful cries, would presently fall
 into a swoon, and be so far out of himself, that it was in vain to call,
 bawl in his ears, pinch or burn him, till he voluntarily came to himself;
 and then he would say, that he had heard voices as it were afar off, and
 did feel when they pinched and burned him; and, to prove that this was no
 obstinate dissimulation in defiance of his sense of feeling, it was
 manifest, that all the while he had neither pulse nor breathing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis very probable, that visions, enchantments, and all extraordinary
 effects of that nature, derive their credit principally from the power of
 imagination, working and making its chiefest impression upon vulgar and
 more easy souls, whose belief is so strangely imposed upon, as to think
 they see what they do not see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I am not satisfied whether those pleasant ligatures?[Les nouements
 d'aiguillettes, as they were called, knots tied by some one, at a wedding,
 on a strip of leather, cotton, or silk, and which, especially when passed
 through the wedding-ring, were supposed to have the magical effect of
 preventing a consummation of the marriage until they were untied. See
 Louandre, La Sorcellerie, 1853, p. 73. The same superstition and appliance
 existed in England.]?with which this age of ours is so occupied,
 that there is almost no other talk, are not mere voluntary impressions of
 apprehension and fear; for I know, by experience, in the case of a
 particular friend of mine, one for whom I can be as responsible as for
 myself, and a man that cannot possibly fall under any manner of suspicion
 of insufficiency, and as little of being enchanted, who having heard a
 companion of his make a relation of an unusual frigidity that surprised
 him at a very unseasonable time; being afterwards himself engaged upon the
 same account, the horror of the former story on a sudden so strangely
 possessed his imagination, that he ran the same fortune the other had
 done; and from that time forward, the scurvy remembrance of his disaster
 running in his mind and tyrannising over him, he was subject to relapse
 into the same misfortune. He found some remedy, however, for this fancy in
 another fancy, by himself frankly confessing and declaring beforehand to
 the party with whom he was to have to do, this subjection of his, by which
 means, the agitation of his soul was, in some sort, appeased; and knowing
 that, now, some such misbehaviour was expected from him, the restraint
 upon his faculties grew less. And afterwards, at such times as he was in
 no such apprehension, when setting about the act (his thoughts being then
 disengaged and free, and his body in its true and natural estate) he was
 at leisure to cause the part to be handled and communicated to the
 knowledge of the other party, he was totally freed from that vexatious
 infirmity. After a man has once done a woman right, he is never after in
 danger of misbehaving himself with that person, unless upon the account of
 some excusable weakness. Neither is this disaster to be feared, but in
 adventures, where the soul is overextended with desire or respect, and,
 especially, where the opportunity is of an unforeseen and pressing nature;
 in those cases, there is no means for a man to defend himself from such a
 surprise, as shall put him altogether out of sorts. I have known some, who
 have secured themselves from this mischance, by coming half sated
 elsewhere, purposely to abate the ardour of the fury, and others, who,
 being grown old, find themselves less impotent by being less able; and
 one, who found an advantage in being assured by a friend of his, that he
 had a counter-charm of enchantments that would secure him from this
 disgrace. The story itself is not, much amiss, and therefore you shall
 have it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A Count of a very great family, and with whom I was very intimate, being
 married to a fair lady, who had formerly been courted by one who was at
 the wedding, all his friends were in very great fear; but especially an
 old lady his kinswoman, who had the ordering of the solemnity, and in
 whose house it was kept, suspecting his rival would offer foul play by
 these sorceries. Which fear she communicated to me. I bade her rely upon
 me: I had, by chance, about me a certain flat plate of gold, whereon were
 graven some celestial figures, supposed good against sunstroke or pains in
 the head, being applied to the suture: where, that it might the better
 remain firm, it was sewed to a ribbon to be tied under the chin; a foppery
 cousin-german to this of which I am speaking. Jaques Pelletier, who lived
 in my house, had presented this to me for a singular rarity. I had a fancy
 to make some use of this knack, and therefore privately told the Count,
 that he might possibly run the same fortune other bridegrooms had
 sometimes done, especially some one being in the house, who, no doubt,
 would be glad to do him such a courtesy: but let him boldly go to bed. For
 I would do him the office of a friend, and, if need were, would not spare
 a miracle it was in my power to do, provided he would engage to me, upon
 his honour, to keep it to himself; and only, when they came to bring him
 his caudle,?[A custom in France to bring the bridegroom a caudle in
 the middle of the night on his wedding-night]? if matters had not
 gone well with him, to give me such a sign, and leave the rest to me. Now
 he had had his ears so battered, and his mind so prepossessed with the
 eternal tattle of this business, that when he came to't, he did really
 find himself tied with the trouble of his imagination, and, accordingly,
 at the time appointed, gave me the sign. Whereupon, I whispered him in the
 ear, that he should rise, under pretence of putting us out of the room,
 and after a jesting manner pull my nightgown from my shoulders?we
 were of much about the same height? throw it over his own, and there
 keep it till he had performed what I had appointed him to do, which was,
 that when we were all gone out of the chamber, he should withdraw to make
 water, should three times repeat such and such words, and as often do such
 and such actions; that at every of the three times, he should tie the
 ribbon I put into his hand about his middle, and be sure to place the
 medal that was fastened to it, the figures in such a posture, exactly upon
 his reins, which being done, and having the last of the three times so
 well girt and fast tied the ribbon that it could neither untie nor slip
 from its place, let him confidently return to his business, and withal not
 forget to spread my gown upon the bed, so that it might be sure to cover
 them both. These ape's tricks are the main of the effect, our fancy being
 so far seduced as to believe that such strange means must, of necessity,
 proceed from some abstruse science: their very inanity gives them weight
 and reverence. And, certain it is, that my figures approved themselves
 more venereal than solar, more active than prohibitive. 'Twas a sudden
 whimsey, mixed with a little curiosity, that made me do a thing so
 contrary to my nature; for I am an enemy to all subtle and counterfeit
 actions, and abominate all manner of trickery, though it be for sport, and
 to an advantage; for though the action may not be vicious in itself, its
 mode is vicious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Amasis, King of Egypt, having married Laodice, a very beautiful Greek
 virgin, though noted for his abilities elsewhere, found himself quite
 another man with his wife, and could by no means enjoy her; at which he
 was so enraged, that he threatened to kill her, suspecting her to be a
 witch. As 'tis usual in things that consist in fancy, she put him upon
 devotion, and having accordingly made his vows to Venus, he found himself
 divinely restored the very first night after his oblations and sacrifices.
 Now women are to blame to entertain us with that disdainful, coy, and
 angry countenance, which extinguishes our vigour, as it kindles our
 desire; which made the daughter-in-law of Pythagoras?[Theano, the
 lady in question was the wife, not the daughter-in-law of Pythagoras.]?
 say, "That the woman who goes to bed to a man, must put off her modesty
 with her petticoat, and put it on again with the same." The soul of the
 assailant, being disturbed with many several alarms, readily loses the
 power of performance; and whoever the imagination has once put this trick
 upon, and confounded with the shame of it (and she never does it but at
 the first acquaintance, by reason men are then more ardent and eager, and
 also, at this first account a man gives of himself, he is much more
 timorous of miscarrying), having made an ill beginning, he enters into
 such fever and despite at the accident, as are apt to remain and continue
 with him upon following occasions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Married people, having all their time before them, ought never to compel
 or so much as to offer at the feat, if they do not find themselves quite
 ready: and it is less unseemly to fail of handselling the nuptial sheets,
 when a man perceives himself full of agitation and trembling, and to await
 another opportunity at more private and more composed leisure, than to
 make himself perpetually miserable, for having misbehaved himself and been
 baffled at the first assault. Till possession be taken, a man that knows
 himself subject to this infirmity, should leisurely and by degrees make
 several little trials and light offers, without obstinately attempting at
 once, to Force an absolute conquest over his own mutinous and indisposed
 faculties. Such as know their members to be naturally obedient, need take
 no other care but only to counterplot their fantasies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The indocile liberty of this member is very remarkable, so importunately
 unruly in its tumidity and impatience, when we do not require it, and so
 unseasonably disobedient, when we stand most in need of it: so imperiously
 contesting in authority with the will, and with so much haughty obstinacy
 denying all solicitation, both of hand and mind. And yet, though his
 rebellion is so universally complained of, and that proof is thence
 deduced to condemn him, if he had, nevertheless, feed me to plead his
 cause, I should peradventure, bring the rest of his fellow-members into
 suspicion of complotting this mischief against him, out of pure envy at
 the importance and pleasure especial to his employment; and to have, by
 confederacy, armed the whole world against him, by malevolently charging
 him alone, with their common offence. For let any one consider, whether
 there is any one part of our bodies that does not often refuse to perform
 its office at the precept of the will, and that does not often exercise
 its function in defiance of her command. They have every one of them
 passions of their own, that rouse and awaken, stupefy and benumb them,
 without our leave or consent. How often do the involuntary motions of the
 countenance discover our inward thoughts, and betray our most private
 secrets to the bystanders. The same cause that animates this member, does
 also, without our knowledge, animate the lungs, pulse, and heart, the
 sight of a pleasing object imperceptibly diffusing a flame through all our
 parts, with a feverish motion. Is there nothing but these veins and
 muscles that swell and flag without the consent, not only of the will, but
 even of our knowledge also? We do not command our hairs to stand on end,
 nor our skin to shiver either with fear or desire; the hands often convey
 themselves to parts to which we do not direct them; the tongue will be
 interdict, and the voice congealed, when we know not how to help it. When
 we have nothing to eat, and would willingly forbid it, the appetite does
 not, for all that, forbear to stir up the parts that are subject to it, no
 more nor less than the other appetite we were speaking of, and in like
 manner, as unseasonably leaves us, when it thinks fit. The vessels that
 serve to discharge the belly have their own proper dilatations and
 compressions, without and beyond our concurrence, as well as those which
 are destined to purge the reins; and that which, to justify the
 prerogative of the will, St. Augustine urges, of having seen a man who
 could command his rear to discharge as often together as he pleased,
 Vives, his commentator, yet further fortifies with another example in his
 time,?of one that could break wind in tune; but these cases do not
 suppose any more pure obedience in that part; for is anything commonly
 more tumultuary or indiscreet? To which let me add, that I myself knew one
 so rude and ungoverned, as for forty years together made his master vent
 with one continued and unintermitted outbursting, and 'tis like will do so
 till he die of it. And I could heartily wish, that I only knew by reading,
 how often a man's belly, by the denial of one single puff, brings him to
 the very door of an exceeding painful death; and that the emperor,?[The
 Emperor Claudius, who, however, according to Suetonius (Vita, c. 32), only
 intended to authorise this singular privilege by an edict.]?who gave
 liberty to let fly in all places, had, at the same time, given us power to
 do it. But for our will, in whose behalf we prefer this accusation, with
 how much greater probability may we reproach herself with mutiny and
 sedition, for her irregularity and disobedience? Does she always will what
 we would have her to do? Does she not often will what we forbid her to
 will, and that to our manifest prejudice? Does she suffer herself, more
 than any of the rest, to be governed and directed by the results of our
 reason? To conclude, I should move, in the behalf of the gentleman, my
 client, it might be considered, that in this fact, his cause being
 inseparably and indistinctly conjoined with an accessory, yet he only is
 called in question, and that by arguments and accusations, which cannot be
 charged upon the other; whose business, indeed, it is sometimes
 inopportunely to invite, but never to refuse, and invite, moreover, after
 a tacit and quiet manner; and therefore is the malice and injustice of his
 accusers most manifestly apparent. But be it how it will, protesting
 against the proceedings of the advocates and judges, nature will, in the
 meantime, proceed after her own way, who had done but well, had she
 endowed this member with some particular privilege; the author of the sole
 immortal work of mortals; a divine work, according to Socrates; and love,
 the desire of immortality, and himself an immortal demon.

 Some one, perhaps, by such an effect of imagination may have had the good
 luck to leave behind him here, the scrofula, which his companion who has
 come after, has carried with him into Spain. And 'tis for this reason you
 may see why men in such cases require a mind prepared for the thing that
 is to be done. Why do the physicians possess, before hand, their patients'
 credulity with so many false promises of cure, if not to the end, that the
 effect of imagination may supply the imposture of their decoctions? They
 know very well, that a great master of their trade has given it under his
 hand, that he has known some with whom the very sight of physic would
 work. All which conceits come now into my head, by the remembrance of a
 story was told me by a domestic apothecary of my father's, a blunt Swiss,
 a nation not much addicted to vanity and lying, of a merchant he had long
 known at Toulouse, who being a valetudinary, and much afflicted with the
 stone, had often occasion to take clysters, of which he caused several
 sorts to be prescribed him by the physicians, acccording to the accidents
 of his disease; which, being brought him, and none of the usual forms, as
 feeling if it were not too hot, and the like, being omitted, he lay down,
 the syringe advanced, and all ceremonies performed, injection alone
 excepted; after which, the apothecary being gone, and the patient
 accommodated as if he had really received a clyster, he found the same
 operation and effect that those do who have taken one indeed; and if at
 any time the physician did not find the operation sufficient, he would
 usually give him two or three more doses, after the same manner. And the
 fellow swore, that to save charges (for he paid as if he had really taken
 them) this sick man's wife, having sometimes made trial of warm water
 only, the effect discovered the cheat, and finding these would do no good,
 was fain to return to the old way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A woman fancying she had swallowed a pin in a piece of bread, cried and
 lamented as though she had an intolerable pain in her throat, where she
 thought she felt it stick; but an ingenious fellow that was brought to
 her, seeing no outward tumour nor alteration, supposing it to be only a
 conceit taken at some crust of bread that had hurt her as it went down,
 caused her to vomit, and, unseen, threw a crooked pin into the basin,
 which the woman no sooner saw, but believing she had cast it up, she
 presently found herself eased of her pain. I myself knew a gentleman, who
 having treated a large company at his house, three or four days after
 bragged in jest (for there was no such thing), that he had made them eat
 of a baked cat; at which, a young gentlewoman, who had been at the feast,
 took such a horror, that falling into a violent vomiting and fever, there
 was no possible means to save her. Even brute beasts are subject to the
 force of imagination as well as we; witness dogs, who die of grief for the
 loss of their masters; and bark and tremble and start in their sleep; so
 horses will kick and whinny in their sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now all this may be attributed to the close affinity and relation betwixt
 the soul and the body intercommunicating their fortunes; but 'tis quite
 another thing when the imagination works not only upon one's own
 particular body, but upon that of others also. And as an infected body
 communicates its malady to those that approach or live near it, as we see
 in the plague, the smallpox, and sore eyes, that run through whole
 families and cities:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Dum spectant oculi laesos, laeduntur et ipsi;
 Multaque corporibus transitione nocent."

 ["When we look at people with sore eyes, our own eyes become sore.
 Many things are hurtful to our bodies by transition."
 ?Ovid, De Rem. Amor., 615.]
</pre>
 <p>
 ?so the imagination, being vehemently agitated, darts out infection
 capable of offending the foreign object. The ancients had an opinion of
 certain women of Scythia, that being animated and enraged against any one,
 they killed him only with their looks. Tortoises and ostriches hatch their
 eggs with only looking on them, which infers that their eyes have in them
 some ejaculative virtue. And the eyes of witches are said to be assailant
 and hurtful:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos."

 ["Some eye, I know not whose is bewitching my tender lambs."
 ?Virgil, Eclog., iii. 103.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Magicians are no very good authority with me. But we experimentally see
 that women impart the marks of their fancy to the children they carry in
 the womb; witness her that was brought to bed of a Moor; and there was
 presented to Charles the Emperor and King of Bohemia, a girl from about
 Pisa, all over rough and covered with hair, whom her mother said to be so
 conceived by reason of a picture of St. John the Baptist, that hung within
 the curtains of her bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is the same with beasts; witness Jacob's sheep, and the hares and
 partridges that the snow turns white upon the mountains. There was at my
 house, a little while ago, a cat seen watching a bird upon the top of a
 tree: these, for some time, mutually fixing their eyes one upon another,
 the bird at last let herself fall dead into the cat's claws, either
 dazzled by the force of its own imagination, or drawn by some attractive
 power of the cat. Such as are addicted to the pleasures of the field,
 have, I make no question, heard the story of the falconer, who having
 earnestly fixed his eyes upon a kite in the air; laid a wager that he
 would bring her down with the sole power of his sight, and did so, as it
 was said; for the tales I borrow I charge upon the consciences of those
 from whom I have them. The discourses are my own, and found themselves
 upon the proofs of reason, not of experience; to which every one has
 liberty to add his own examples; and who has none, let him not forbear,
 the number and varieties of accidents considered, to believe that there
 are plenty of them; if I do not apply them well, let some other do it for
 me. And, also, in the subject of which I treat, our manners and motions,
 testimonies and instances; how fabulous soever, provided they are
 possible, serve as well as the true; whether they have really happened or
 no, at Rome or Paris, to John or Peter, 'tis still within the verge of
 human capacity, which serves me to good use. I see, and make my advantage
 of it, as well in shadow as in substance; and amongst the various readings
 thereof in history, I cull out the most rare and memorable to fit my own
 turn. There are authors whose only end and design it is to give an account
 of things that have happened; mine, if I could arrive unto it, should be
 to deliver of what may happen. There is a just liberty allowed in the
 schools, of supposing similitudes, when they have none at hand. I do not,
 however, make any use of that privilege, and as to that matter, in
 superstitious religion, surpass all historical authority. In the examples
 which I here bring in, of what I have heard, read, done, or said, I have
 forbidden myself to dare to alter even the most light and indifferent
 circumstances; my conscience does not falsify one tittle; what my
 ignorance may do, I cannot say.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And this it is that makes me sometimes doubt in my own mind, whether a
 divine, or a philosopher, and such men of exact and tender prudence and
 conscience, are fit to write history: for how can they stake their
 reputation upon a popular faith? how be responsible for the opinions of
 men they do not know? and with what assurance deliver their conjectures
 for current pay? Of actions performed before their own eyes, wherein
 several persons were actors, they would be unwilling to give evidence upon
 oath before a judge; and there is no man, so familiarly known to them, for
 whose intentions they would become absolute caution. For my part, I think
 it less hazardous to write of things past, than present, by how much the
 writer is only to give an account of things every one knows he must of
 necessity borrow upon trust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I am solicited to write the affairs of my own time by some, who fancy I
 look upon them with an eye less blinded with passion than another, and
 have a clearer insight into them by reason of the free access fortune has
 given me to the heads of various factions; but they do not consider, that
 to purchase the glory of Sallust, I would not give myself the trouble,
 sworn enemy as I am to obligation, assiduity, or perseverance: that there
 is nothing so contrary to my style, as a continued narrative, I so often
 interrupt and cut myself short in my writing for want of breath; I have
 neither composition nor explanation worth anything, and am ignorant,
 beyond a child, of the phrases and even the very words proper to express
 the most common things; and for that reason it is, that I have undertaken
 to say only what I can say, and have accommodated my subject to my
 strength. Should I take one to be my guide, peradventure I should not be
 able to keep pace with him; and in the freedom of my liberty might deliver
 judgments, which upon better thoughts, and according to reason, would be
 illegitimate and punishable. Plutarch would say of what he has delivered
 to us, that it is the work of others: that his examples are all and
 everywhere exactly true: that they are useful to posterity, and are
 presented with a lustre that will light us the way to virtue, is his own
 work. It is not of so dangerous consequence, as in a medicinal drug,
 whether an old story be so or so.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXI??THAT THE PROFIT OF ONE MAN IS THE DAMAGE OF
 ANOTHER
 </h2>
 <p>
 Demades the Athenian?[Seneca, De Beneficiis, vi. 38, whence nearly
 the whole of this chapter is taken.]?condemned one of his city,
 whose trade it was to sell the necessaries for funeral ceremonies, upon
 pretence that he demanded unreasonable profit, and that that profit could
 not accrue to him, but by the death of a great number of people. A
 judgment that appears to be ill grounded, forasmuch as no profit whatever
 can possibly be made but at the expense of another, and that by the same
 rule he should condemn all gain of what kind soever. The merchant only
 thrives by the debauchery of youth, the husband man by the dearness of
 grain, the architect by the ruin of buildings, lawyers and officers of
 justice by the suits and contentions of men: nay, even the honour and
 office of divines are derived from our death and vices. A physician takes
 no pleasure in the health even of his friends, says the ancient Greek
 comic writer, nor a soldier in the peace of his country, and so of the
 rest. And, which is yet worse, let every one but dive into his own bosom,
 and he will find his private wishes spring and his secret hopes grow up at
 another's expense. Upon which consideration it comes into my head, that
 nature does not in this swerve from her general polity; for physicians
 hold, that the birth, nourishment, and increase of every thing is the
 dissolution and corruption of another:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,
 Continuo hoc mors est illius, quod fuit ante."

 ["For, whatever from its own confines passes changed, this is at
 once the death of that which before it was."?Lucretius, ii. 752.]

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXII??OF CUSTOM, AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT EASILY CHANGE
 A LAW RECEIVED
 </h2>
 <p>
 He seems to me to have had a right and true apprehension of the power of
 custom, who first invented the story of a country-woman who, having
 accustomed herself to play with and carry a young calf in her arms, and
 daily continuing to do so as it grew up, obtained this by custom, that,
 when grown to be a great ox, she was still able to bear it. For, in truth,
 custom is a violent and treacherous schoolmistress. She, by little and
 little, slily and unperceived, slips in the foot of her authority, but
 having by this gentle and humble beginning, with the benefit of time,
 fixed and established it, she then unmasks a furious and tyrannic
 countenance, against which we have no more the courage or the power so
 much as to lift up our eyes. We see her, at every turn, forcing and
 violating the rules of nature:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Usus efficacissimus rerum omnium magister."

 ["Custom is the best master of all things."
 ?Pliny, Nat. Hist.,xxvi. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I refer to her Plato's cave in his Republic, and the physicians, who so
 often submit the reasons of their art to her authority; as the story of
 that king, who by custom brought his stomach to that pass, as to live by
 poison, and the maid that Albertus reports to have lived upon spiders. In
 that new world of the Indies, there were found great nations, and in very
 differing climates, who were of the same diet, made provision of them, and
 fed them for their tables; as also, they did grasshoppers, mice, lizards,
 and bats; and in a time of scarcity of such delicacies, a toad was sold
 for six crowns, all which they cook, and dish up with several sauces.
 There were also others found, to whom our diet, and the flesh we eat, were
 venomous and mortal:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Consuetudinis magna vis est: pernoctant venatores in nive:
 in montibus uri se patiuntur: pugiles, caestibus contusi,
 ne ingemiscunt quidem."

 ["The power of custom is very great: huntsmen will lie out all
 night in the snow, or suffer themselves to be burned up by the sun
 on the mountains; boxers, hurt by the caestus, never utter a
 groan."?Cicero, Tusc., ii. 17]
</pre>
 <p>
 These strange examples will not appear so strange if we consider what we
 have ordinary experience of, how much custom stupefies our senses. We need
 not go to what is reported of the people about the cataracts of the Nile;
 and what philosophers believe of the music of the spheres, that the bodies
 of those circles being solid and smooth, and coming to touch and rub upon
 one another, cannot fail of creating a marvellous harmony, the changes and
 cadences of which cause the revolutions and dances of the stars; but that
 the hearing sense of all creatures here below, being universally, like
 that of the Egyptians, deafened, and stupefied with the continual noise,
 cannot, how great soever, perceive it?[This passage is taken from
 Cicero, "Dream of Scipio"; see his De Republica, vi. II. The Egyptians
 were said to be stunned by the noise of the Cataracts.]? Smiths,
 millers, pewterers, forgemen, and armourers could never be able to live in
 the perpetual noise of their own trades, did it strike their ears with the
 same violence that it does ours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My perfumed doublet gratifies my own scent at first; but after I have worn
 it three days together, 'tis only pleasing to the bystanders. This is yet
 more strange, that custom, notwithstanding long intermissions and
 intervals, should yet have the power to unite and establish the effect of
 its impressions upon our senses, as is manifest in such as live near unto
 steeples and the frequent noise of the bells. I myself lie at home in a
 tower, where every morning and evening a very great bell rings out the Ave
 Maria: the noise shakes my very tower, and at first seemed insupportable
 to me; but I am so used to it, that I hear it without any manner of
 offence, and often without awaking at it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plato?[Diogenes Laertius, iii. 38. But he whom Plato censured was
 not a boy playing at nuts, but a man throwing dice.]?reprehending a
 boy for playing at nuts, "Thou reprovest me," says the boy, "for a very
 little thing." "Custom," replied Plato, "is no little thing." I find that
 our greatest vices derive their first propensity from our most tender
 infancy, and that our principal education depends upon the nurse. Mothers
 are mightily pleased to see a child writhe off the neck of a chicken, or
 to please itself with hurting a dog or a cat; and such wise fathers there
 are in the world, who look upon it as a notable mark of a martial spirit,
 when they hear a son miscall, or see him domineer over a poor peasant, or
 a lackey, that dares not reply, nor turn again; and a great sign of wit,
 when they see him cheat and overreach his playfellow by some malicious
 treachery and deceit. Yet these are the true seeds and roots of cruelty,
 tyranny, and treason; they bud and put out there, and afterwards shoot up
 vigorously, and grow to prodigious bulk, cultivated by custom. And it is a
 very dangerous mistake to excuse these vile inclinations upon the
 tenderness of their age, and the triviality of the subject: first, it is
 nature that speaks, whose declaration is then more sincere, and inward
 thoughts more undisguised, as it is more weak and young; secondly, the
 deformity of cozenage does not consist nor depend upon the difference
 betwixt crowns and pins; but I rather hold it more just to conclude thus:
 why should he not cozen in crowns since he does it in pins, than as they
 do, who say they only play for pins, they would not do it if it were for
 money? Children should carefully be instructed to abhor vices for their
 own contexture; and the natural deformity of those vices ought so to be
 represented to them, that they may not only avoid them in their actions,
 but especially so to abominate them in their hearts, that the very thought
 should be hateful to them, with what mask soever they may be disguised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I know very well, for what concerns myself, that from having been brought
 up in my childhood to a plain and straightforward way of dealing, and from
 having had an aversion to all manner of juggling and foul play in my
 childish sports and recreations (and, indeed, it is to be noted, that the
 plays of children are not performed in play, but are to be judged in them
 as their most serious actions), there is no game so small wherein from my
 own bosom naturally, and without study or endeavour, I have not an extreme
 aversion from deceit. I shuffle and cut and make as much clatter with the
 cards, and keep as strict account for farthings, as it were for double
 pistoles; when winning or losing against my wife and daughter, 'tis
 indifferent to me, as when I play in good earnest with others, for round
 sums. At all times, and in all places, my own eyes are sufficient to look
 to my fingers; I am not so narrowly watched by any other, neither is there
 any I have more respect to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I saw the other day, at my own house, a little fellow, a native of Nantes,
 born without arms, who has so well taught his feet to perform the services
 his hands should have done him, that truly these have half forgotten their
 natural office; and, indeed, the fellow calls them his hands; with them he
 cuts anything, charges and discharges a pistol, threads a needle, sews,
 writes, puts off his hat, combs his head, plays at cards and dice, and all
 this with as much dexterity as any other could do who had more, and more
 proper limbs to assist him. The money I gave him?for he gains his
 living by shewing these feats?he took in his foot, as we do in our
 hand. I have seen another who, being yet a boy, flourished a two-handed
 sword, and, if I may so say, handled a halberd with the mere motions of
 his neck and shoulders for want of hands; tossed them into the air, and
 caught them again, darted a dagger, and cracked a whip as well as any
 coachman in France.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the effects of custom are much more manifest in the strange
 impressions she imprints in our minds, where she meets with less
 resistance. What has she not the power to impose upon our judgments and
 beliefs? Is there any so fantastic opinion (omitting the gross impostures
 of religions, with which we see so many great nations, and so many
 understanding men, so strangely besotted; for this being beyond the reach
 of human reason, any error is more excusable in such as are not endued,
 through the divine bounty, with an extraordinary illumination from above),
 but, of other opinions, are there any so extravagant, that she has not
 planted and established for laws in those parts of the world upon which
 she has been pleased to exercise her power? And therefore that ancient
 exclamation was exceeding just:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non pudet physicum, id est speculatorem venatoremque naturae,
 ab animis consuetudine imbutis petere testimonium veritatis?"

 ["Is it not a shame for a natural philosopher, that is, for an
 observer and hunter of nature, to seek testimony of the truth from
 minds prepossessed by custom?"?Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 30.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I do believe, that no so absurd or ridiculous fancy can enter into human
 imagination, that does not meet with some example of public practice, and
 that, consequently, our reason does not ground and back up. There are
 people, amongst whom it is the fashion to turn their backs upon him they
 salute, and never look upon the man they intend to honour. There is a
 place, where, whenever the king spits, the greatest ladies of his court
 put out their hands to receive it; and another nation, where the most
 eminent persons about him stoop to take up his ordure in a linen cloth.
 Let us here steal room to insert a story.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A French gentleman was always wont to blow his nose with his fingers (a
 thing very much against our fashion), and he justifying himself for so
 doing, and he was a man famous for pleasant repartees, he asked me, what
 privilege this filthy excrement had, that we must carry about us a fine
 handkerchief to receive it, and, which was more, afterwards to lap it
 carefully up, and carry it all day about in our pockets, which, he said,
 could not but be much more nauseous and offensive, than to see it thrown
 away, as we did all other evacuations. I found that what he said was not
 altogether without reason, and by being frequently in his company, that
 slovenly action of his was at last grown familiar to me; which
 nevertheless we make a face at, when we hear it reported of another
 country. Miracles appear to be so, according to our ignorance of nature,
 and not according to the essence of nature the continually being
 accustomed to anything, blinds the eye of our judgment. Barbarians are no
 more a wonder to us, than we are to them; nor with any more reason, as
 every one would confess, if after having travelled over those remote
 examples, men could settle themselves to reflect upon, and rightly to
 confer them, with their own. Human reason is a tincture almost equally
 infused into all our opinions and manners, of what form soever they are;
 infinite in matter, infinite in diversity. But I return to my subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There are peoples, where, his wife and children excepted, no one speaks to
 the king but through a tube. In one and the same nation, the virgins
 discover those parts that modesty should persuade them to hide, and the
 married women carefully cover and conceal them. To which, this custom, in
 another place, has some relation, where chastity, but in marriage, is of
 no esteem, for unmarried women may prostitute themselves to as many as
 they please, and being got with child, may lawfully take physic, in the
 sight of every one, to destroy their fruit. And, in another place, if a
 tradesman marry, all of the same condition, who are invited to the
 wedding, lie with the bride before him; and the greater number of them
 there is, the greater is her honour, and the opinion of her ability and
 strength: if an officer marry, 'tis the same, the same with a labourer, or
 one of mean condition; but then it belongs to the lord of the place to
 perform that office; and yet a severe loyalty during marriage is afterward
 strictly enjoined. There are places where brothels of young men are kept
 for the pleasure of women; where the wives go to war as well as the
 husbands, and not only share in the dangers of battle, but, moreover, in
 the honours of command. Others, where they wear rings not only through
 their noses, lips, cheeks, and on their toes, but also weighty gimmals of
 gold thrust through their paps and buttocks; where, in eating, they wipe
 their fingers upon their thighs, genitories, and the soles of their feet:
 where children are excluded, and brothers and nephews only inherit; and
 elsewhere, nephews only, saving in the succession of the prince: where,
 for the regulation of community in goods and estates, observed in the
 country, certain sovereign magistrates have committed to them the
 universal charge and overseeing of the agriculture, and distribution of
 the fruits, according to the necessity of every one where they lament the
 death of children, and feast at the decease of old men: where they lie ten
 or twelve in a bed, men and their wives together: where women, whose
 husbands come to violent ends, may marry again, and others not: where the
 condition of women is looked upon with such contempt, that they kill all
 the native females, and buy wives of their neighbours to supply their use;
 where husbands may repudiate their wives, without showing any cause, but
 wives cannot part from their husbands, for what cause soever; where
 husbands may sell their wives in case of sterility; where they boil the
 bodies of their dead, and afterward pound them to a pulp, which they mix
 with their wine, and drink it; where the most coveted sepulture is to be
 eaten by dogs, and elsewhere by birds; where they believe the souls of the
 blessed live in all manner of liberty, in delightful fields, furnished
 with all sorts of delicacies, and that it is these souls, repeating the
 words we utter, which we call Echo; where they fight in the water, and
 shoot their arrows with the most mortal aim, swimming; where, for a sign
 of subjection, they lift up their shoulders, and hang down their heads;
 where they put off their shoes when they enter the king's palace; where
 the eunuchs, who take charge of the sacred women, have, moreover, their
 lips and noses cut off, that they may not be loved; where the priests put
 out their own eyes, to be better acquainted with their demons, and the
 better to receive their oracles; where every one makes to himself a deity
 of what he likes best; the hunter of a lion or a fox, the fisher of some
 fish; idols of every human action or passion; in which place, the sun, the
 moon, and the earth are the 'principal deities, and the form of taking an
 oath is, to touch the earth, looking up to heaven; where both flesh and
 fish is eaten raw; where the greatest oath they take is, to swear by the
 name of some dead person of reputation, laying their hand upon his tomb;
 where the newyear's gift the king sends every year to the princes, his
 vassals, is fire, which being brought, all the old fire is put out, and
 the neighbouring people are bound to fetch of the new, every one for
 themselves, upon pain of high treason; where, when the king, to betake
 himself wholly to devotion, retires from his administration (which often
 falls out), his next successor is obliged to do the same, and the right of
 the kingdom devolves to the third in succession: where they vary the form
 of government, according to the seeming necessity of affairs: depose the
 king when they think good, substituting certain elders to govern in his
 stead, and sometimes transferring it into the hands of the commonality:
 where men and women are both circumcised and also baptized: where the
 soldier, who in one or several engagements, has been so fortunate as to
 present seven of the enemies' heads to the king, is made noble: where they
 live in that rare and unsociable opinion of the mortality of the soul:
 where the women are delivered without pain or fear: where the women wear
 copper leggings upon both legs, and if a louse bite them, are bound in
 magnanimity to bite them again, and dare not marry, till first they have
 made their king a tender of their virginity, if he please to accept it:
 where the ordinary way of salutation is by putting a finger down to the
 earth, and then pointing it up toward heaven: where men carry burdens upon
 their heads, and women on their shoulders; where the women make water
 standing, and the men squatting: where they send their blood in token of
 friendship, and offer incense to the men they would honour, like gods:
 where, not only to the fourth, but in any other remote degree, kindred are
 not permitted to marry: where the children are four years at nurse, and
 often twelve; in which place, also, it is accounted mortal to give the
 child suck the first day after it is born: where the correction of the
 male children is peculiarly designed to the fathers, and to the mothers of
 the girls; the punishment being to hang them by the heels in the smoke:
 where they circumcise the women: where they eat all sorts of herbs,
 without other scruple than of the badness of the smell: where all things
 are open the finest houses, furnished in the richest manner, without
 doors, windows, trunks, or chests to lock, a thief being there punished
 double what they are in other places: where they crack lice with their
 teeth like monkeys, and abhor to see them killed with one's nails: where
 in all their lives they neither cut their hair nor pare their nails; and,
 in another place, pare those of the right hand only, letting the left grow
 for ornament and bravery: where they suffer the hair on the right side to
 grow as long as it will, and shave the other; and in the neighbouring
 provinces, some let their hair grow long before, and some behind, shaving
 close the rest: where parents let out their children, and husbands their
 wives, to their guests to hire: where a man may get his own mother with
 child, and fathers make use of their own daughters or sons, without
 scandal: where, at their solemn feasts, they interchangeably lend their
 children to one another, without any consideration of nearness of blood.
 In one place, men feed upon human flesh; in another, 'tis reputed a pious
 office for a man to kill his father at a certain age; elsewhere, the
 fathers dispose of their children, whilst yet in their mothers' wombs,
 some to be preserved and carefully brought up, and others to be abandoned
 or made away. Elsewhere the old husbands lend their wives to young men;
 and in another place they are in common without offence; in one place
 particularly, the women take it for a mark of honour to have as many gay
 fringed tassels at the bottom of their garment, as they have lain with
 several men. Moreover, has not custom made a republic of women separately
 by themselves? has it not put arms into their hands, and made them raise
 armies and fight battles? And does she not, by her own precept, instruct
 the most ignorant vulgar, and make them perfect in things which all the
 philosophy in the world could never beat into the heads of the wisest men?
 For we know entire nations, where death was not only despised, but
 entertained with the greatest triumph; where children of seven years old
 suffered themselves to be whipped to death, without changing countenance;
 where riches were in such contempt, that the meanest citizen would not
 have deigned to stoop to take up a purse of crowns. And we know regions,
 very fruitful in all manner of provisions, where, notwithstanding, the
 most ordinary diet, and that they are most pleased with, is only bread,
 cresses, and water. Did not custom, moreover, work that miracle in Chios
 that, in seven hundred years, it was never known that ever maid or wife
 committed any act to the prejudice of her honour?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To conclude; there is nothing, in my opinion, that she does not, or may
 not do; and therefore, with very good reason it is that Pindar calls her
 the ruler of the world. He that was seen to beat his father, and reproved
 for so doing, made answer, that it was the custom of their family; that,
 in like manner, his father had beaten his grandfather, his grandfather his
 great-grandfather, "And this," says he, pointing to his son, "when he
 comes to my age, shall beat me." And the father, whom the son dragged and
 hauled along the streets, commanded him to stop at a certain door, for he
 himself, he said, had dragged his father no farther, that being the utmost
 limit of the hereditary outrage the sons used to practise upon the fathers
 in their family. It is as much by custom as infirmity, says Aristotle,
 that women tear their hair, bite their nails, and eat coals and earth, and
 more by custom than nature that men abuse themselves with one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature,
 proceed from custom; every one, having an inward veneration for the
 opinions and manners approved and received amongst his own people, cannot,
 without very great reluctance, depart from them, nor apply himself to them
 without applause. In times past, when those of Crete would curse any one,
 they prayed the gods to engage him in some ill custom. But the principal
 effect of its power is, so to seize and ensnare us, that it is hardly in
 us to disengage ourselves from its gripe, or so to come to ourselves, as
 to consider of and to weigh the things it enjoins. To say the truth, by
 reason that we suck it in with our milk, and that the face of the world
 presents itself in this posture to our first sight, it seems as if we were
 born upon condition to follow on this track; and the common fancies that
 we find in repute everywhere about us, and infused into our minds with the
 seed of our fathers, appear to be the most universal and genuine; from
 whence it comes to pass, that whatever is off the hinges of custom, is
 believed to be also off the hinges of reason; how unreasonably for the
 most part, God knows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If, as we who study ourselves have learned to do, every one who hears a
 good sentence, would immediately consider how it does in any way touch his
 own private concern, every one would find, that it was not so much a good
 saying, as a severe lash to the ordinary stupidity of his own judgment:
 but men receive the precepts and admonitions of truth, as directed to the
 common sort, and never to themselves; and instead of applying them to
 their own manners, do only very ignorantly and unprofitably commit them to
 memory. But let us return to the empire of custom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such people as have been bred up to liberty, and subject to no other
 dominion but the authority of their own will, look upon all other form of
 government as monstrous and contrary to nature. Those who are inured to
 monarchy do the same; and what opportunity soever fortune presents them
 with to change, even then, when with the greatest difficulties they have
 disengaged themselves from one master, that was troublesome and grievous
 to them, they presently run, with the same difficulties, to create
 another; being unable to take into hatred subjection itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis by the mediation of custom, that every one is content with the place
 where he is planted by nature; and the Highlanders of Scotland no more
 pant after Touraine; than the Scythians after Thessaly. Darius asking
 certain Greeks what they would take to assume the custom of the Indians,
 of eating the dead bodies of their fathers (for that was their use,
 believing they could not give them a better nor more noble sepulture than
 to bury them in their own bodies), they made answer, that nothing in the
 world should hire them to do it; but having also tried to persuade the
 Indians to leave their custom, and, after the Greek manner, to burn the
 bodies of their fathers, they conceived a still greater horror at the
 motion.?[Herodotus, iii. 38.]?Every one does the same, for use
 veils from us the true aspect of things.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nil adeo magnum, nec tam mirabile quidquam
 Principio, quod non minuant mirarier omnes Paullatim."

 ["There is nothing at first so grand, so admirable, which by degrees
 people do not regard with less admiration."?Lucretius, ii. 1027]
</pre>
 <p>
 Taking upon me once to justify something in use amongst us, and that was
 received with absolute authority for a great many leagues round about us,
 and not content, as men commonly do, to establish it only by force of law
 and example, but inquiring still further into its origin, I found the
 foundation so weak, that I who made it my business to confirm others, was
 very near being dissatisfied myself. 'Tis by this receipt that Plato
 ?[Laws, viii. 6.]?undertakes to cure the unnatural and
 preposterous loves of his time, as one which he esteems of sovereign
 virtue, namely, that the public opinion condemns them; that the poets, and
 all other sorts of writers, relate horrible stories of them; a recipe, by
 virtue of which the most beautiful daughters no more allure their fathers'
 lust; nor brothers, of the finest shape and fashion, their sisters'
 desire; the very fables of Thyestes, OEdipus, and Macareus, having with
 the harmony of their song, infused this wholesome opinion and belief into
 the tender brains of children. Chastity is, in truth, a great and shining
 virtue, and of which the utility is sufficiently known; but to treat of
 it, and to set it off in its true value, according to nature, is as hard
 as 'tis easy to do so according to custom, laws, and precepts. The
 fundamental and universal reasons are of very obscure and difficult
 research, and our masters either lightly pass them over, or not daring so
 much as to touch them, precipitate themselves into the liberty and
 protection of custom, there puffing themselves out and triumphing to their
 heart's content: such as will not suffer themselves to be withdrawn from
 this original source, do yet commit a greater error, and subject
 themselves to wild opinions; witness Chrysippus,?[Sextus Empiricus,
 Pyyrhon. Hypotyp., i. 14.]?who, in so many of his writings, has
 strewed the little account he made of incestuous conjunctions, committed
 with how near relations soever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whoever would disengage himself from this violent prejudice of custom,
 would find several things received with absolute and undoubting opinion,
 that have no other support than the hoary head and rivelled face of
 ancient usage. But the mask taken off, and things being referred to the
 decision of truth and reason, he will find his judgment as it were
 altogether overthrown, and yet restored to a much more sure estate. For
 example, I shall ask him, what can be more strange than to see a people
 obliged to obey laws they never understood; bound in all their domestic
 affairs, as marriages, donations, wills, sales, and purchases, to rules
 they cannot possibly know, being neither written nor published in their
 own language, and of which they are of necessity to purchase both the
 interpretation and the use? Not according to the ingenious opinion of
 Isocrates,?[Discourse to Nicocles.]?who counselled his king to
 make the traffics and negotiations of his subjects, free, frank, and of
 profit to them, and their quarrels and disputes burdensome, and laden with
 heavy impositions and penalties; but, by a prodigious opinion, to make
 sale of reason itself, and to give to laws a course of merchandise. I
 think myself obliged to fortune that, as our historians report, it was a
 Gascon gentleman, a countryman of mine, who first opposed Charlemagne,
 when he attempted to impose upon us Latin and imperial laws.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What can be more savage, than to see a nation where, by lawful custom, the
 office of a judge is bought and sold, where judgments are paid for with
 ready money, and where justice may legitimately be denied to him that has
 not wherewithal to pay; a merchandise in so great repute, as in a
 government to create a fourth estate of wrangling lawyers, to add to the
 three ancient ones of the church, nobility, and people; which fourth
 estate, having the laws in their own hands, and sovereign power over men's
 lives and fortunes, makes another body separate from nobility: whence it
 comes to pass, that there are double laws, those of honour and those of
 justice, in many things altogether opposite one to another; the nobles as
 rigorously condemning a lie taken, as the other do a lie revenged: by the
 law of arms, he shall be degraded from all nobility and honour who puts up
 with an affront; and by the civil law, he who vindicates his reputation by
 revenge incurs a capital punishment: he who applies himself to the law for
 reparation of an offence done to his honour, disgraces himself; and he who
 does not, is censured and punished by the law. Yet of these two so
 different things, both of them referring to one head, the one has the
 charge of peace, the other of war; those have the profit, these the
 honour; those the wisdom, these the virtue; those the word, these the
 action; those justice, these valour; those reason, these force; those the
 long robe, these the short;?divided betwixt them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For what concerns indifferent things, as clothes, who is there seeking to
 bring them back to their true use, which is the body's service and
 convenience, and upon which their original grace and fitness depend; for
 the most fantastic, in my opinion, that can be imagined, I will instance
 amongst others, our flat caps, that long tail of velvet that hangs down
 from our women's heads, with its party-coloured trappings; and that vain
 and futile model of a member we cannot in modesty so much as name, which,
 nevertheless, we make show and parade of in public. These considerations,
 notwithstanding, will not prevail upon any understanding man to decline
 the common mode; but, on the contrary, methinks, all singular and
 particular fashions are rather marks of folly and vain affectation than of
 sound reason, and that a wise man, within, ought to withdraw and retire
 his soul from the crowd, and there keep it at liberty and in power to
 judge freely of things; but as to externals, absolutely to follow and
 conform himself to the fashion of the time. Public society has nothing to
 do with our thoughts, but the rest, as our actions, our labours, our
 fortunes, and our lives, we are to lend and abandon them to its service
 and to the common opinion, as did that good and great Socrates who refused
 to preserve his life by a disobedience to the magistrate, though a very
 wicked and unjust one for it is the rule of rules, the general law of
 laws, that every one observe those of the place wherein he lives.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["It is good to obey the laws of one's country."
 ?Excerpta ex Trag. Gyaecis, Grotio interp., 1626, p. 937.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And now to another point. It is a very great doubt, whether any so
 manifest benefit can accrue from the alteration of a law received, let it
 be what it will, as there is danger and inconvenience in altering it;
 forasmuch as government is a structure composed of divers parts and
 members joined and united together, with so strict connection, that it is
 impossible to stir so much as one brick or stone, but the whole body will
 be sensible of it. The legislator of the Thurians?[Charondas; Diod.
 Sic., xii. 24.]?ordained, that whosoever would go about either to
 abolish an old law, or to establish a new, should present himself with a
 halter about his neck to the people, to the end, that if the innovation he
 would introduce should not be approved by every one, he might immediately
 be hanged; and he of the Lacedaemonians employed his life to obtain from
 his citizens a faithful promise that none of his laws should be violated.?[Lycurgus;
 Plutarch, in Vita, c. 22.]?The Ephoros who so rudely cut the two
 strings that Phrynis had added to music never stood to examine whether
 that addition made better harmony, or that by its means the instrument was
 more full and complete; it was enough for him to condemn the invention,
 that it was a novelty, and an alteration of the old fashion. Which also is
 the meaning of the old rusty sword carried before the magistracy of
 Marseilles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For my own part, I have a great aversion from a novelty, what face or what
 pretence soever it may carry along with it, and have reason, having been
 an eyewitness of the great evils it has produced. For those which for so
 many years have lain so heavy upon us, it is not wholly accountable; but
 one may say, with colour enough, that it has accidentally produced and
 begotten the mischiefs and ruin that have since happened, both without and
 against it; it, principally, we are to accuse for these disorders:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Heu! patior telis vulnera facta meis."

 ["Alas! The wounds were made by my own weapons."
 ?Ovid, Ep. Phyll. Demophoonti, vers. 48.]
</pre>
 <p>
 They who give the first shock to a state, are almost naturally the first
 overwhelmed in its ruin the fruits of public commotion are seldom enjoyed
 by him who was the first motor; he beats and disturbs the water for
 another's net. The unity and contexture of this monarchy, of this grand
 edifice, having been ripped and torn in her old age, by this thing called
 innovation, has since laid open a rent, and given sufficient admittance to
 such injuries: the royal majesty with greater difficulty declines from the
 summit to the middle, then it falls and tumbles headlong from the middle
 to the bottom. But if the inventors do the greater mischief, the imitators
 are more vicious to follow examples of which they have felt and punished
 both the horror and the offence. And if there can be any degree of honour
 in ill-doing, these last must yield to the others the glory of contriving,
 and the courage of making the first attempt. All sorts of new disorders
 easily draw, from this primitive and ever-flowing fountain, examples and
 precedents to trouble and discompose our government: we read in our very
 laws, made for the remedy of this first evil, the beginning and pretences
 of all sorts of wicked enterprises; and that befalls us, which Thucydides
 said of the civil wars of his time, that, in favour of public vices, they
 gave them new and more plausible names for their excuse, sweetening and
 disguising their true titles; which must be done, forsooth, to reform our
 conscience and belief:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Honesta oratio est;"

 ["Fine words truly."?Ter. And., i. I, 114.]
</pre>
 <p>
 but the best pretence for innovation is of very dangerous consequence:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aden nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est."

 ["We are ever wrong in changing ancient ways."?Livy, xxxiv. 54]
</pre>
 <p>
 And freely to speak my thoughts, it argues a strange self-love and great
 presumption to be so fond of one's own opinions, that a public peace must
 be overthrown to establish them, and to introduce so many inevitable
 mischiefs, and so dreadful a corruption of manners, as a civil war and the
 mutations of state consequent to it, always bring in their train, and to
 introduce them, in a thing of so high concern, into the bowels of one's
 own country. Can there be worse husbandry than to set up so many certain
 and knowing vices against errors that are only contested and disputable?
 And are there any worse sorts of vices than those committed against a
 man's own conscience, and the natural light of his own reason? The Senate,
 upon the dispute betwixt it and the people about the administration of
 their religion, was bold enough to return this evasion for current pay:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ad deos id magis, quam ad se, pertinere: ipsos visuros,
 ne sacra sua polluantur;"

 ["Those things belong to the gods to determine than to them; let the
 gods, therefore, take care that their sacred mysteries were not
 profaned."?Livy, x. 6.]
</pre>
 <p>
 according to what the oracle answered to those of Delphos who, fearing to
 be invaded by the Persians in the Median war, inquired of Apollo, how they
 should dispose of the holy treasure of his temple; whether they should
 hide, or remove it to some other place? He returned them answer, that they
 should stir nothing from thence, and only take care of themselves, for he
 was sufficient to look to what belonged to him. ?[Herodotus, viii.
 36.].?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Christian religion has all the marks of the utmost utility and
 justice: but none more manifest than the severe injunction it lays
 indifferently upon all to yield absolute obedience to the civil
 magistrate, and to maintain and defend the laws. Of which, what a
 wonderful example has the divine wisdom left us, that, to establish the
 salvation of mankind, and to conduct His glorious victory over death and
 sin, would do it after no other way, but at the mercy of our ordinary
 forms of justice subjecting the progress and issue of so high and so
 salutiferous an effect, to the blindness and injustice of our customs and
 observances; sacrificing the innocent blood of so many of His elect, and
 so long a loss of so many years, to the maturing of this inestimable
 fruit? There is a vast difference betwixt the case of one who follows the
 forms and laws of his country, and of another who will undertake to
 regulate and change them; of whom the first pleads simplicity, obedience,
 and example for his excuse, who, whatever he shall do, it cannot be
 imputed to malice; 'tis at the worst but misfortune:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quis est enim, quem non moveat clarissimis monumentis
 testata consignataque antiquitas?"

 ["For who is there that antiquity, attested and confirmed by the
 fairest monuments, cannot move?"?Cicero, De Divin., i. 40.]
</pre>
 <p>
 besides what Isocrates says, that defect is nearer allied to moderation
 than excess: the other is a much more ruffling gamester; for whosoever
 shall take upon him to choose and alter, usurps the authority of judging,
 and should look well about him, and make it his business to discern
 clearly the defect of what he would abolish, and the virtue of what he is
 about to introduce.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This so vulgar consideration is that which settled me in my station, and
 kept even my most extravagant and ungoverned youth under the rein, so as
 not to burden my shoulders with so great a weight, as to render myself
 responsible for a science of that importance, and in this to dare, what in
 my better and more mature judgment, I durst not do in the most easy and
 indifferent things I had been instructed in, and wherein the temerity of
 judging is of no consequence at all; it seeming to me very unjust to go
 about to subject public and established customs and institutions, to the
 weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy (for private
 reason has but a private jurisdiction), and to attempt that upon the
 divine, which no government will endure a man should do, upon the civil
 laws; with which, though human reason has much more commerce than with the
 other, yet are they sovereignly judged by their own proper judges, and the
 extreme sufficiency serves only to expound and set forth the law and
 custom received, and neither to wrest it, nor to introduce anything, of
 innovation. If, sometimes, the divine providence has gone beyond the rules
 to which it has necessarily bound and obliged us men, it is not to give us
 any dispensation to do the same; those are masterstrokes of the divine
 hand, which we are not to imitate, but to admire, and extraordinary
 examples, marks of express and particular purposes, of the nature of
 miracles, presented before us for manifestations of its almightiness,
 equally above both our rules and force, which it would be folly and
 impiety to attempt to represent and imitate; and that we ought not to
 follow, but to contemplate with the greatest reverence: acts of His
 personage, and not for us. Cotta very opportunely declares:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quum de religione agitur, Ti. Coruncanium, P. Scipionem,
 P. Scaevolam, pontifices maximos, non Zenonem, aut Cleanthem,
 aut Chrysippum, sequor."

 ["When matter of religion is in question, I follow the high priests
 T. Coruncanius, P. Scipio, P. Scaevola, and not Zeno, Cleanthes, or
 Chrysippus."?Cicero, De Natura Deor., iii. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 God knows, in the present quarrel of our civil war, where there are a
 hundred articles to dash out and to put in, great and very considerable,
 how many there are who can truly boast, they have exactly and perfectly
 weighed and understood the grounds and reasons of the one and the other
 party; 'tis a number, if they make any number, that would be able to give
 us very little disturbance. But what becomes of all the rest, under what
 ensigns do they march, in what quarter do they lie? Theirs have the same
 effect with other weak and ill-applied medicines; they have only set the
 humours they would purge more violently in work, stirred and exasperated
 by the conflict, and left them still behind. The potion was too weak to
 purge, but strong enough to weaken us; so that it does not work, but we
 keep it still in our bodies, and reap nothing from the operation but
 intestine gripes and dolours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So it is, nevertheless, that Fortune still reserving her authority in
 defiance of whatever we are able to do or say, sometimes presents us with
 a necessity so urgent, that 'tis requisite the laws should a little yield
 and give way; and when one opposes the increase of an innovation that thus
 intrudes itself by violence, to keep a man's self in so doing, in all
 places and in all things within bounds and rules against those who have
 the power, and to whom all things are lawful that may in any way serve to
 advance their design, who have no other law nor rule but what serves best
 to their own purpose, 'tis a dangerous obligation and an intolerable
 inequality:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aditum nocendi perfido praestat fides,"

 ["Putting faith in a treacherous person, opens the door to
 harm."?Seneca, OEdip., act iii., verse 686.]
</pre>
 <p>
 forasmuch as the ordinary discipline of a healthful state does not provide
 against these extraordinary accidents; it presupposes a body that supports
 itself in its principal members and offices, and a common consent to its
 obedience and observation. A legitimate proceeding is cold, heavy, and
 constrained, and not fit to make head against a headstrong and unbridled
 proceeding. 'Tis known to be to this day cast in the dish of those two
 great men, Octavius and Cato, in the two civil wars of Sylla and Caesar,
 that they would rather suffer their country to undergo the last
 extremities, than relieve their fellow-citizens at the expense of its
 laws, or be guilty of any innovation; for in truth, in these last
 necessities, where there is no other remedy, it would, peradventure, be
 more discreetly done, to stoop and yield a little to receive the blow,
 than, by opposing without possibility of doing good, to give occasion to
 violence to trample all under foot; and better to make the laws do what
 they can, when they cannot do what they would. After this manner did he?[Agesilaus.]?who
 suspended them for four-and-twenty hours, and he who, for once shifted a
 day in the calendar, and that other?[Alexander the Great.]?who
 of the month of June made a second of May. The Lacedaemonians themselves,
 who were so religious observers of the laws of their country, being
 straitened by one of their own edicts, by which it was expressly forbidden
 to choose the same man twice to be admiral; and on the other side, their
 affairs necessarily requiring, that Lysander should again take upon him
 that command, they made one Aratus admiral; 'tis true, but withal,
 Lysander went general of the navy; and, by the same subtlety, one of their
 ambassadors being sent to the Athenians to obtain the revocation of some
 decree, and Pericles remonstrating to him, that it was forbidden to take
 away the tablet wherein a law had once been engrossed, he advised him to
 turn it only, that being not forbidden; and Plutarch commends Philopoemen,
 that being born to command, he knew how to do it, not only according to
 the laws, but also to overrule even the laws themselves, when the public
 necessity so required.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIII??VARIOUS EVENTS FROM THE SAME COUNSEL
 </h2>
 <p>
 Jacques Amiot, grand almoner of France, one day related to me this story,
 much to the honour of a prince of ours (and ours he was upon several very
 good accounts, though originally of foreign extraction),?[The Duc de
 Guise, surnamed Le Balafre.]?that in the time of our first
 commotions, at the siege of Rouen,?[In 1562]?this prince,
 having been advertised by the queen-mother of a conspiracy against his
 life, and in her letters particular notice being given him of the person
 who was to execute the business (who was a gentleman of Anjou or of Maine,
 and who to this effect ordinarily frequented this prince's house),
 discovered not a syllable of this intelligence to any one whatever; but
 going the next day to the St. Catherine's Mount,?[An eminence
 outside Rouen overlooking the Seine. D.W.]?from which our battery
 played against the town (for it was during the time of the siege), and
 having in company with him the said lord almoner, and another bishop, he
 saw this gentleman, who had been denoted to him, and presently sent for
 him; to whom, being come before him, seeing him already pale and trembling
 with the conscience of his guilt, he thus said, "Monsieur," such an one,
 "you guess what I have to say to you; your countenance discovers it; 'tis
 in vain to disguise your practice, for I am so well informed of your
 business, that it will but make worse for you, to go about to conceal or
 deny it: you know very well such and such passages" (which were the most
 secret circumstances of his conspiracy), "and therefore be sure, as you
 tender your own life, to confess to me the whole truth of the design." The
 poor man seeing himself thus trapped and convicted (for the whole business
 had been discovered to the queen by one of the accomplices), was in such a
 taking, he knew not what to do; but, folding his hands, to beg and sue for
 mercy, he threw himself at his prince's feet, who taking him up, proceeded
 to say, "Come, sir; tell me, have I at any time done you offence? or have
 I, through private hatred or malice, offended any kinsman or friend of
 yours? It is not above three weeks that I have known you; what inducement,
 then, could move you to attempt my death?" To which the gentleman with a
 trembling voice replied, "That it was no particular grudge he had to his
 person, but the general interest and concern of his party, and that he had
 been put upon it by some who had persuaded him it would be a meritorious
 act, by any means, to extirpate so great and so powerful an enemy of their
 religion." "Well," said the prince, "I will now let you see, how much more
 charitable the religion is that I maintain, than that which you profess:
 yours has counselled you to kill me, without hearing me speak, and without
 ever having given you any cause of offence; and mine commands me to
 forgive you, convict as you are, by your own confession, of a design to
 kill me without reason.?[Imitated by Voltaire. See Nodier,
 Questions, p. 165.]?Get you gone; let me see you no more; and, if
 you are wise, choose henceforward honester men for your counsellors in
 your designs."?[Dampmartin, La Fortune de la Coup, liv. ii., p. 139]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Emperor Augustus,?[This story is taken from Seneca, De
 Clementia, i. 9.]?being in Gaul, had certain information of a
 conspiracy L. Cinna was contriving against him; he therefore resolved to
 make him an example; and, to that end, sent to summon his friends to meet
 the next morning in counsel. But the night between he passed in great
 unquietness of mind, considering that he was about to put to death a young
 man, of an illustrious family, and nephew to the great Pompey, and this
 made him break out into several passionate complainings. "What then," said
 he, "is it possible that I am to live in perpetual anxiety and alarm, and
 suffer my would-be assassin, meantime, to walk abroad at liberty? Shall he
 go unpunished, after having conspired against my life, a life that I have
 hitherto defended in so many civil wars, in so many battles by land and by
 sea? And after having settled the universal peace of the whole world,
 shall this man be pardoned, who has conspired not only to murder, but to
 sacrifice me?"?for the conspiracy was to kill him at sacrifice.
 After which, remaining for some time silent, he began again, in louder
 tones, and exclaimed against himself, saying: "Why livest thou, if it be
 for the good of so many that thou shouldst die? must there be no end of
 thy revenges and cruelties? Is thy life of so great value, that so many
 mischiefs must be done to preserve it?" His wife Livia, seeing him in this
 perplexity: "Will you take a woman's counsel?" said she. "Do as the
 physicians do, who, when the ordinary recipes will do no good, make trial
 of the contrary. By severity you have hitherto prevailed nothing; Lepidus
 has followed Salvidienus; Murena, Lepidus; Caepio, Murena; Egnatius,
 Caepio. Begin now, and try how sweetness and clemency will succeed. Cinna
 is convict; forgive him, he will never henceforth have the heart to hurt
 thee, and it will be an act to thy glory." Augustus was well pleased that
 he had met with an advocate of his own humour; wherefore, having thanked
 his wife, and, in the morning, countermanded his friends he had before
 summoned to council, he commanded Cinna all alone to be brought to him;
 who being accordingly come, and a chair by his appointment set him, having
 ordered all the rest out of the room, he spake to him after this manner:
 "In the first place, Cinna, I demand of thee patient audience; do not
 interrupt me in what I am about to say, and I will afterwards give thee
 time and leisure to answer. Thou knowest, Cinna,?[This passage,
 borrowed from Seneca, has been paraphrased in verse by Corneille. See
 Nodier, Questions de la Literature llgale, 1828, pp. 7, 160. The monologue
 of Augustus in this chapter is also from Seneca. Ibid., 164.]?that
 having taken thee prisoner in the enemy's camp, and thou an enemy, not
 only so become, but born so, I gave thee thy life, restored to thee all
 thy goods, and, finally, put thee in so good a posture, by my bounty, of
 living well and at thy ease, that the victorious envied the conquered. The
 sacerdotal office which thou madest suit to me for, I conferred upon thee,
 after having denied it to others, whose fathers have ever borne arms in my
 service. After so many obligations, thou hast undertaken to kill me." At
 which Cinna crying out that he was very far from entertaining any so
 wicked a thought: "Thou dost not keep thy promise, Cinna," continued
 Augustus, "that thou wouldst not interrupt me. Yes, thou hast undertaken
 to murder me in such a place, on such a day, in such and such company, and
 in such a manner." At which words, seeing Cinna astounded and silent, not
 upon the account of his promise so to be, but interdict with the weight of
 his conscience: "Why," proceeded Augustus, "to what end wouldst thou do
 it? Is it to be emperor? Believe me, the Republic is in very ill
 condition, if I am the only man betwixt thee and the empire. Thou art not
 able so much as to defend thy own house, and but t'other day was baffled
 in a suit, by the opposed interest of a mere manumitted slave. What, hast
 thou neither means nor power in any other thing, but only to undertake
 Caesar? I quit the throne, if there be no other than I to obstruct thy
 hopes. Canst thou believe that Paulus, that Fabius, that the Cossii and
 the Servilii, and so many noble Romans, not only so in title, but who by
 their virtue honour their nobility, would suffer or endure thee?" After
 this, and a great deal more that he said to him (for he was two long hours
 in speaking), "Now go, Cinna, go thy way: I give thee that life as traitor
 and parricide, which I before gave thee in the quality of an enemy. Let
 friendship from this time forward begin betwixt us, and let us show
 whether I have given, or thou hast received thy life with the better
 faith"; and so departed from him. Some time after, he preferred him to the
 consular dignity, complaining that he had not the confidence to demand it;
 had him ever after for his very great friend, and was, at last, made by
 him sole heir to all his estate. Now, from the time of this accident which
 befell Augustus in the fortieth year of his age, he never had any
 conspiracy or attempt against him, and so reaped the due reward of this
 his so generous clemency. But it did not so happen with our prince, his
 moderation and mercy not so securing him, but that he afterwards fell into
 the toils of the like treason,?[The Duc de Guise was assassinated in
 1563 by Poltrot.]?so vain and futile a thing is human prudence;
 throughout all our projects, counsels and precautions, Fortune will still
 be mistress of events.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We repute physicians fortunate when they hit upon a lucky cure, as if
 there was no other art but theirs that could not stand upon its own legs,
 and whose foundations are too weak to support itself upon its own basis;
 as if no other art stood in need of Fortune's hand to help it. For my
 part, I think of physic as much good or ill as any one would have me: for,
 thanks be to God, we have no traffic together. I am of a quite contrary
 humour to other men, for I always despise it; but when I am sick, instead
 of recanting, or entering into composition with it, I begin, moreover, to
 hate and fear it, telling them who importune me to take physic, that at
 all events they must give me time to recover my strength and health, that
 I may be the better able to support and encounter the violence and danger
 of their potions. I let nature work, supposing her to be sufficiently
 armed with teeth and claws to defend herself from the assaults of
 infirmity, and to uphold that contexture, the dissolution of which she
 flies and abhors. I am afraid, lest, instead of assisting her when close
 grappled and struggling with disease, I should assist her adversary, and
 burden her still more with work to do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, I say, that not in physic only, but in other more certain arts,
 fortune has a very great part.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poetic raptures, the flights of fancy, that ravish and transport the
 author out of himself, why should we not attribute them to his good
 fortune, since he himself confesses that they exceed his sufficiency and
 force, and acknowledges them to proceed from something else than himself,
 and that he has them no more in his power than the orators say they have
 those extraordinary motions and agitations that sometimes push them beyond
 their design. It is the same in painting, where touches shall sometimes
 slip from the hand of the painter, so surpassing both his conception and
 his art, as to beget his own admiration and astonishment. But Fortune does
 yet more evidently manifest the share she has in all things of this kind,
 by the graces and elegances we find in them, not only beyond the
 intention, but even without the knowledge of the workman: a competent
 reader often discovers in other men's writings other perfections than the
 author himself either intended or perceived, a richer sense and more
 quaint expression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As to military enterprises, every one sees how great a hand Fortune has in
 them. Even in our counsels and deliberations there must, certainly, be
 something of chance and good-luck mixed with human prudence; for all that
 our wisdom can do alone is no great matter; the more piercing, quick, and
 apprehensive it is, the weaker it finds itself, and is by so much more apt
 to mistrust itself. I am of Sylla's opinion;?["Who freed his great
 deeds from envy by ever attributing them to his good fortune, and finally
 by surnaming himself Faustus, the Lucky."?Plutarch, How far a Man
 may praise Himself, c. 9.]?and when I closely examine the most
 glorious exploits of war, I perceive, methinks, that those who carry them
 on make use of counsel and debate only for custom's sake, and leave the
 best part of the enterprise to Fortune, and relying upon her aid,
 transgress, at every turn, the bounds of military conduct and the rules of
 war. There happen, sometimes, fortuitous alacrities and strange furies in
 their deliberations, that for the most part prompt them to follow the
 worst grounded counsels, and swell their courage beyond the limits of
 reason. Whence it happened that several of the great captains of old, to
 justify those rash resolutions, have been fain to tell their soldiers that
 they were invited to such attempts by some inspiration, some sign and
 prognostic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Wherefore, in this doubt and uncertainty, that the shortsightedness of
 human wisdom to see and choose the best (by reason of the difficulties
 that the various accidents and circumstances of things bring along with
 them) perplexes us withal, the surest way, in my opinion, did no other
 consideration invite us to it, is to pitch upon that wherein is the
 greatest appearance of honesty and justice; and not, being certain of the
 shortest, to keep the straightest and most direct way; as in the two
 examples I have just given, there is no question but it was more noble and
 generous in him who had received the offence, to pardon it, than to do
 otherwise. If the former?[The Duc de Guise.]?miscarried in it,
 he is not, nevertheless, to be blamed for his good intention; neither does
 any one know if he had proceeded otherwise, whether by that means he had
 avoided the end his destiny had appointed for him; and he had, moreover,
 lost the glory of so humane an act.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 You will read in history, of many who have been in such apprehension, that
 the most part have taken the course to meet and anticipate conspiracies
 against them by punishment and revenge; but I find very few who have
 reaped any advantage by this proceeding; witness so many Roman emperors.
 Whoever finds himself in this danger, ought not to expect much either from
 his vigilance or power; for how hard a thing is it for a man to secure
 himself from an enemy, who lies concealed under the countenance of the
 most assiduous friend we have, and to discover and know the wills and
 inward thoughts of those who are in our personal service. 'Tis to much
 purpose to have a guard of foreigners about one, and to be always fenced
 about with a pale of armed men; whosoever despises his own life, is always
 master of that of another man.?[Seneca, Ep., 4.]?And moreover,
 this continual suspicion, that makes a prince jealous of all the world,
 must of necessity be a strange torment to him. Therefore it was, that
 Dion, being advertised that Callippus watched all opportunities to take
 away his life, had never the heart to inquire more particularly into it,
 saying, that he had rather die than live in that misery, that he must
 continually stand upon his guard, not only against his enemies, but his
 friends also;?[Plutarch, Apothegms.]?which Alexander much more
 vividly and more roundly manifested in effect, when, having notice by a
 letter from Parmenio, that Philip, his most beloved physician, was by
 Darius' money corrupted to poison him, at the same time he gave the letter
 to Philip to read, drank off the potion he had brought him. Was not this
 to express a resolution, that if his friends had a mind to despatch him
 out of the world, he was willing to give them opportunity to do it? This
 prince is, indeed, the sovereign pattern of hazardous actions; but I do
 not know whether there be another passage in his life wherein there is so
 much firm courage as in this, nor so illustrious an image of the beauty
 and greatness of his mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those who preach to princes so circumspect and vigilant a jealousy and
 distrust, under colour of security, preach to them ruin and dishonour:
 nothing noble can be performed without danger. I know a person, naturally
 of a very great daring and enterprising courage, whose good fortune is
 continually marred by such persuasions, that he keep himself close
 surrounded by his friends, that he must not hearken to any reconciliation
 with his ancient enemies, that he must stand aloof, and not trust his
 person in hands stronger than his own, what promises or offers soever they
 may make him, or what advantages soever he may see before him. And I know
 another, who has unexpectedly advanced his fortunes by following a clear
 contrary advice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Courage, the reputation and glory of which men seek with so greedy an
 appetite, presents itself, when need requires, as magnificently in cuerpo,
 as in full armour; in a closet, as in a camp; with arms pendant, as with
 arms raised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This over-circumspect and wary prudence is a mortal enemy to all high and
 generous exploits. Scipio, to sound Syphax's intention, leaving his army,
 abandoning Spain, not yet secure nor well settled in his new conquest,
 could pass over into Africa in two small ships, to commit himself, in an
 enemy's country, to the power of a barbarian king, to a faith untried and
 unknown, without obligation, without hostage, under the sole security of
 the grandeur of his own courage, his good fortune, and the promise of his
 high hopes.?[ Livy, xxviii. 17.]
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Habita fides ipsam plerumque fidem obligat."

 ["Trust often obliges fidelity."?Livy, xxii. 22.]
</pre>
 <p>
 In a life of ambition and glory, it is necessary to hold a stiff rein upon
 suspicion: fear and distrust invite and draw on offence. The most
 mistrustful of our kings?[ Louis XI.]?established his affairs
 principally by voluntarily committing his life and liberty into his
 enemies' hands, by that action manifesting that he had absolute confidence
 in them, to the end they might repose as great an assurance in him. Caesar
 only opposed the authority of his countenance and the haughty sharpness of
 his rebukes to his mutinous legions in arms against him:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Stetit aggere fulti
 Cespitis, intrepidus vultu: meruitque timeri,
 Nil metuens."

 ["He stood on a mound, his countenance intrepid, and merited to be
 feared, he fearing nothing."?Lucan, v. 316.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But it is true, withal, that this undaunted assurance is not to be
 represented in its simple and entire form, but by such whom the
 apprehension of death, and the worst that can happen, does not terrify and
 affright; for to represent a pretended resolution with a pale and doubtful
 countenance and trembling limbs, for the service of an important
 reconciliation, will effect nothing to purpose. 'Tis an excellent way to
 gain the heart and will of another, to submit and intrust one's self to
 him, provided it appear to be freely done, and without the constraint of
 necessity, and in such a condition, that a man manifestly does it out of a
 pure and entire confidence in the party, at least, with a countenance
 clear from any cloud of suspicion. I saw, when I was a boy, a gentleman,
 who was governor of a great city, upon occasion of a popular commotion and
 fury, not knowing what other course to take, go out of a place of very
 great strength and security, and commit himself to the mercy of the
 seditious rabble, in hopes by that means to appease the tumult before it
 grew to a more formidable head; but it was ill for him that he did so, for
 he was there miserably slain. But I am not, nevertheless, of opinion, that
 he committed so great an error in going out, as men commonly reproach his
 memory withal, as he did in choosing a gentle and submissive way for the
 effecting his purpose, and in endeavouring to quiet this storm, rather by
 obeying than commanding, and by entreaty rather than remonstrance; and I
 am inclined to believe, that a gracious severity, with a soldierlike way
 of commanding, full of security and confidence, suitable to the quality of
 his person, and the dignity of his command, would have succeeded better
 with him; at least, he had perished with greater decency and, reputation.
 There is nothing so little to be expected or hoped for from this
 many-headed monster, in its fury, as humanity and good nature; it is much
 more capable of reverence and fear. I should also reproach him, that
 having taken a resolution (in my judgment rather brave than rash) to
 expose himself, weak and naked, in this tempestuous sea of enraged madmen,
 he ought to have stuck to his text, and not for an instant to have
 abandoned the high part he had undertaken; whereas, coming to discover his
 danger nearer hand, and his nose happening to bleed, he again changed that
 demiss and fawning countenance he had at first put on, into another of
 fear and amazement, filling his voice with entreaties and his eyes with
 tears, and, endeavouring so to withdraw and secure his person, that
 carriage more inflamed their fury, and soon brought the effects of it upon
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was upon a time intended that there should be a general muster of
 several troops in arms (and that is the most proper occasion of secret
 revenges, and there is no place where they can be executed with greater
 safety), and there were public and manifest appearances, that there was no
 safe coming for some, whose principal and necessary office it was to
 review them. Whereupon a consultation was held, and several counsels were
 proposed, as in a case that was very nice and of great difficulty; and
 moreover of grave consequence. Mine, amongst the rest, was, that they
 should by all means avoid giving any sign of suspicion, but that the
 officers who were most in danger should boldly go, and with cheerful and
 erect countenances ride boldly and confidently through the ranks, and that
 instead of sparing fire (which the counsels of the major part tended to)
 they should entreat the captains to command the soldiers to give round and
 full volleys in honour of the spectators, and not to spare their powder.
 This was accordingly done, and served so good use, as to please and
 gratify the suspected troops, and thenceforward to beget a mutual and
 wholesome confidence and intelligence amongst them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I look upon Julius Caesar's way of winning men to him as the best and
 finest that can be put in practice. First, he tried by clemency to make
 himself beloved even by his very enemies, contenting himself, in detected
 conspiracies, only publicly to declare, that he was pre-acquainted with
 them; which being done, he took a noble resolution to await without
 solicitude or fear, whatever might be the event, wholly resigning himself
 to the protection of the gods and fortune: for, questionless, in this
 state he was at the time when he was killed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A stranger having publicly said, that he could teach Dionysius, the tyrant
 of Syracuse, an infallible way to find out and discover all the
 conspiracies his subjects could contrive against him, if he would give him
 a good sum of money for his pains, Dionysius hearing of it, caused the man
 to be brought to him, that he might learn an art so necessary to his
 preservation. The man made answer, that all the art he knew, was, that he
 should give him a talent, and afterwards boast that he had obtained a
 singular secret from him. Dionysius liked the invention, and accordingly
 caused six hundred crowns to be counted out to him. ?[Plutarch,
 Apothegms.]?It was not likely he should give so great a sum to a
 person unknown, but upon the account of some extraordinary discovery, and
 the belief of this served to keep his enemies in awe. Princes, however, do
 wisely to publish the informations they receive of all the practices
 against their lives, to possess men with an opinion they have so good
 intelligence that nothing can be plotted against them, but they have
 present notice of it. The Duke of Athens did a great many foolish things
 in the establishment of his new tyranny over Florence: but this especially
 was most notable, that having received the first intimation of the
 conspiracies the people were hatching against him, from Matteo di Morozzo,
 one of the conspirators, he presently put him to death, to suppress that
 rumour, that it might not be thought any of the city disliked his
 government.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I remember I have formerly read a story?[In Appian's Civil Wars,
 book iv..]?of some Roman of great quality who, flying the tyranny of
 the Triumvirate, had a thousand times by the subtlety of as many
 inventions escaped from falling into the hands of those that pursued him.
 It happened one day that a troop of horse, which was sent out to take him,
 passed close by a brake where he was squat, and missed very narrowly of
 spying him: but he considering, at this point, the pains and difficulties
 wherein he had so long continued to evade the strict and incessant
 searches that were every day made for him, the little pleasure he could
 hope for in such a kind of life, and how much better it was for him to die
 once for all, than to be perpetually at this pass, he started from his
 seat, called them back, showed them his form,?[as of a squatting
 hare.]?and voluntarily delivered himself up to their cruelty, by
 that means to free both himself and them from further trouble. To invite a
 man's enemies to come and cut his throat, seems a resolution a little
 extravagant and odd; and yet I think he did better to take that course,
 than to live in continual feverish fear of an accident for which there was
 no cure. But seeing all the remedies a man can apply to such a disease,
 are full of unquietness and uncertainty, 'tis better with a manly courage
 to prepare one's self for the worst that can happen, and to extract some
 consolation from this, that we are not certain the thing we fear will ever
 come to pass.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIV??OF PEDANTRY
 </h2>
 <p>
 I was often, when a boy, wonderfully concerned to see, in the Italian
 farces, a pedant always brought in for the fool of the play, and that the
 title of Magister was in no greater reverence amongst us: for being
 delivered up to their tuition, what could I do less than be jealous of
 their honour and reputation? I sought indeed to excuse them by the natural
 incompatibility betwixt the vulgar sort and men of a finer thread, both in
 judgment and knowledge, forasmuch as they go a quite contrary way to one
 another: but in this, the thing I most stumbled at was, that the finest
 gentlemen were those who most despised them; witness our famous poet Du
 Bellay?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Mais je hay par sur tout un scavoir pedantesque."

 ["Of all things I hate pedantic learning."?Du Bellay]
</pre>
 <p>
 And 'twas so in former times; for Plutarch says that Greek and Scholar
 were terms of reproach and contempt amongst the Romans. But since, with
 the better experience of age, I find they had very great reason so to do,
 and that?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Magis magnos clericos non sunt magis magnos sapientes."

 ["The greatest clerks are not the wisest men." A proverb given in
 Rabelais' Gargantua, i. 39.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But whence it should come to pass, that a mind enriched with the knowledge
 of so many things should not become more quick and sprightly, and that a
 gross and vulgar understanding should lodge within it, without correcting
 and improving itself, all the discourses and judgments of the greatest
 minds the world ever had, I am yet to seek. To admit so many foreign
 conceptions, so great, and so high fancies, it is necessary (as a young
 lady, one of the greatest princesses of the kingdom, said to me once,
 speaking of a certain person) that a man's own brain must be crowded and
 squeezed together into a less compass, to make room for the others; I
 should be apt to conclude, that as plants are suffocated and drowned with
 too much nourishment, and lamps with too much oil, so with too much study
 and matter is the active part of the understanding which, being
 embarrassed, and confounded with a great diversity of things, loses the
 force and power to disengage itself, and by the pressure of this weight,
 is bowed, subjected, and doubled up. But it is quite otherwise; for our
 soul stretches and dilates itself proportionably as it fills; and in the
 examples of elder times, we see, quite contrary, men very proper for
 public business, great captains, and great statesmen very learned withal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, as to the philosophers, a sort of men remote from all public affairs,
 they have been sometimes also despised by the comic liberty of their
 times; their opinions and manners making them appear, to men of another
 sort, ridiculous. Would you make them judges of a lawsuit, of the actions
 of men? they are ready to take it upon them, and straight begin to examine
 if there be life, if there be motion, if man be any other than an ox;?["If
 Montaigne has copied all this from Plato's Theatetes, p.127, F. as it is
 plain by all which he has added immediately after, that he has taken it
 from that dialogue, he has grossly mistaken Plato's sentiment, who says
 here no more than this, that the philosopher is so ignorant of what his
 neighbour does, that he scarce knows whether he is a man, or some other
 animal:?Coste."]?what it is to do and to suffer? what animals
 law and justice are? Do they speak of the magistrates, or to him, 'tis
 with a rude, irreverent, and indecent liberty. Do they hear their prince,
 or a king commended? they make no more of him, than of a shepherd,
 goatherd, or neatherd: a lazy Coridon, occupied in milking and shearing
 his herds and flocks, but more rudely and harshly than the herd or
 shepherd himself. Do you repute any man the greater for being lord of two
 thousand acres of land? they laugh at such a pitiful pittance, as laying
 claim themselves to the whole world for their possession. Do you boast of
 your nobility, as being descended from seven rich successive ancestors?
 they look upon you with an eye of contempt, as men who have not a right
 idea of the universal image of nature, and that do not consider how many
 predecessors every one of us has had, rich, poor, kings, slaves, Greeks,
 and barbarians; and though you were the fiftieth descendant from Hercules,
 they look upon it as a great vanity, so highly to value this, which is
 only a gift of fortune. And 'twas so the vulgar sort contemned them, as
 men ignorant of the most elementary and ordinary things; as presumptuous
 and insolent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But this Platonic picture is far different from that these pedants are
 presented by. Those were envied for raising themselves above the common
 sort, for despising the ordinary actions and offices of life, for having
 assumed a particular and inimitable way of living, and for using a certain
 method of high-flight and obsolete language, quite different from the
 ordinary way of speaking: but these are contemned as being as much below
 the usual form, as incapable of public employment, as leading a life and
 conforming themselves to the mean and vile manners of the vulgar:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Odi ignava opera, philosopha sententia."

 ["I hate men who jabber about philosophy, but do nothing."
 ?Pacuvius, ap Gellium, xiii. 8.]
</pre>
 <p>
 For what concerns the philosophers, as I have said, if they were in
 science, they were yet much greater in action. And, as it is said of the
 geometrician of Syracuse,?[Archimedes.]?who having been
 disturbed from his contemplation, to put some of his skill in practice for
 the defence of his country, that he suddenly set on foot dreadful and
 prodigious engines, that wrought effects beyond all human expectation;
 himself, notwithstanding, disdaining all his handiwork, and thinking in
 this he had played the mere mechanic, and violated the dignity of his art,
 of which these performances of his he accounted but trivial experiments
 and playthings so they, whenever they have been put upon the proof of
 action, have been seen to fly to so high a pitch, as made it very well
 appear, their souls were marvellously elevated, and enriched by the
 knowledge of things. But some of them, seeing the reins of government in
 the hands of incapable men, have avoided all management of political
 affairs; and he who demanded of Crates, how long it was necessary to
 philosophise, received this answer: "Till our armies are no more commanded
 by fools." ?[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 92.]?Heraclitus resigned
 the royalty to his brother; and, to the Ephesians, who reproached him that
 he spent his time in playing with children before the temple: "Is it not
 better," said he, "to do so, than to sit at the helm of affairs in your
 company?" Others having their imagination advanced above the world and
 fortune, have looked upon the tribunals of justice, and even the thrones
 of kings, as paltry and contemptible; insomuch, that Empedocles refused
 the royalty that the Agrigentines offered to him. Thales, once inveighing
 in discourse against the pains and care men put themselves to to become
 rich, was answered by one in the company, that he did like the fox, who
 found fault with what he could not obtain. Whereupon, he had a mind, for
 the jest's sake, to show them to the contrary; and having, for this
 occasion, made a muster of all his wits, wholly to employ them in the
 service of profit and gain, he set a traffic on foot, which in one year
 brought him in so great riches, that the most experienced in that trade
 could hardly in their whole lives, with all their industry, have raked so
 much together.?[Diogenes Laertius, Life of Thales, i. 26; Cicero, De
 Divin., i. 49.]?That which Aristotle reports of some who called both
 him and Anaxagoras, and others of their profession, wise but not prudent,
 in not applying their study to more profitable things?though I do
 not well digest this verbal distinction?that will not, however,
 serve to excuse my pedants, for to see the low and necessitous fortune
 wherewith they are content, we have rather reason to pronounce that they
 are neither wise nor prudent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But letting this first reason alone, I think it better to say, that this
 evil proceeds from their applying themselves the wrong way to the study of
 the sciences; and that, after the manner we are instructed, it is no
 wonder if neither the scholars nor the masters become, though more
 learned, ever the wiser, or more able. In plain truth, the cares and
 expense our parents are at in our education, point at nothing, but to
 furnish our heads with knowledge; but not a word of judgment and virtue.
 Cry out, of one that passes by, to the people: "O, what a learned man!"
 and of another, "O, what a good man!"?[Translated from Seneca, Ep.,
 88.]?they will not fail to turn their eyes, and address their
 respect to the former. There should then be a third crier, "O, the
 blockheads!" Men are apt presently to inquire, does such a one understand
 Greek or Latin? Is he a poet? or does he write in prose? But whether he be
 grown better or more discreet, which are qualities of principal concern,
 these are never thought of. We should rather examine, who is better
 learned, than who is more learned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We only labour to stuff the memory, and leave the conscience and the
 understanding unfurnished and void. Like birds who fly abroad to forage
 for grain, and bring it home in the beak, without tasting it themselves,
 to feed their young; so our pedants go picking knowledge here and there,
 out of books, and hold it at the tongue's end, only to spit it out and
 distribute it abroad. And here I cannot but smile to think how I have paid
 myself in showing the foppery of this kind of learning, who myself am so
 manifest an example; for, do I not the same thing throughout almost this
 whole composition? I go here and there, culling out of several books the
 sentences that best please me, not to keep them (for I have no memory to
 retain them in), but to transplant them into this; where, to say the
 truth, they are no more mine than in their first places. We are, I
 conceive, knowing only in present knowledge, and not at all in what is
 past, or more than is that which is to come. But the worst on't is, their
 scholars and pupils are no better nourished by this kind of inspiration;
 and it makes no deeper impression upon them, but passes from hand to hand,
 only to make a show to be tolerable company, and to tell pretty stories,
 like a counterfeit coin in counters, of no other use or value, but to
 reckon with, or to set up at cards:

 We can say, Cicero says thus; these were the manners of Plato; these are

 And this puts me in mind of that rich gentleman of Rome,?[Calvisius
 Sabinus. Seneca, Ep., 27.]?who had been solicitous, with very great
 expense, to procure men that were excellent in all sorts of science, whom
 he had always attending his person, to the end, that when amongst his
 friends any occasion fell out of speaking of any subject whatsoever, they
 might supply his place, and be ready to prompt him, one with a sentence of
 Seneca, another with a verse of Homer, and so forth, every one according
 to his talent; and he fancied this knowledge to be his own, because it was
 in the heads of those who lived upon his bounty; as they also do, whose
 learning consists in having noble libraries. I know one, who, when I
 question him what he knows, he presently calls for a book to shew me, and
 dares not venture to tell me so much, as that he has piles in his
 posteriors, till first he has consulted his dictionary, what piles and
 what posteriors are.

 We take other men's knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle
 and superficial learning. We must make it our own. We are in this very
 like him, who having need of fire, went to a neighbour's house to fetch
 it, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without
 remembering to carry any with him home.?[Plutarch, How a Man should
 Listen.]?What good does it do us to have the stomach full of meat,
 if it do not digest, if it be not incorporated with us, if it does not
 nourish and support us? Can we imagine that Lucullus, whom letters,
 without any manner of experience, made so great a captain, learned to be
 so after this perfunctory manner??[Cicero, Acad., ii. I.]?We
 suffer ourselves to lean and rely so strongly upon the arm of another,
 that we destroy our own strength and vigour. Would I fortify myself
 against the fear of death, it must be at the expense of Seneca: would I
 extract consolation for myself or my friend, I borrow it from Cicero. I
 might have found it in myself, had I been trained to make use of my own
 reason. I do not like this relative and mendicant understanding; for
 though we could become learned by other men's learning, a man can never be
 wise but by his own wisdom:
 </p><br>

 Dionysius?[It was not Dionysius, but Diogenes the cynic. Diogenes
 Laertius, vi. 27.]?laughed at the grammarians, who set themselves to
 inquire into the miseries of Ulysses, and were ignorant of their own; at
 musicians, who were so exact in tuning their instruments, and never tuned
 their manners; at orators, who made it a study to declare what is justice,
 but never took care to do it. If the mind be not better disposed, if the
 judgment be no better settled, I had much rather my scholar had spent his
 time at tennis, for, at least, his body would by that means be in better
 exercise and breath. Do but observe him when he comes back from school,
 after fifteen or sixteen years that he has been there; there is nothing so
 unfit for employment; all you shall find he has got, is, that his Latin
 and Greek have only made him a greater coxcomb than when he went from
 home. He should bring back his soul replete with good literature, and he
 brings it only swelled and puffed up with vain and empty shreds and
 patches of learning; and has really nothing more in him than he had
 before.?[Plato's Dialogues: Protagoras.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These pedants of ours, as Plato says of the Sophists, their
 cousin-germans, are, of all men, they who most pretend to be useful to
 mankind, and who alone, of all men, not only do not better and improve
 that which is committed to them, as a carpenter or a mason would do, but
 make them much worse, and make us pay them for making them worse, to boot.
 If the rule which Protagoras proposed to his pupils were followed ?either
 that they should give him his own demand, or make affidavit upon oath in
 the temple how much they valued the profit they had received under his
 tuition, and satisfy him accordingly?my pedagogues would find
 themselves sorely gravelled, if they were to be judged by the affidavits
 of my experience. My Perigordin patois very pleasantly calls these
 pretenders to learning, 'lettre-ferits', as a man should say,
 letter-marked?men on whom letters have been stamped by the blow of a
 mallet. And, in truth, for the most part, they appear to be deprived even
 of common sense; for you see the husbandman and the cobbler go simply and
 fairly about their business, speaking only of what they know and
 understand; whereas these fellows, to make parade and to get opinion,
 mustering this ridiculous knowledge of theirs, that floats on the
 superficies of the brain, are perpetually perplexing, and entangling
 themselves in their own nonsense. They speak fine words sometimes, 'tis
 true, but let somebody that is wiser apply them. They are wonderfully well
 acquainted with Galen, but not at all with the disease of the patient;
 they have already deafened you with a long ribble-row of laws, but
 understand nothing of the case in hand; they have the theory of all
 things, let who will put it in practice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have sat by, when a friend of mine, in my own house, for sport-sake, has
 with one of these fellows counterfeited a jargon of Galimatias, patched up
 of phrases without head or tail, saving that he interlarded here and there
 some terms that had relation to their dispute, and held the coxcomb in
 play a whole afternoon together, who all the while thought he had answered
 pertinently and learnedly to all his objections; and yet this was a man of
 letters, and reputation, and a fine gentleman of the long robe:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Vos, O patricius sanguis, quos vivere par est

 from behind."?Persius, Sat., i. 61.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Whosoever shall narrowly pry into and thoroughly sift this sort of people,
 wherewith the world is so pestered, will, as I have done, find, that for
 the most part, they neither understand others, nor themselves; and that
 their memories are full enough, but the judgment totally void and empty;
 some excepted, whose own nature has of itself formed them into better
 fashion. As I have observed, for example, in Adrian Turnebus, who having
 never made other profession than that of mere learning only, and in that,
 in my opinion, he was the greatest man that has been these thousand years,
 had nothing at all in him of the pedant, but the wearing of his gown, and
 a little exterior fashion, that could not be civilised to courtier ways,
 which in themselves are nothing. I hate our people, who can worse endure
 an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived mind, and take their measure
 by the leg a man makes, by his behaviour, and so much as the very fashion
 of his boots, what kind of man he is. For within there was not a more
 polished soul upon earth. I have often purposely put him upon arguments
 quite wide of his profession, wherein I found he had so clear an insight,
 so quick an apprehension, so solid a judgment, that a man would have
 thought he had never practised any other thing but arms, and been all his
 life employed in affairs of State. These are great and vigorous natures,

 Some of our Parliaments, when they are to admit officers, examine only
 their learning; to which some of the others also add the trial of
 understanding, by asking their judgment of some case in law; of these the
 latter, methinks, proceed with the better method; for although both are
 necessary, and that it is very requisite they should be defective in
 neither, yet, in truth, knowledge is not so absolutely necessary as
 judgment; the last may make shift without the other, but the other never
 without this. For as the Greek verse says?

 We are not to tie learning to the soul, but to work and incorporate them
 together: not to tincture it only, but to give it a thorough and perfect
 dye; which, if it will not take colour, and meliorate its imperfect state,
 it were without question better to let it alone. 'Tis a dangerous weapon,
 that will hinder and wound its master, if put into an awkward and
 unskilful hand:

 And this, peradventure, is the reason why neither we nor theology require
 much learning in women; and that Francis, Duke of Brittany, son of John
 V., one talking with him about his marriage with Isabella the daughter of
 Scotland, and adding that she was homely bred, and without any manner of
 learning, made answer, that he liked her the better, and that a woman was
 wise enough, if she could distinguish her husband's shirt from his
 doublet. So that it is no so great wonder, as they make of it, that our
 ancestors had letters in no greater esteem, and that even to this day they
 are but rarely met with in the principal councils of princes; and if the
 end and design of acquiring riches, which is the only thing we propose to
 ourselves, by the means of law, physic, pedantry, and even divinity
 itself, did not uphold and keep them in credit, you would, with doubt, see
 them in as pitiful a condition as ever. And what loss would this be, if
 they neither instruct us to think well nor to do well?

 All other knowledge is hurtful to him who has not the science of goodness.
 </p><br>

 But the reason I glanced upon but now, may it not also hence proceed,
 that, our studies in France having almost no other aim but profit, except
 as to those who, by nature born to offices and employments rather of glory
 than gain, addict themselves to letters, if at all, only for so short a
 time (being taken from their studies before they can come to have any
 taste of them, to a profession that has nothing to do with books), there
 ordinarily remain no others to apply themselves wholly to learning, but
 people of mean condition, who in that only seek the means to live; and by
 such people, whose souls are, both by nature and by domestic education and
 example, of the basest alloy the fruits of knowledge are immaturely
 gathered and ill digested, and delivered to their recipients quite another
 thing. For it is not for knowledge to enlighten a soul that is dark of
 itself, nor to make a blind man see. Her business is not to find a man's
 eyes, but to guide, govern, and direct them, provided he have sound feet
 and straight legs to go upon. Knowledge is an excellent drug, but no drug
 has virtue enough to preserve itself from corruption and decay, if the
 vessel be tainted and impure wherein it is put to keep. Such a one may
 have a sight clear enough who looks asquint, and consequently sees what is
 good, but does not follow it, and sees knowledge, but makes no use of it.
 Plato's principal institution in his Republic is to fit his citizens with
 employments suitable to their nature. Nature can do all, and does all.
 Cripples are very unfit for exercises of the body, and lame souls for
 exercises of the mind. Degenerate and vulgar souls are unworthy of
 philosophy. If we see a shoemaker with his shoes out at the toes, we say,
 'tis no wonder; for, commonly, none go worse shod than they. In like
 manner, experience often presents us a physician worse physicked, a divine
 less reformed, and (constantly) a scholar of less sufficiency, than other
 people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Old Aristo of Chios had reason to say that philosophers did their auditors
 harm, forasmuch as most of the souls of those that heard them were not
 capable of deriving benefit from instruction, which, if not applied to
 good, would certainly be applied to ill:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["They proceeded effeminate debauchees from the school of
 Aristippus, cynics from that of Zeno."
 ?Cicero, De Natura Deor., iii., 31.]
</pre>
 <p>
 In that excellent institution that Xenophon attributes to the Persians, we
 find that they taught their children virtue, as other nations do letters.
 Plato tells us that the eldest son in their royal succession was thus
 brought up; after his birth he was delivered, not to women, but to eunuchs
 of the greatest authority about their kings for their virtue, whose charge
 it was to keep his body healthful and in good plight; and after he came to
 seven years of age, to teach him to ride and to go a-hunting. When he
 arrived at fourteen he was transferred into the hands of four, the wisest,
 the most just, the most temperate, and most valiant of the nation; of whom
 the first was to instruct him in religion, the second to be always upright
 and sincere, the third to conquer his appetites and desires, and the
 fourth to despise all danger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is a thing worthy of very great consideration, that in that excellent,
 and, in truth, for its perfection, prodigious form of civil regimen set
 down by Lycurgus, though so solicitous of the education of children, as a
 thing of the greatest concern, and even in the very seat of the Muses, he
 should make so little mention of learning; as if that generous youth,
 disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue, ought to be supplied,
 instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences, with such masters as
 should only instruct them in valour, prudence, and justice; an example
 that Plato has followed in his laws. The manner of their discipline was to
 propound to them questions in judgment upon men and their actions; and if
 they commended or condemned this or that person or fact, they were to give
 a reason for so doing; by which means they at once sharpened their
 understanding, and learned what was right. Astyages, in Xenophon, asks
 Cyrus to give an account of his last lesson; and thus it was, "A great boy
 in our school, having a little short cassock, by force took a longer from
 another that was not so tall as he, and gave him his own in exchange:
 whereupon I, being appointed judge of the controversy, gave judgment, that
 I thought it best each should keep the coat he had, for that they both of
 them were better fitted with that of one another than with their own: upon
 which my master told me, I had done ill, in that I had only considered the
 fitness of the garments, whereas I ought to have considered the justice of
 the thing, which required that no one should have anything forcibly taken
 from him that is his own." And Cyrus adds that he was whipped for his
 pains, as we are in our villages for forgetting the first aorist of???.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [Cotton's version of this story commences differently, and includes
 a passage which is not in any of the editions of the original before
 me:

 "Mandane, in Xenophon, asking Cyrus how he would do to learn
 justice, and the other virtues amongst the Medes, having left all
 his masters behind him in Persia? He made answer, that he had
 learned those things long since; that his master had often made him
 a judge of the differences amongst his schoolfellows, and had one
 day whipped him for giving a wrong sentence."?W.C.H.]
</pre>
 <p>
 My pedant must make me a very learned oration, 'in genere demonstrativo',
 before he can persuade me that his school is like unto that. They knew how
 to go the readiest way to work; and seeing that science, when most rightly
 applied and best understood, can do no more but teach us prudence, moral
 honesty, and resolution, they thought fit, at first hand, to initiate
 their children with the knowledge of effects, and to instruct them, not by
 hearsay and rote, but by the experiment of action, in lively forming and
 moulding them; not only by words and precepts, but chiefly by works and
 examples; to the end it might not be a knowledge in the mind only, but its
 complexion and habit: not an acquisition, but a natural possession. One
 asking to this purpose, Agesilaus, what he thought most proper for boys to
 learn? "What they ought to do when they come to be men," said he.?[Plutarch,
 Apothegms of the Lacedamonians. Rousseau adopts the expression in his
 Diswuys sur tes Lettres.]?It is no wonder, if such an institution
 produced so admirable effects.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They used to go, it is said, to the other cities of Greece, to inquire out
 rhetoricians, painters, and musicians; but to Lacedaemon for legislators,
 magistrates, and generals of armies; at Athens they learned to speak well:
 here to do well; there to disengage themselves from a sophistical
 argument, and to unravel the imposture of captious syllogisms; here to
 evade the baits and allurements of pleasure, and with a noble courage and
 resolution to conquer the menaces of fortune and death; those cudgelled
 their brains about words, these made it their business to inquire into
 things; there was an eternal babble of the tongue, here a continual
 exercise of the soul. And therefore it is nothing strange if, when
 Antipater demanded of them fifty children for hostages, they made answer,
 quite contrary to what we should do, that they would rather give him twice
 as many full-grown men, so much did they value the loss of their country's
 education. When Agesilaus courted Xenophon to send his children to Sparta
 to be bred, "it is not," said he, "there to learn logic or rhetoric, but
 to be instructed in the noblest of all sciences, namely, the science to
 obey and to command."?[Plutarch, Life of Agesilaus, c. 7.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is very pleasant to see Socrates, after his manner, rallying Hippias,
 ?[Plato's Dialogues: Hippias Major.]?who recounts to him what
 a world of money he has got, especially in certain little villages of
 Sicily, by teaching school, and that he made never a penny at Sparta:
 "What a sottish and stupid people," said Socrates, "are they, without
 sense or understanding, that make no account either of grammar or poetry,
 and only busy themselves in studying the genealogies and successions of
 their kings, the foundations, rises, and declensions of states, and such
 tales of a tub!" After which, having made Hippias from one step to another
 acknowledge the excellency of their form of public administration, and the
 felicity and virtue of their private life, he leaves him to guess at the
 conclusion he makes of the inutilities of his pedantic arts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Examples have demonstrated to us that in military affairs, and all others
 of the like active nature, the study of sciences more softens and
 untempers the courages of men than it in any way fortifies and excites
 them. The most potent empire that at this day appears to be in the whole
 world is that of the Turks, a people equally inured to the estimation of
 arms and the contempt of letters. I find Rome was more valiant before she
 grew so learned. The most warlike nations at this time in being are the
 most rude and ignorant: the Scythians, the Parthians, Tamerlane, serve for
 sufficient proof of this. When the Goths overran Greece, the only thing
 that preserved all the libraries from the fire was, that some one
 possessed them with an opinion that they were to leave this kind of
 furniture entire to the enemy, as being most proper to divert them from
 the exercise of arms, and to fix them to a lazy and sedentary life. When
 our King Charles VIII., almost without striking a blow, saw himself
 possessed of the kingdom of Naples and a considerable part of Tuscany, the
 nobles about him attributed this unexpected facility of conquest to this,
 that the princes and nobles of Italy, more studied to render themselves
 ingenious and learned, than vigorous and warlike.

 CHAPTER XXV??OF THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN
 </h2>
 <h3>
 TO MADAME DIANE DE FOIX, Comtesse de Gurson
 </h3>
 <p>
 I never yet saw that father, but let his son be never so decrepit or
 deformed, would not, notwithstanding, own him: not, nevertheless, if he
 were not totally besotted, and blinded with his paternal affection, that
 he did not well enough discern his defects; but that with all defaults he
 was still his. Just so, I see better than any other, that all I write here
 are but the idle reveries of a man that has only nibbled upon the outward
 crust of sciences in his nonage, and only retained a general and formless
 image of them; who has got a little snatch of everything and nothing of
 the whole, 'a la Francoise'. For I know, in general, that there is such a
 thing as physic, as jurisprudence: four parts in mathematics, and,
 roughly, what all these aim and point at; and, peradventure, I yet know
 farther, what sciences in general pretend unto, in order to the service of
 our life: but to dive farther than that, and to have cudgelled my brains
 in the study of Aristotle, the monarch of all modern learning, or
 particularly addicted myself to any one science, I have never done it;
 neither is there any one art of which I am able to draw the first
 lineaments and dead colour; insomuch that there is not a boy of the lowest
 form in a school, that may not pretend to be wiser than I, who am not able
 to examine him in his first lesson, which, if I am at any time forced
 upon, I am necessitated in my own defence, to ask him, unaptly enough,
 some universal questions, such as may serve to try his natural
 understanding; a lesson as strange and unknown to him, as his is to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I never seriously settled myself to the reading any book of solid learning
 but Plutarch and Seneca; and there, like the Danaides, I eternally fill,
 and it as constantly runs out; something of which drops upon this paper,
 but little or nothing stays with me. History is my particular game as to
 matter of reading, or else poetry, for which I have particular kindness
 and esteem: for, as Cleanthes said, as the voice, forced through the
 narrow passage of a trumpet, comes out more forcible and shrill: so,
 methinks, a sentence pressed within the harmony of verse darts out more
 briskly upon the understanding, and strikes my ear and apprehension with a
 smarter and more pleasing effect. As to the natural parts I have, of which
 this is the essay, I find them to bow under the burden; my fancy and
 judgment do but grope in the dark, tripping and stumbling in the way; and
 when I have gone as far as I can, I am in no degree satisfied; I discover
 still a new and greater extent of land before me, with a troubled and
 imperfect sight and wrapped up in clouds, that I am not able to penetrate.
 And taking upon me to write indifferently of whatever comes into my head,
 and therein making use of nothing but my own proper and natural means, if
 it befall me, as oft-times it does, accidentally to meet in any good
 author, the same heads and commonplaces upon which I have attempted to
 write (as I did but just now in Plutarch's "Discourse of the Force of
 Imagination"), to see myself so weak and so forlorn, so heavy and so flat,
 in comparison of those better writers, I at once pity or despise myself.
 Yet do I please myself with this, that my opinions have often the honour
 and good fortune to jump with theirs, and that I go in the same path,
 though at a very great distance, and can say, "Ah, that is so." I am
 farther satisfied to find that I have a quality, which every one is not
 blessed withal, which is, to discern the vast difference between them and
 me; and notwithstanding all that, suffer my own inventions, low and feeble
 as they are, to run on in their career, without mending or plastering up
 the defects that this comparison has laid open to my own view. And, in
 plain truth, a man had need of a good strong back to keep pace with these
 people. The indiscreet scribblers of our times, who, amongst their
 laborious nothings, insert whole sections and pages out of ancient
 authors, with a design, by that means, to illustrate their own writings,
 do quite contrary; for this infinite dissimilitude of ornaments renders
 the complexion of their own compositions so sallow and deformed, that they
 lose much more than they get.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The philosophers, Chrysippus and Epicurus, were in this of two quite
 contrary humours: the first not only in his books mixed passages and
 sayings of other authors, but entire pieces, and, in one, the whole Medea
 of Euripides; which gave Apollodorus occasion to say, that should a man
 pick out of his writings all that was none of his, he would leave him
 nothing but blank paper: whereas the latter, quite on the contrary, in
 three hundred volumes that he left behind him, has not so much as one
 quotation.?[Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Chyysippus, vii. 181, and
 Epicurus, x. 26.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I happened the other day upon this piece of fortune; I was reading a
 French book, where after I had a long time run dreaming over a great many
 words, so dull, so insipid, so void of all wit or common sense, that
 indeed they were only French words: after a long and tedious travel, I
 came at last to meet with a piece that was lofty, rich, and elevated to
 the very clouds; of which, had I found either the declivity easy or the
 ascent gradual, there had been some excuse; but it was so perpendicular a
 precipice, and so wholly cut off from the rest of the work, that by the
 first six words, I found myself flying into the other world, and thence
 discovered the vale whence I came so deep and low, that I have never had
 since the heart to descend into it any more. If I should set out one of my
 discourses with such rich spoils as these, it would but too evidently
 manifest the imperfection of my own writing. To reprehend the fault in
 others that I am guilty of myself, appears to me no more unreasonable,
 than to condemn, as I often do, those of others in myself: they are to be
 everywhere reproved, and ought to have no sanctuary allowed them. I know
 very well how audaciously I myself, at every turn, attempt to equal myself
 to my thefts, and to make my style go hand in hand with them, not without
 a temerarious hope of deceiving the eyes of my reader from discerning the
 difference; but withal it is as much by the benefit of my application,
 that I hope to do it, as by that of my invention or any force of my own.
 Besides, I do not offer to contend with the whole body of these champions,
 nor hand to hand with anyone of them: 'tis only by flights and little
 light attempts that I engage them; I do not grapple with them, but try
 their strength only, and never engage so far as I make a show to do. If I
 could hold them in play, I were a brave fellow; for I never attack them;
 but where they are most sinewy and strong. To cover a man's self (as I
 have seen some do) with another man's armour, so as not to discover so
 much as his fingers' ends; to carry on a design (as it is not hard for a
 man that has anything of a scholar in him, in an ordinary subject to do)
 under old inventions patched up here and there with his own trumpery, and
 then to endeavour to conceal the theft, and to make it pass for his own,
 is first injustice and meanness of spirit in those who do it, who having
 nothing in them of their own fit to procure them a reputation, endeavour
 to do it by attempting to impose things upon the world in their own name,
 which they have no manner of title to; and next, a ridiculous folly to
 content themselves with acquiring the ignorant approbation of the vulgar
 by such a pitiful cheat, at the price at the same time of degrading
 themselves in the eyes of men of understanding, who turn up their noses at
 all this borrowed incrustation, yet whose praise alone is worth the
 having. For my own part, there is nothing I would not sooner do than that,
 neither have I said so much of others, but to get a better opportunity to
 explain myself. Nor in this do I glance at the composers of centos, who
 declare themselves for such; of which sort of writers I have in my time
 known many very ingenious, and particularly one under the name of
 Capilupus, besides the ancients. These are really men of wit, and that
 make it appear they are so, both by that and other ways of writing; as for
 example, Lipsius, in that learned and laborious contexture of his
 Politics.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, be it how it will, and how inconsiderable soever these ineptitudes
 may be, I will say I never intended to conceal them, no more than my old
 bald grizzled likeness before them, where the painter has presented you
 not with a perfect face, but with mine. For these are my own particular
 opinions and fancies, and I deliver them as only what I myself believe,
 and not for what is to be believed by others. I have no other end in this
 writing, but only to discover myself, who, also shall, peradventure, be
 another thing to-morrow, if I chance to meet any new instruction to change
 me. I have no authority to be believed, neither do I desire it, being too
 conscious of my own inerudition to be able to instruct others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some one, then, having seen the preceding chapter, the other day told me
 at my house, that I should a little farther have extended my discourse on
 the education of children.?["Which, how fit I am to do, let my
 friends flatter me if they please, I have in the meantime no such opinion
 of my own talent, as to promise myself any very good success from my
 endeavour." This passage would appear to be an interpolation by Cotton. At
 all events, I do not find it in the original editions before me, or in
 Coste.]?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, madam, if I had any sufficiency in this subject, I could not possibly
 better employ it, than to present my best instructions to the little man
 that threatens you shortly with a happy birth (for you are too generous to
 begin otherwise than with a male); for, having had so great a hand in the
 treaty of your marriage, I have a certain particular right and interest in
 the greatness and prosperity of the issue that shall spring from it;
 beside that, your having had the best of my services so long in
 possession, sufficiently obliges me to desire the honour and advantage of
 all wherein you shall be concerned. But, in truth, all I understand as to
 that particular is only this, that the greatest and most important
 difficulty of human science is the education of children. For as in
 agriculture, the husbandry that is to precede planting, as also planting
 itself, is certain, plain, and well known; but after that which is planted
 comes to life, there is a great deal more to be done, more art to be used,
 more care to be taken, and much more difficulty to cultivate and bring it
 to perfection so it is with men; it is no hard matter to get children; but
 after they are born, then begins the trouble, solicitude, and care rightly
 to train, principle, and bring them up. The symptoms of their inclinations
 in that tender age are so obscure, and the promises so uncertain and
 fallacious, that it is very hard to establish any solid judgment or
 conjecture upon them. Look at Cimon, for example, and Themistocles, and a
 thousand others, who very much deceived the expectation men had of them.
 Cubs of bears and puppies readily discover their natural inclination; but
 men, so soon as ever they are grownup, applying themselves to certain
 habits, engaging themselves in certain opinions, and conforming themselves
 to particular laws and customs, easily alter, or at least disguise, their
 true and real disposition; and yet it is hard to force the propension of
 nature. Whence it comes to pass, that for not having chosen the right
 course, we often take very great pains, and consume a good part of our
 time in training up children to things, for which, by their natural
 constitution, they are totally unfit. In this difficulty, nevertheless, I
 am clearly of opinion, that they ought to be elemented in the best and
 most advantageous studies, without taking too much notice of, or being too
 superstitious in those light prognostics they give of themselves in their
 tender years, and to which Plato, in his Republic, gives, methinks, too
 much authority.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madam, science is a very great ornament, and a thing of marvellous use,
 especially in persons raised to that degree of fortune in which you are.
 And, in truth, in persons of mean and low condition, it cannot perform its
 true and genuine office, being naturally more prompt to assist in the
 conduct of war, in the government of peoples, in negotiating the leagues
 and friendships of princes and foreign nations, than in forming a
 syllogism in logic, in pleading a process in law, or in prescribing a dose
 of pills in physic. Wherefore, madam, believing you will not omit this so
 necessary feature in the education of your children, who yourself have
 tasted its sweetness, and are of a learned extraction (for we yet have the
 writings of the ancient Counts of Foix, from whom my lord, your husband,
 and yourself, are both of you descended, and Monsieur de Candale, your
 uncle, every day obliges the world with others, which will extend the
 knowledge of this quality in your family for so many succeeding ages), I
 will, upon this occasion, presume to acquaint your ladyship with one
 particular fancy of my own, contrary to the common method, which is all I
 am able to contribute to your service in this affair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The charge of the tutor you shall provide for your son, upon the choice of
 whom depends the whole success of his education, has several other great
 and considerable parts and duties required in so important a trust,
 besides that of which I am about to speak: these, however, I shall not
 mention, as being unable to add anything of moment to the common rules:
 and in this, wherein I take upon me to advise, he may follow it so far
 only as it shall appear advisable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a, boy of quality then, who pretends to letters not upon the account
 of profit (for so mean an object is unworthy of the grace and favour of
 the Muses, and moreover, in it a man directs his service to and depends
 upon others), nor so much for outward ornament, as for his own proper and
 peculiar use, and to furnish and enrich himself within, having rather a
 desire to come out an accomplished cavalier than a mere scholar or learned
 man; for such a one, I say, I would, also, have his friends solicitous to
 find him out a tutor, who has rather a well-made than a well-filled head;?["'Tete
 bien faite', an expression created by Montaigne, and which has remained a
 part of our language."?Servan.]? seeking, indeed, both the one
 and the other, but rather of the two to prefer manners and judgment to
 mere learning, and that this man should exercise his charge after a new
 method.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis the custom of pedagogues to be eternally thundering in their pupil's
 ears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst the business of the pupil
 is only to repeat what the others have said: now I would have a tutor to
 correct this error, and, that at the very first, he should according to
 the capacity he has to deal with, put it to the test, permitting his pupil
 himself to taste things, and of himself to discern and choose them,
 sometimes opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving him to open it for
 himself; that is, I would not have him alone to invent and speak, but that
 he should also hear his pupil speak in turn. Socrates, and since him
 Arcesilaus, made first their scholars speak, and then they spoke to them?[Diogenes
 Laertius, iv. 36.]

 It is good to make him, like a young horse, trot before him, that he may
 judge of his going, and how much he is to abate of his own speed, to
 accommodate himself to the vigour and capacity of the other. For want of
 which due proportion we spoil all; which also to know how to adjust, and
 to keep within an exact and due measure, is one of the hardest things I
 know, and 'tis the effect of a high and well-tempered soul, to know how to
 condescend to such puerile motions and to govern and direct them. I walk
 firmer and more secure up hill than down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such as, according to our common way of teaching, undertake, with one and
 the same lesson, and the same measure of direction, to instruct several
 boys of differing and unequal capacities, are infinitely mistaken; and
 'tis no wonder, if in a whole multitude of scholars, there are not found
 above two or three who bring away any good account of their time and
 discipline. Let the master not only examine him about the grammatical
 construction of the bare words of his lesson, but about the sense and let
 him judge of the profit he has made, not by the testimony of his memory,
 but by that of his life. Let him make him put what he has learned into a
 hundred several forms, and accommodate it to so many several subjects, to
 see if he yet rightly comprehends it, and has made it his own, taking
 instruction of his progress by the pedagogic institutions of Plato. 'Tis a
 sign of crudity and indigestion to disgorge what we eat in the same
 condition it was swallowed; the stomach has not performed its office
 unless it have altered the form and condition of what was committed to it
 to concoct. Our minds work only upon trust, when bound and compelled to
 follow the appetite of another's fancy, enslaved and captivated under the
 authority of another's instruction; we have been so subjected to the
 trammel, that we have no free, nor natural pace of our own; our own vigour
 and liberty are extinct and gone:

 I was privately carried at Pisa to see a very honest man, but so great an
 Aristotelian, that his most usual thesis was: "That the touchstone and
 square of all solid imagination, and of all truth, was an absolute
 conformity to Aristotle's doctrine; and that all besides was nothing but
 inanity and chimera; for that he had seen all, and said all." A position,
 that for having been a little too injuriously and broadly interpreted,
 brought him once and long kept him in great danger of the Inquisition at
 Rome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let him make him examine and thoroughly sift everything he reads, and
 lodge nothing in his fancy upon simple authority and upon trust.
 Aristotle's principles will then be no more principles to him, than those
 of Epicurus and the Stoics: let this diversity of opinions be propounded
 to, and laid before him; he will himself choose, if he be able; if not, he
 will remain in doubt.

 for, if he embrace the opinions of Xenophon and Plato, by his own reason,
 they will no more be theirs, but become his own. Who follows another,

 Let him, at least, know that he knows. It will be necessary that he imbibe
 their knowledge, not that he be corrupted with their precepts; and no
 matter if he forget where he had his learning, provided he know how to
 apply it to his own use. Truth and reason are common to every one, and are
 no more his who spake them first, than his who speaks them after: 'tis no
 more according to Plato, than according to me, since both he and I equally
 see and understand them. Bees cull their several sweets from this flower
 and that blossom, here and there where they find them, but themselves
 afterwards make the honey, which is all and purely their own, and no more
 thyme and marjoram: so the several fragments he borrows from others, he
 will transform and shuffle together to compile a work that shall be
 absolutely his own; that is to say, his judgment: his instruction, labour
 and study, tend to nothing else but to form that. He is not obliged to
 discover whence he got the materials that have assisted him, but only to
 produce what he has himself done with them. Men that live upon pillage and
 borrowing, expose their purchases and buildings to every one's view: but
 do not proclaim how they came by the money. We do not see the fees and
 perquisites of a gentleman of the long robe; but we see the alliances
 wherewith he fortifies himself and his family, and the titles and honours
 he has obtained for him and his. No man divulges his revenue; or, at
 least, which way it comes in but every one publishes his acquisitions. The
 advantages of our study are to become better and more wise. 'Tis, says
 Epicharmus, the understanding that sees and hears, 'tis the understanding
 that improves everything, that orders everything, and that acts, rules,
 and reigns: all other faculties are blind, and deaf, and without soul. And
 certainly we render it timorous and servile, in not allowing it the
 liberty and privilege to do anything of itself. Whoever asked his pupil
 what he thought of grammar and rhetoric, or of such and such a sentence of
 Cicero? Our masters stick them, full feathered, in our memories, and there
 establish them like oracles, of which the letters and syllables are of the
 substance of the thing. To know by rote, is no knowledge, and signifies no
 more but only to retain what one has intrusted to our memory. That which a
 man rightly knows and understands, he is the free disposer of at his own
 full liberty, without any regard to the author from whence he had it, or
 fumbling over the leaves of his book. A mere bookish learning is a poor,
 paltry learning; it may serve for ornament, but there is yet no foundation
 for any superstructure to be built upon it, according to the opinion of
 Plato, who says, that constancy, faith, and sincerity, are the true
 philosophy, and the other sciences, that are directed to other ends; mere
 adulterate paint. I could wish that Paluel or Pompey, those two noted
 dancers of my time, could have taught us to cut capers, by only seeing
 them do it, without stirring from our places, as these men pretend to
 inform the understanding without ever setting it to work, or that we could
 learn to ride, handle a pike, touch a lute, or sing without the trouble of
 practice, as these attempt to make us judge and speak well, without
 exercising us in judging or speaking. Now in this initiation of our
 studies in their progress, whatsoever presents itself before us is book
 sufficient; a roguish trick of a page, a sottish mistake of a servant, a
 jest at the table, are so many new subjects.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And for this reason, conversation with men is of very great use and travel
 into foreign countries; not to bring back (as most of our young monsieurs
 do) an account only of how many paces Santa Rotonda?[The Pantheon of
 Agrippa.]?is in circuit; or of the richness of Signora Livia's
 petticoats; or, as some others, how much Nero's face, in a statue in such
 an old ruin, is longer and broader than that made for him on some medal;
 but to be able chiefly to give an account of the humours, manners,
 customs, and laws of those nations where he has been, and that we may whet
 and sharpen our wits by rubbing them against those of others. I would that
 a boy should be sent abroad very young, and first, so as to kill two birds
 with one stone, into those neighbouring nations whose language is most
 differing from our own, and to which, if it be not formed betimes, the
 tongue will grow too stiff to bend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And also 'tis the general opinion of all, that a child should not be
 brought up in his mother's lap. Mothers are too tender, and their natural
 affection is apt to make the most discreet of them all so overfond, that
 they can neither find in their hearts to give them due correction for the
 faults they may commit, nor suffer them to be inured to hardships and
 hazards, as they ought to be. They will not endure to see them return all
 dust and sweat from their exercise, to drink cold drink when they are hot,
 nor see them mount an unruly horse, nor take a foil in hand against a rude
 fencer, or so much as to discharge a carbine. And yet there is no remedy;
 whoever will breed a boy to be good for anything when he comes to be a
 man, must by no means spare him when young, and must very often transgress
 the rules of physic:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Vitamque sub dio, et trepidis agat
 In rebus."

 ["Let him live in open air, and ever in movement about something."
 ?Horace, Od. ii., 3, 5.]
</pre>
 <p>
 It is not enough to fortify his soul; you are also to make his sinews
 strong; for the soul will be oppressed if not assisted by the members, and
 would have too hard a task to discharge two offices alone. I know very
 well to my cost, how much mine groans under the burden, from being
 accommodated with a body so tender and indisposed, as eternally leans and
 presses upon her; and often in my reading perceive that our masters, in
 their writings, make examples pass for magnanimity and fortitude of mind,
 which really are rather toughness of skin and hardness of bones; for I
 have seen men, women, and children, naturally born of so hard and
 insensible a constitution of body, that a sound cudgelling has been less
 to them than a flirt with a finger would have been to me, and that would
 neither cry out, wince, nor shrink, for a good swinging beating; and when
 wrestlers counterfeit the philosophers in patience, 'tis rather strength
 of nerves than stoutness of heart. Now to be inured to undergo labour, is
 to be accustomed to endure pain:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Labor callum obducit dolori."

 ["Labour hardens us against pain."?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 15.]
</pre>
 <p>
 A boy is to be broken in to the toil and roughness of exercise, so as to
 be trained up to the pain and suffering of dislocations, cholics,
 cauteries, and even imprisonment and the rack itself; for he may come by
 misfortune to be reduced to the worst of these, which (as this world goes)
 is sometimes inflicted on the good as well as the bad. As for proof, in
 our present civil war whoever draws his sword against the laws, threatens
 the honestest men with the whip and the halter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, moreover, by living at home, the authority of this governor, which
 ought to be sovereign over the boy he has received into his charge, is
 often checked and hindered by the presence of parents; to which may also
 be added, that the respect the whole family pay him, as their master's
 son, and the knowledge he has of the estate and greatness he is heir to,
 are, in my opinion, no small inconveniences in these tender years.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet, even in this conversing with men I spoke of but now, I have
 observed this vice, that instead of gathering observations from others, we
 make it our whole business to lay ourselves open to them, and are more
 concerned how to expose and set out our own commodities, than how to
 increase our stock by acquiring new. Silence, therefore, and modesty are
 very advantageous qualities in conversation. One should, therefore, train
 up this boy to be sparing and an husband of his knowledge when he has
 acquired it; and to forbear taking exceptions at or reproving every idle
 saying or ridiculous story that is said or told in his presence; for it is
 a very unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything that is not agreeable to
 our own palate. Let him be satisfied with correcting himself, and not seem
 to condemn everything in another he would not do himself, nor dispute it
 as against common customs.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Licet sapere sine pompa, sine invidia."

 ["Let us be wise without ostentation, without envy."
 ?Seneca, Ep., 103.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Let him avoid these vain and uncivil images of authority, this childish
 ambition of coveting to appear better bred and more accomplished, than he
 really will, by such carriage, discover himself to be. And, as if
 opportunities of interrupting and reprehending were not to be omitted, to
 desire thence to derive the reputation of something more than ordinary.
 For as it becomes none but great poets to make use of the poetical
 licence, so it is intolerable for any but men of great and illustrious
 souls to assume privilege above the authority of custom:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si quid Socrates ant Aristippus contra morem et consuetudinem
 fecerunt, idem sibi ne arbitretur licere: magnis enim illi et
 divinis bonis hanc licentiam assequebantur."

 ["If Socrates and Aristippus have committed any act against manners
 and custom, let him not think that he is allowed to do the same; for
 it was by great and divine benefits that they obtained this
 privilege."?Cicero, De Offic., i. 41.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Let him be instructed not to engage in discourse or dispute but with a
 champion worthy of him, and, even there, not to make use of all the little
 subtleties that may seem pat for his purpose, but only such arguments as
 may best serve him. Let him be taught to be curious in the election and
 choice of his reasons, to abominate impertinence, and consequently, to
 affect brevity; but, above all, let him be lessoned to acquiesce and
 submit to truth so soon as ever he shall discover it, whether in his
 opponent's argument, or upon better consideration of his own; for he shall
 never be preferred to the chair for a mere clatter of words and
 syllogisms, and is no further engaged to any argument whatever, than as he
 shall in his own judgment approve it: nor yet is arguing a trade, where
 the liberty of recantation and getting off upon better thoughts, are to be
 sold for ready money:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Neque, ut omnia, qux praescripta et imperata sint,
 defendat, necessitate ulla cogitur."

 ["Neither is their any necessity upon him, that he should defend
 all things that are prescribed and enjoined him."
 ?Cicero, Acad., ii. 3.]
</pre>
 <p>
 If his governor be of my humour, he will form his will to be a very good
 and loyal subject to his prince, very affectionate to his person, and very
 stout in his quarrel; but withal he will cool in him the desire of having
 any other tie to his service than public duty. Besides several other
 inconveniences that are inconsistent with the liberty every honest man
 ought to have, a man's judgment, being bribed and prepossessed by these
 particular obligations, is either blinded and less free to exercise its
 function, or is blemished with ingratitude and indiscretion. A man that is
 purely a courtier, can neither have power nor will to speak or think
 otherwise than favourably and well of a master, who, amongst so many
 millions of other subjects, has picked out him with his own hand to
 nourish and advance; this favour, and the profit flowing from it, must
 needs, and not without some show of reason, corrupt his freedom and dazzle
 him; and we commonly see these people speak in another kind of phrase than
 is ordinarily spoken by others of the same nation, though what they say in
 that courtly language is not much to be believed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let his conscience and virtue be eminently manifest in his speaking, and
 have only reason for their guide. Make him understand, that to acknowledge
 the error he shall discover in his own argument, though only found out by
 himself, is an effect of judgment and sincerity, which are the principal
 things he is to seek after; that obstinacy and contention are common
 qualities, most appearing in mean souls; that to revise and correct
 himself, to forsake an unjust argument in the height and heat of dispute,
 are rare, great, and philosophical qualities.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let him be advised, being in company, to have his eye and ear in every
 corner; for I find that the places of greatest honour are commonly seized
 upon by men that have least in them, and that the greatest fortunes are
 seldom accompanied with the ablest parts. I have been present when, whilst
 they at the upper end of the chamber have been only commenting the beauty
 of the arras, or the flavour of the wine, many things that have been very
 finely said at the lower end of the table have been lost and thrown away.
 Let him examine every man's talent; a peasant, a bricklayer, a passenger:
 one may learn something from every one of these in their several
 capacities, and something will be picked out of their discourse whereof
 some use may be made at one time or another; nay, even the folly and
 impertinence of others will contribute to his instruction. By observing
 the graces and manners of all he sees, he will create to himself an
 emulation of the good, and a contempt of the bad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let an honest curiosity be suggested to his fancy of being inquisitive
 after everything; whatever there is singular and rare near the place where
 he is, let him go and see it; a fine house, a noble fountain, an eminent
 man, the place where a battle has been anciently fought, the passages of
 Caesar and Charlemagne:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Qux tellus sit lenta gelu, quae putris ab aestu,
 Ventus in Italiam quis bene vela ferat."

 ["What country is bound in frost, what land is friable with heat,
 what wind serves fairest for Italy."?Propertius, iv. 3, 39.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Let him inquire into the manners, revenues, and alliances of princes,
 things in themselves very pleasant to learn, and very useful to know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In this conversing with men, I mean also, and principally, those who only
 live in the records of history; he shall, by reading those books, converse
 with the great and heroic souls of the best ages. 'Tis an idle and vain
 study to those who make it so by doing it after a negligent manner, but to
 those who do it with care and observation, 'tis a study of inestimable
 fruit and value; and the only study, as Plato reports, that the
 Lacedaemonians reserved to themselves. What profit shall he not reap as to
 the business of men, by reading the Lives of Plutarch? But, withal, let my
 governor remember to what end his instructions are principally directed,
 and that he do not so much imprint in his pupil's memory the date of the
 ruin of Carthage, as the manners of Hannibal and Scipio; nor so much where
 Marcellus died, as why it was unworthy of his duty that he died there. Let
 him not teach him so much the narrative parts of history as to judge them;
 the reading of them, in my opinion, is a thing that of all others we apply
 ourselves unto with the most differing measure. I have read a hundred
 things in Livy that another has not, or not taken notice of at least; and
 Plutarch has read a hundred more there than ever I could find, or than,
 peradventure, that author ever wrote; to some it is merely a grammar
 study, to others the very anatomy of philosophy, by which the most
 abstruse parts of our human nature penetrate. There are in Plutarch many
 long discourses very worthy to be carefully read and observed, for he is,
 in my opinion, of all others the greatest master in that kind of writing;
 but there are a thousand others which he has only touched and glanced
 upon, where he only points with his finger to direct us which way we may
 go if we will, and contents himself sometimes with giving only one brisk
 hit in the nicest article of the question, whence we are to grope out the
 rest. As, for example, where he says'?[In the Essay on False Shame.]?that
 the inhabitants of Asia came to be vassals to one only, for not having
 been able to pronounce one syllable, which is No. Which saying of his gave
 perhaps matter and occasion to La Boetie to write his "Voluntary
 Servitude." Only to see him pick out a light action in a man's life, or a
 mere word that does not seem to amount even to that, is itself a whole
 discourse. 'Tis to our prejudice that men of understanding should so
 immoderately affect brevity; no doubt their reputation is the better by
 it, but in the meantime we are the worse. Plutarch had rather we should
 applaud his judgment than commend his knowledge, and had rather leave us
 with an appetite to read more, than glutted with that we have already
 read. He knew very well, that a man may say too much even upon the best
 subjects, and that Alexandridas justly reproached him who made very good.
 but too long speeches to the Ephori, when he said: "O stranger! thou
 speakest the things thou shouldst speak, but not as thou shouldst speak
 them."?[Plutarch, Apothegms of the Lacedamonians.]?Such as
 have lean and spare bodies stuff themselves out with clothes; so they who
 are defective in matter endeavour to make amends with words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Human understanding is marvellously enlightened by daily conversation with
 men, for we are, otherwise, compressed and heaped up in ourselves, and
 have our sight limited to the length of our own noses. One asking Socrates
 of what country he was, he did not make answer, of Athens, but of the
 world;?[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 37; Plutarch, On Exile, c. 4.]?
 he whose imagination was fuller and wider, embraced the whole world for
 his country, and extended his society and friendship to all mankind; not
 as we do, who look no further than our feet. When the vines of my village
 are nipped with the frost, my parish priest presently concludes, that the
 indignation of God has gone out against all the human race, and that the
 cannibals have already got the pip. Who is it that, seeing the havoc of
 these civil wars of ours, does not cry out, that the machine of the world
 is near dissolution, and that the day of judgment is at hand; without
 considering, that many worse things have been seen, and that in the
 meantime, people are very merry in a thousand other parts of the earth for
 all this? For my part, considering the licence and impunity that always
 attend such commotions, I wonder they are so moderate, and that there is
 no more mischief done. To him who feels the hailstones patter about his
 ears, the whole hemisphere appears to be in storm and tempest; like the
 ridiculous Savoyard, who said very gravely, that if that simple king of
 France could have managed his fortune as he should have done, he might in
 time have come to have been steward of the household to the duke his
 master: the fellow could not, in his shallow imagination, conceive that
 there could be anything greater than a Duke of Savoy. And, in truth, we
 are all of us, insensibly, in this error, an error of a very great weight
 and very pernicious consequence. But whoever shall represent to his fancy,
 as in a picture, that great image of our mother nature, in her full
 majesty and lustre, whoever in her face shall read so general and so
 constant a variety, whoever shall observe himself in that figure, and not
 himself but a whole kingdom, no bigger than the least touch or prick of a
 pencil in comparison of the whole, that man alone is able to value things
 according to their true estimate and grandeur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This great world which some do yet multiply as several species under one
 genus, is the mirror wherein we are to behold ourselves, to be able to
 know ourselves as we ought to do in the true bias. In short, I would have
 this to be the book my young gentleman should study with the most
 attention. So many humours, so many sects, so many judgments, opinions,
 laws, and customs, teach us to judge aright of our own, and inform our
 understanding to discover its imperfection and natural infirmity, which is
 no trivial speculation. So many mutations of states and kingdoms, and so
 many turns and revolutions of public fortune, will make us wise enough to
 make no great wonder of our own. So many great names, so many famous
 victories and conquests drowned and swallowed in oblivion, render our
 hopes ridiculous of eternising our names by the taking of half-a-score of
 light horse, or a henroost, which only derives its memory from its ruin.
 The pride and arrogance of so many foreign pomps, the inflated majesty of
 so many courts and grandeurs, accustom and fortify our sight without
 closing our eyes to behold the lustre of our own; so many trillions of
 men, buried before us, encourage us not to fear to go seek such good
 company in the other world: and so of the rest Pythagoras was want to say,?[Cicero,
 Tusc. Quaes., v. 3.]?that our life resembles the great and populous
 assembly of the Olympic games, wherein some exercise the body, that they
 may carry away the glory of the prize: others bring merchandise to sell
 for profit: there are also some (and those none of the worst sort) who
 pursue no other advantage than only to look on, and consider how and why
 everything is done, and to be spectators of the lives of other men,
 thereby the better to judge of and regulate their own.

 by what secret springs we move, and the reason of our various agitations
 and irresolutions: for, methinks the first doctrine with which one should
 season his understanding, ought to be that which regulates his manners and
 his sense; that teaches him to know himself, and how both well to dig and
 well to live. Amongst the liberal sciences, let us begin with that which
 makes us free; not that they do not all serve in some measure to the
 instruction and use of life, as all other things in some sort also do; but
 let us make choice of that which directly and professedly serves to that
 end. If we are once able to restrain the offices of human life within
 their just and natural limits, we shall find that most of the sciences in
 use are of no great use to us, and even in those that are, that there are
 many very unnecessary cavities and dilatations which we had better let
 alone, and, following Socrates' direction, limit the course of our studies
 to those things only where is a true and real utility:

 After having taught him what will make him more wise and good, you may
 then entertain him with the elements of logic, physics, geometry,
 rhetoric, and the science which he shall then himself most incline to, his
 judgment being beforehand formed and fit to choose, he will quickly make
 his own. The way of instructing him ought to be sometimes by discourse,
 and sometimes by reading; sometimes his governor shall put the author
 himself, which he shall think most proper for him, into his hands, and
 sometimes only the marrow and substance of it; and if himself be not
 conversant enough in books to turn to all the fine discourses the books
 contain for his purpose, there may some man of learning be joined to him,
 that upon every occasion shall supply him with what he stands in need of,
 to furnish it to his pupil. And who can doubt but that this way of
 teaching is much more easy and natural than that of Gaza,?[Theodore
 Gaza, rector of the Academy of Ferrara.]?in which the precepts are
 so intricate, and so harsh, and the words so vain, lean; and
 insignificant, that there is no hold to be taken of them, nothing that
 quickens and elevates the wit and fancy, whereas here the mind has what to
 feed upon and to digest. This fruit, therefore, is not only without
 comparison, much more fair and beautiful; but will also be much more early
 ripe.

 'Tis a thousand pities that matters should be at such a pass in this age
 of ours, that philosophy, even with men of understanding, should be,
 looked upon as a vain and fantastic name, a thing of no use, no value,
 either in opinion or effect, of which I think those ergotisms and petty
 sophistries, by prepossessing the avenues to it, are the cause. And people
 are much to blame to represent it to children for a thing of so difficult
 access, and with such a frowning, grim, and formidable aspect. Who is it
 that has disguised it thus, with this false, pale, and ghostly
 countenance? There is nothing more airy, more gay, more frolic, and I had
 like to have said, more wanton. She preaches nothing but feasting and
 jollity; a melancholic anxious look shows that she does not inhabit there.
 Demetrius the grammarian finding in the temple of Delphos a knot of
 philosophers set chatting together, said to them,?[Plutarch,
 Treatise on Oracles which have ceased]?"Either I am much deceived,
 or by your cheerful and pleasant countenances, you are engaged in no, very
 deep discourse." To which one of them, Heracleon the Megarean, replied:
 "Tis for such as are puzzled about inquiring whether the future tense of
 the verb ??? is spelt with a double A, or that hunt
 after the derivation of the comparatives ??- and ??-,
 and the superlatives ?? and ???, to knit
 their brows whilst discoursing of their science: but as to philosophical
 discourses, they always divert and cheer up those that entertain them, and
 never deject them or make them sad."

 <p>
 The soul that lodges philosophy, ought to be of such a constitution of
 health, as to render the body in like manner healthful too; she ought to
 make her tranquillity and satisfaction shine so as to appear without, and
 her contentment ought to fashion the outward behaviour to her own mould,
 and consequently to fortify it with a graceful confidence, an active and
 joyous carriage, and a serene and contented countenance. The most manifest
 sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness; her state is like that of
 things in the regions above the moon, always clear and serene. 'Tis Baroco
 and Baralipton?[Two terms of the ancient scholastic logic.]?that
 render their disciples so dirty and ill-favoured, and not she; they do not
 so much as know her but by hearsay. What! It is she that calms and
 appeases the storms and tempests of the soul, and who teaches famine and
 fevers to laugh and sing; and that, not by certain imaginary epicycles,
 but by natural and manifest reasons. She has virtue for her end, which is
 not, as the schoolmen say, situate upon the summit of a perpendicular,
 rugged, inaccessible precipice: such as have approached her find her,
 quite on the contrary, to be seated in a fair, fruitful, and flourishing
 plain, whence she easily discovers all things below; to which place any
 one may, however, arrive, if he know but the way, through shady, green,
 and sweetly-flourishing avenues, by a pleasant, easy, and smooth descent,
 like that of the celestial vault. 'Tis for not having frequented this
 supreme, this beautiful, triumphant, and amiable, this equally delicious
 and courageous virtue, this so professed and implacable enemy to anxiety,
 sorrow, fear, and constraint, who, having nature for her guide, has
 fortune and pleasure for her companions, that they have gone, according to
 their own weak imagination, and created this ridiculous, this sorrowful,
 querulous, despiteful, threatening, terrible image of it to themselves and
 others, and placed it upon a rock apart, amongst thorns and brambles, and
 made of it a hobgoblin to affright people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the governor that I would have, that is such a one as knows it to be
 his duty to possess his pupil with as much or more affection than
 reverence to virtue, will be able to inform him, that the poets have
 evermore accommodated themselves to the public humour, and make him
 sensible, that the gods have planted more toil and sweat in the avenues of
 the cabinets of Venus than in those of Minerva. And when he shall once
 find him begin to apprehend, and shall represent to him a Bradamante or an
 Angelica?[Heroines of Ariosto.]?for a mistress, a natural,
 active, generous, and not a viragoish, but a manly beauty, in comparison
 of a soft, delicate, artificial simpering, and affected form; the one in
 the habit of a heroic youth, wearing a glittering helmet, the other
 tricked up in curls and ribbons like a wanton minx; he will then look upon
 his own affection as brave and masculine, when he shall choose quite
 contrary to that effeminate shepherd of Phrygia.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such a tutor will make a pupil digest this new lesson, that the height and
 value of true virtue consists in the facility, utility, and pleasure of
 its exercise; so far from difficulty, that boys, as well as men, and the
 innocent as well as the subtle, may make it their own; it is by order, and
 not by force, that it is to be acquired. Socrates, her first minion, is so
 averse to all manner of violence, as totally to throw it aside, to slip
 into the more natural facility of her own progress; 'tis the nursing
 mother of all human pleasures, who in rendering them just, renders them
 also pure and permanent; in moderating them, keeps them in breath and
 appetite; in interdicting those which she herself refuses, whets our
 desire to those that she allows; and, like a kind and liberal mother,
 abundantly allows all that nature requires, even to satiety, if not to
 lassitude: unless we mean to say that the regimen which stops the toper
 before he has drunk himself drunk, the glutton before he has eaten to a
 surfeit, and the lecher before he has got the pox, is an enemy to
 pleasure. If the ordinary fortune fail, she does without it, and forms
 another, wholly her own, not so fickle and unsteady as the other. She can
 be rich, be potent and wise, and knows how to lie upon soft perfumed beds:
 she loves life, beauty, glory, and health; but her proper and peculiar
 office is to know how to regulate the use of all these good things, and
 how to lose them without concern: an office much more noble than
 troublesome, and without which the whole course of life is unnatural,
 turbulent, and deformed, and there it is indeed, that men may justly
 represent those monsters upon rocks and precipices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If this pupil shall happen to be of so contrary a disposition, that he had
 rather hear a tale of a tub than the true narrative of some noble
 expedition or some wise and learned discourse; who at the beat of drum,
 that excites the youthful ardour of his companions, leaves that to follow
 another that calls to a morris or the bears; who would not wish, and find
 it more delightful and more excellent, to return all dust and sweat
 victorious from a battle, than from tennis or from a ball, with the prize
 of those exercises; I see no other remedy, but that he be bound prentice
 in some good town to learn to make minced pies, though he were the son of
 a duke; according to Plato's precept, that children are to be placed out
 and disposed of, not according to the wealth, qualities, or condition of
 the father, but according to the faculties and the capacity of their own
 souls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since philosophy is that which instructs us to live, and that infancy has
 there its lessons as well as other ages, why is it not communicated to
 children betimes?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Udum et molle lutum est; nunc, nunc properandus, et acri

 <p>
 They begin to teach us to live when we have almost done living. A hundred
 students have got the pox before they have come to read Aristotle's
 lecture on temperance. Cicero said, that though he should live two men's
 ages, he should never find leisure to study the lyric poets; and I find
 these sophisters yet more deplorably unprofitable. The boy we would breed
 has a great deal less time to spare; he owes but the first fifteen or
 sixteen years of his life to education; the remainder is due to action.
 Let us, therefore, employ that short time in necessary instruction. Away
 with the thorny subtleties of dialectics; they are abuses, things by which
 our lives can never be amended: take the plain philosophical discourses,
 learn how rightly to choose, and then rightly to apply them; they are more
 easy to be understood than one of Boccaccio's novels; a child from nurse
 is much more capable of them, than of learning to read or to write.
 Philosophy has discourses proper for childhood, as well as for the
 decrepit age of men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I am of Plutarch's mind, that Aristotle did not so much trouble his great
 disciple with the knack of forming syllogisms, or with the elements of
 geometry; as with infusing into him good precepts concerning valour,
 prowess, magnanimity, temperance, and the contempt of fear; and with this
 ammunition, sent him, whilst yet a boy, with no more than thirty thousand
 foot, four thousand horse, and but forty-two thousand crowns, to subjugate
 the empire of the whole earth. For the other acts and sciences, he says,
 Alexander highly indeed commended their excellence and charm, and had them
 in very great honour and esteem, but not ravished with them to that degree
 as to be tempted to affect the practice of them In his own person:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Petite hinc, juvenesque senesque,
 Finem ammo certum, miserisque viatica canis."

 ["Young men and old men, derive hence a certain end to the mind,

</pre>
 <p>
 Epicurus, in the beginning of his letter to Meniceus,?[Diogenes
 Laertius, x. 122.]?says, "That neither the youngest should refuse to
 philosophise, nor the oldest grow weary of it." Who does otherwise, seems
 tacitly to imply, that either the time of living happily is not yet come,
 or that it is already past. And yet, a for all that, I would not have this
 pupil of ours imprisoned and made a slave to his book; nor would I have
 him given up to the morosity and melancholic humour of a sour ill-natured
 pedant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I would not have his spirit cowed and subdued, by applying him to the
 rack, and tormenting him, as some do, fourteen or fifteen hours a day, and
 so make a pack-horse of him. Neither should I think it good, when, by
 reason of a solitary and melancholic complexion, he is discovered to be
 overmuch addicted to his book, to nourish that humour in him; for that
 renders him unfit for civil conversation, and diverts him from better
 employments. And how many have I seen in my time totally brutified by an
 immoderate thirst after knowledge? Carneades was so besotted with it, that
 he would not find time so much as to comb his head or to pare his nails.
 Neither would I have his generous manners spoiled and corrupted by the
 incivility and barbarism of those of another. The French wisdom was
 anciently turned into proverb: "Early, but of no continuance." And, in
 truth, we yet see, that nothing can be more ingenious and pleasing than
 the children of France; but they ordinarily deceive the hope and
 expectation that have been conceived of them; and grown up to be men, have
 nothing extraordinary or worth taking notice of: I have heard men of good
 understanding say, these colleges of ours to which we send our young
 people (and of which we have but too many) make them such animals as they
 are.?[Hobbes said that if he Had been at college as long as other
 people he should have been as great a blockhead as they. W.C.H.] [And
 Bacon before Hobbe's time had discussed the "futility" of university
 teaching. D.W.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But to our little monsieur, a closet, a garden, the table, his bed,
 solitude, and company, morning and evening, all hours shall be the same,
 and all places to him a study; for philosophy, who, as the formatrix of
 judgment and manners, shall be his principal lesson, has that privilege to
 have a hand in everything. The orator Isocrates, being at a feast
 entreated to speak of his art, all the company were satisfied with and
 commended his answer: "It is not now a time," said he, "to do what I can
 do; and that which it is now time to do, I cannot do."?[Plutarch,
 Symp., i. I.]?For to make orations and rhetorical disputes in a
 company met together to laugh and make good cheer, had been very
 unreasonable and improper, and as much might have been said of all the
 other sciences. But as to what concerns philosophy, that part of it at
 least that treats of man, and of his offices and duties, it has been the
 common opinion of all wise men, that, out of respect to the sweetness of
 her conversation, she is ever to be admitted in all sports and
 entertainments. And Plato, having invited her to his feast, we see after
 how gentle and obliging a manner, accommodated both to time and place, she
 entertained the company, though in a discourse of the highest and most
 important nature:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque;
 Et, neglecta, aeque pueris senibusque nocebit."

 ["It profits poor and rich alike, but, neglected, equally hurts old
 and young."?Horace, Ep., i. 25.]
</pre>
 <p>
 By this method of instruction, my young pupil will be much more and better
 employed than his fellows of the college are. But as the steps we take in
 walking to and fro in a gallery, though three times as many, do not tire a
 man so much as those we employ in a formal journey, so our lesson, as it
 were accidentally occurring, without any set obligation of time or place,
 and falling naturally into every action, will insensibly insinuate itself.
 By which means our very exercises and recreations, running, wrestling,
 music, dancing, hunting, riding, and fencing, will prove to be a good part
 of our study. I would have his outward fashion and mien, and the
 disposition of his limbs, formed at the same time with his mind. 'Tis not
 a soul, 'tis not a body that we are training up, but a man, and we ought
 not to divide him. And, as Plato says, we are not to fashion one without
 the other, but make them draw together like two horses harnessed to a
 coach. By which saying of his, does he not seem to allow more time for,
 and to take more care of exercises for the body, and to hold that the
 mind, in a good proportion, does her business at the same time too?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As to the rest, this method of education ought to be carried on with a
 severe sweetness, quite contrary to the practice of our pedants, who,
 instead of tempting and alluring children to letters by apt and gentle
 ways, do in truth present nothing before them but rods and ferules, horror
 and cruelty. Away with this violence! away with this compulsion! than
 which, I certainly believe nothing more dulls and degenerates a
 well-descended nature. If you would have him apprehend shame and
 chastisement, do not harden him to them: inure him to heat and cold, to
 wind and sun, and to dangers that he ought to despise; wean him from all
 effeminacy and delicacy in clothes and lodging, eating and drinking;
 accustom him to everything, that he may not be a Sir Paris, a
 carpet-knight, but a sinewy, hardy, and vigorous young man. I have ever
 from a child to the age wherein I now am, been of this opinion, and am
 still constant to it. But amongst other things, the strict government of
 most of our colleges has evermore displeased me; peradventure, they might
 have erred less perniciously on the indulgent side. 'Tis a real house of
 correction of imprisoned youth. They are made debauched by being punished
 before they are so. Do but come in when they are about their lesson, and
 you shall hear nothing but the outcries of boys under execution, with the
 thundering noise of their pedagogues drunk with fury. A very pretty way
 this, to tempt these tender and timorous souls to love their book, with a
 furious countenance, and a rod in hand! A cursed and pernicious way of
 proceeding! Besides what Quintilian has very well observed, that this
 imperious authority is often attended by very dangerous consequences, and
 particularly our way of chastising. How much more decent would it be to
 see their classes strewed with green leaves and fine flowers, than with
 the bloody stumps of birch and willows? Were it left to my ordering. I
 should paint the school with the pictures of joy and gladness; Flora and
 the Graces, as the philosopher Speusippus did his. Where their profit is,
 let them there have their pleasure too. Such viands as are proper and
 wholesome for children, should be sweetened with sugar, and such as are
 dangerous to them, embittered with gall. 'Tis marvellous to see how
 solicitous Plato is in his Laws concerning the gaiety and diversion of the
 youth of his city, and how much and often he enlarges upon the races,
 sports, songs, leaps, and dances: of which, he says, that antiquity has
 given the ordering and patronage particularly to the gods themselves, to
 Apollo, Minerva, and the Muses. He insists long upon, and is very
 particular in, giving innumerable precepts for exercises; but as to the
 lettered sciences, says very little, and only seems particularly to
 recommend poetry upon the account of music.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All singularity in our manners and conditions is to be avoided, as
 inconsistent with civil society. Who would not be astonished at so strange
 a constitution as that of Demophoon, steward to Alexander the Great, who
 sweated in the shade and shivered in the sun? I have seen those who have
 run from the smell of a mellow apple with greater precipitation than from
 a harquebuss-shot; others afraid of a mouse; others vomit at the sight of
 cream; others ready to swoon at the making of a feather bed; Germanicus
 could neither endure the sight nor the crowing of a cock. I will not deny,
 but that there may, peradventure, be some occult cause and natural
 aversion in these cases; but, in my opinion, a man might conquer it, if he
 took it in time. Precept has in this wrought so effectually upon me,
 though not without some pains on my part, I confess, that beer excepted,
 my appetite accommodates itself indifferently to all sorts of diet. Young
 bodies are supple; one should, therefore, in that age bend and ply them to
 all fashions and customs: and provided a man can contain the appetite and
 the will within their due limits, let a young man, in God's name, be
 rendered fit for all nations and all companies, even to debauchery and
 excess, if need be; that is, where he shall do it out of complacency to
 the customs of the place. Let him be able to do everything, but love to do
 nothing but what is good. The philosophers themselves do not justify
 Callisthenes for forfeiting the favour of his master Alexander the Great,
 by refusing to pledge him a cup of wine. Let him laugh, play, wench with
 his prince: nay, I would have him, even in his debauches, too hard for the
 rest of the company, and to excel his companions in ability and vigour,
 and that he may not give over doing it, either through defect of power or
 knowledge how to do it, but for want of will.

 whole story of his debauches. I know some who, for want of this faculty,
 have found a great inconvenience in negotiating with that nation. I have
 often with great admiration reflected upon the wonderful constitution of
 Alcibiades, who so easily could transform himself to so various fashions
 without any prejudice to his health; one while outdoing the Persian pomp
 and luxury, and another, the Lacedaemonian austerity and frugality; as
 reformed in Sparta, as voluptuous in Ionia:

 These are my lessons, and he who puts them in practice shall reap more

 "pretend to it with so much the more reason." Hegesias entreated that he
 would read a certain book to him: "You are pleasant," said he; "you choose
 those figs that are true and natural, and not those that are painted; why
 do you not also choose exercises which are naturally true, rather than

 The conduct of our lives is the true mirror of our doctrine. Zeuxidamus,
 to one who asked him, why the Lacedaemonians did not commit their
 constitutions of chivalry to writing, and deliver them to their young men
 to read, made answer, that it was because they would inure them to action,
 and not amuse them with words. With such a one, after fifteen or sixteen
 years' study, compare one of our college Latinists, who has thrown away so
 much time in nothing but learning to speak. The world is nothing but
 babble; and I hardly ever yet saw that man who did not rather prate too
 much, than speak too little. And yet half of our age is embezzled this
 way: we are kept four or five years to learn words only, and to tack them
 together into clauses; as many more to form them into a long discourse,
 divided into four or five parts; and other five years, at least, to learn
 succinctly to mix and interweave them after a subtle and intricate manner
 let us leave all this to those who make a profession of it.

 <p>
 Going one day to Orleans, I met in that plain on this side Clery, two
 pedants who were travelling towards Bordeaux, about fifty paces distant
 from one another; and, a good way further behind them, I discovered a
 troop of horse, with a gentleman at the head of them, who was the late
 Monsieur le Comte de la Rochefoucauld. One of my people inquired of the
 foremost of these masters of arts, who that gentleman was that came after
 him; he, having not seen the train that followed after, and thinking his
 companion was meant, pleasantly answered, "He is not a gentleman; he is a
 grammarian; and I am a logician." Now we who, quite contrary, do not here
 pretend to breed a grammarian or a logician, but a gentleman, let us leave
 them to abuse their leisure; our business lies elsewhere. Let but our
 pupil be well furnished with things, words will follow but too fast; he
 will pull them after him if they do not voluntarily follow. I have
 observed some to make excuses, that they cannot express themselves, and
 pretend to have their fancies full of a great many very fine things, which
 yet, for want of eloquence, they cannot utter; 'tis a mere shift, and
 nothing else. Will you know what I think of it? I think they are nothing
 but shadows of some imperfect images and conceptions that they know not
 what to make of within, nor consequently bring out; they do not yet
 themselves understand what they would be at, and if you but observe how
 they haggle and stammer upon the point of parturition, you will soon
 conclude, that their labour is not to delivery, but about conception, and
 that they are but licking their formless embryo. For my part, I hold, and
 Socrates commands it, that whoever has in his mind a sprightly and clear
 imagination, he will express it well enough in one kind of tongue or
 another, and, if he be dumb, by signs?

 He knows nothing of ablative, conjunctive, substantive, or grammar, no
 more than his lackey, or a fishwife of the Petit Pont; and yet these will
 give you a bellyful of talk, if you will hear them, and peradventure shall
 trip as little in their language as the best masters of art in France. He
 knows no rhetoric, nor how in a preface to bribe the benevolence of the
 courteous reader; neither does he care to know it. Indeed all this fine
 decoration of painting is easily effaced by the lustre of a simple and
 blunt truth; these fine flourishes serve only to amuse the vulgar, of
 themselves incapable of more solid and nutritive diet, as Aper very
 evidently demonstrates in Tacitus. The ambassadors of Samos, prepared with
 a long and elegant oration, came to Cleomenes, king of Sparta, to incite
 him to a war against the tyrant Polycrates; who, after he had heard their
 harangue with great gravity and patience, gave them this answer: "As to
 the exordium, I remember it not, nor consequently the middle of your
 speech; and for what concerns your conclusion, I will not do what you
 desire:"?[Plutarch, Apothegms of the Lacedaemonians.]?a very
 pretty answer this, methinks, and a pack of learned orators most sweetly
 gravelled. And what did the other man say? The Athenians were to choose
 one of two architects for a very great building they had designed; of
 these, the first, a pert affected fellow, offered his service in a long
 premeditated discourse upon the subject of the work in hand, and by his
 oratory inclined the voices of the people in his favour; but the other in
 three words: "O Athenians, what this man says, I will do."?[Plutarch,
 Instructions to Statesmen, c. 4.]? When Cicero was in the height and
 heat of an eloquent harangue, many were struck with admiration; but Cato
 only laughed, saying, "We have a pleasant (mirth-making) consul." Let it
 go before, or come after, a good sentence or a thing well said, is always
 in season; if it neither suit well with what went before, nor has much
 coherence with what follows after, it is good in itself. I am none of
 those who think that good rhyme makes a good poem. Let him make short
 long, and long short if he will, 'tis no great matter; if there be
 invention, and that the wit and judgment have well performed their
 offices, I will say, here's a good poet, but an ill rhymer.

 <p>
 he will never the more lose himself for that; the very pieces will be fine
 by themselves. Menander's answer had this meaning, who being reproved by a
 friend, the time drawing on at which he had promised a comedy, that he had
 not yet fallen in hand with it; "It is made, and ready," said he, "all but
 the verses."?[Plutarch, Whether the Athenians more excelled in Arms
 or in Letters.]?Having contrived the subject, and disposed the
 scenes in his fancy, he took little care for the rest. Since Ronsard and
 Du Bellay have given reputation to our French poesy, every little dabbler,
 for aught I see, swells his words as high, and makes his cadences very
 near as harmonious as they:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Plus sonat, quam valet."

 ["More sound than sense"?Seneca, Ep., 40.]

 For the vulgar, there were never so many poetasters as now; but though
 they find it no hard matter to imitate their rhyme, they yet fall
 infinitely short of imitating the rich descriptions of the one, and the
 delicate invention of the other of these masters.

 But what will become of our young gentleman, if he be attacked with the
 sophistic subtlety of some syllogism? "A Westfalia ham makes a man drink;
 drink quenches thirst: ergo a Westfalia ham quenches thirst." Why, let him
 laugh at it; it will be more discretion to do so, than to go about to
 answer it; or let him borrow this pleasant evasion from Aristippus: "Why
 should I trouble myself to untie that, which bound as it is, gives me so
 much trouble?"?[Diogenes Laertius, ii. 70.]? One offering at
 this dialectic juggling against Cleanthes, Chrysippus took him short,
 saying, "Reserve these baubles to play with children, and do not by such
 fooleries divert the serious thoughts of a man of years." If these
 ridiculous subtleties,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Contorta et aculeata sophismata,"
</pre>
 <p>
 as Cicero calls them, are designed to possess him with an untruth, they
 are dangerous; but if they signify no more than only to make him laugh, I
 do not see why a man need to be fortified against them. There are some so
 ridiculous, as to go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aut qui non verba rebus aptant, sed res extrinsecus
 arcessunt, quibus verba conveniant."

 ["Who do not fit words to the subject, but seek out for things
 quite from the purpose to fit the words."?Quintilian, viii. 3.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And as another says,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Qui, alicujus verbi decore placentis, vocentur ad id,
 quod non proposuerant scribere."

 ["Who by their fondness of some fine sounding word, are tempted to
 something they had no intention to treat of."?Seneca, Ep., 59.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I for my part rather bring in a fine sentence by head and shoulders to fit
 my purpose, than divert my designs to hunt after a sentence. On the
 contrary, words are to serve, and to follow a man's purpose; and let
 Gascon come in play where French will not do. I would have things so
 excelling, and so wholly possessing the imagination of him that hears,
 that he should have something else to do, than to think of words. The way
 of speaking that I love, is natural and plain, the same in writing as in
 speaking, and a sinewy and muscular way of expressing a man's self, short
 and pithy, not so elegant and artificial as prompt and vehement;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Haec demum sapiet dictio, qux feriet;"

 <p>
 rather hard than wearisome; free from affectation; irregular,
 incontinuous, and bold; where every piece makes up an entire body; not
 like a pedant, a preacher, or a pleader, but rather a soldier-like style,
 as Suetonius calls that of Julius Caesar; and yet I see no reason why he
 should call it so. I have ever been ready to imitate the negligent garb,
 which is yet observable amongst the young men of our time, to wear my
 cloak on one shoulder, my cap on one side, a stocking in disorder, which
 seems to express a kind of haughty disdain of these exotic ornaments, and
 a contempt of the artificial; but I find this negligence of much better
 use in the form of speaking. All affectation, particularly in the French
 gaiety and freedom, is ungraceful in a courtier, and in a monarchy every
 gentleman ought to be fashioned according to the court model; for which
 reason, an easy and natural negligence does well. I no more like a web
 where the knots and seams are to be seen, than a fine figure, so delicate,
 that a man may tell all the bones and veins:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quae veritati operam dat oratio, incomposita sit et simplex."

 ["Let the language that is dedicated to truth be plain and
 unaffected.?Seneca, Ep. 40.]

 "Quis accurat loquitur, nisi qui vult putide loqui?"

 ["For who studies to speak accurately, that does not at the same
 time wish to perplex his auditory?"?Idem, Ep., 75.]
</pre>
 <p>
 That eloquence prejudices the subject it would advance, that wholly
 attracts us to itself. And as in our outward habit, 'tis a ridiculous
 effeminacy to distinguish ourselves by a particular and unusual garb or
 fashion; so in language, to study new phrases, and to affect words that
 are not of current use, proceeds from a puerile and scholastic ambition.
 May I be bound to speak no other language than what is spoken in the
 market-places of Paris! Aristophanes the grammarian was quite out, when he
 reprehended Epicurus for his plain way of delivering himself, and the
 design of his oratory, which was only perspicuity of speech. The imitation
 of words, by its own facility, immediately disperses itself through a
 whole people; but the imitation of inventing and fitly applying those
 words is of a slower progress. The generality of readers, for having found
 a like robe, very mistakingly imagine they have the same body and inside
 too, whereas force and sinews are never to be borrowed; the gloss, and
 outward ornament, that is, words and elocution, may. Most of those I
 converse with, speak the same language I here write; but whether they
 think the same thoughts I cannot say. The Athenians, says Plato, study
 fulness and elegancy of speaking; the Lacedaemonians affect brevity, and
 those of Crete to aim more at the fecundity of conception than the
 fertility of speech; and these are the best. Zeno used to say that he had
 two sorts of disciples, one that he called cy??-ous, curious
 to learn things, and these were his favourites; the other, aoy?-ous,
 that cared for nothing but words. Not that fine speaking is not a very
 good and commendable quality; but not so excellent and so necessary as
 some would make it; and I am scandalised that our whole life should be
 spent in nothing else. I would first understand my own language, and that
 of my neighbours, with whom most of my business and conversation lies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No doubt but Greek and Latin are very great ornaments, and of very great
 use, but we buy them too dear. I will here discover one way, which has
 been experimented in my own person, by which they are to be had better
 cheap, and such may make use of it as will. My late father having made the
 most precise inquiry that any man could possibly make amongst men of the
 greatest learning and judgment, of an exact method of education, was by
 them cautioned of this inconvenience then in use, and made to believe,
 that the tedious time we applied to the learning of the tongues of them
 who had them for nothing, was the sole cause we could not arrive to the
 grandeur of soul and perfection of knowledge, of the ancient Greeks and
 Romans. I do not, however, believe that to be the only cause. So it is,
 that the expedient my father found out for this was, that in my infancy,
 and before I began to speak, he committed me to the care of a German, who
 since died a famous physician in France, totally ignorant of our language,
 and very fluent and a great critic in Latin. This man, whom he had fetched
 out of his own country, and whom he entertained with a great salary for
 this only one end, had me continually with him; he had with him also
 joined two others, of inferior learning, to attend me, and to relieve him;
 these spoke to me in no other language but Latin. As to the rest of his
 household, it was an inviolable rule, that neither himself, nor my mother,
 nor valet, nor chambermaid, should speak anything in my company, but such
 Latin words as each one had learned to gabble with me. ?[These
 passages are, the basis of a small volume by the Abbe Mangin: "Education
 de Montaigne; ou, L'Art d'enseigner le Latin a l'instar des meres
 latines."]?It is not to be imagined how great an advantage this
 proved to the whole family; my father and my mother by this means learned
 Latin enough to understand it perfectly well, and to speak it to such a
 degree as was sufficient for any necessary use; as also those of the
 servants did who were most frequently with me. In short, we Latined it at
 such a rate, that it overflowed to all the neighbouring villages, where
 there yet remain, that have established themselves by custom, several
 Latin appellations of artisans and their tools. As for what concerns
 myself, I was above six years of age before I understood either French or
 Perigordin, any more than Arabic; and without art, book, grammar, or
 precept, whipping, or the expense of a tear, I had, by that time, learned
 to speak as pure Latin as my master himself, for I had no means of mixing
 it up with any other. If, for example, they were to give me a theme after
 the college fashion, they gave it to others in French; but to me they were
 to give it in bad Latin, to turn it into that which was good. And Nicolas
 Grouchy, who wrote a book De Comitiis Romanorum; Guillaume Guerente, who
 wrote a comment upon Aristotle: George Buchanan, that great Scottish poet:
 and Marc Antoine Muret (whom both France and Italy have acknowledged for
 the best orator of his time), my domestic tutors, have all of them often
 told me that I had in my infancy that language so very fluent and ready,
 that they were afraid to enter into discourse with me. And particularly
 Buchanan, whom I since saw attending the late Mareschal de Brissac, then
 told me, that he was about to write a treatise of education, the example
 of which he intended to take from mine; for he was then tutor to that
 Comte de Brissac who afterward proved so valiant and so brave a gentleman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As to Greek, of which I have but a mere smattering, my father also
 designed to have it taught me by a device, but a new one, and by way of
 sport; tossing our declensions to and fro, after the manner of those who,
 by certain games of tables, learn geometry and arithmetic. For he, amongst
 other rules, had been advised to make me relish science and duty by an
 unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion, and to educate my soul in
 all liberty and delight, without any severity or constraint; which he was
 an observer of to such a degree, even of superstition, if I may say so,
 that some being of opinion that it troubles and disturbs the brains of
 children suddenly to wake them in the morning, and to snatch them
 violently?and over-hastily from sleep (wherein they are much more
 profoundly involved than we), he caused me to be wakened by the sound of
 some musical instrument, and was never unprovided of a musician for that
 purpose. By this example you may judge of the rest, this alone being
 sufficient to recommend both the prudence and the affection of so good a
 father, who is not to be blamed if he did not reap fruits answerable to so
 exquisite a culture. Of this, two things were the cause: first, a sterile
 and improper soil; for, though I was of a strong and healthful
 constitution, and of a disposition tolerably sweet and tractable, yet I
 was, withal, so heavy, idle, and indisposed, that they could not rouse me
 from my sloth, not even to get me out to play. What I saw, I saw clearly
 enough, and under this heavy complexion nourished a bold imagination and
 opinions above my age. I had a slow wit that would go no faster than it
 was led; a tardy understanding, a languishing invention, and above all,
 incredible defect of memory; so that, it is no wonder, if from all these
 nothing considerable could be extracted. Secondly, like those who,
 impatient of along and steady cure, submit to all sorts of prescriptions
 and recipes, the good man being extremely timorous of any way failing in a
 thing he had so wholly set his heart upon, suffered himself at last to be
 overruled by the common opinions, which always follow their leader as a
 flight of cranes, and complying with the method of the time, having no
 more those persons he had brought out of Italy, and who had given him the
 first model of education, about him, he sent me at six years of age to the
 College of Guienne, at that time the best and most flourishing in France.
 And there it was not possible to add anything to the care he had to
 provide me the most able tutors, with all other circumstances of
 education, reserving also several particular rules contrary to the college
 practice; but so it was, that with all these precautions, it was a college
 still. My Latin immediately grew corrupt, of which also by discontinuance
 I have since lost all manner of use; so that this new way of education
 served me to no other end, than only at my first coming to prefer me to
 the first forms; for at thirteen years old, that I came out of the
 college, I had run through my whole course (as they call it), and, in
 truth, without any manner of advantage, that I can honestly brag of, in
 all this time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first taste which I had for books came to me from the pleasure in
 reading the fables of Ovid's Metamorphoses; for, being about seven or
 eight years old, I gave up all other diversions to read them, both by
 reason that this was my own natural language, the easiest book that I was
 acquainted with, and for the subject, the most accommodated to the
 capacity of my age: for as for the Lancelot of the Lake, the Amadis of
 Gaul, the Huon of Bordeaux, and such farragos, by which children are most
 delighted with, I had never so much as heard their names, no more than I
 yet know what they contain; so exact was the discipline wherein I was
 brought up. But this was enough to make me neglect the other lessons that
 were prescribed me; and here it was infinitely to my advantage, to have to
 do with an understanding tutor, who very well knew discreetly to connive
 at this and other truantries of the same nature; for by this means I ran
 through Virgil's AEneid, and then Terence, and then Plautus, and then some
 Italian comedies, allured by the sweetness of the subject; whereas had he
 been so foolish as to have taken me off this diversion, I do really
 believe, I had brought away nothing from the college but a hatred of
 books, as almost all our young gentlemen do. But he carried himself very
 discreetly in that business, seeming to take no notice, and allowing me
 only such time as I could steal from my other regular studies, which
 whetted my appetite to devour those books. For the chief things my father
 expected from their endeavours to whom he had delivered me for education,
 were affability and good-humour; and, to say the truth, my manners had no
 other vice but sloth and want of metal. The fear was not that I should do
 ill, but that I should do nothing; nobody prognosticated that I should be
 wicked, but only useless; they foresaw idleness, but no malice; and I find
 it falls out accordingly: The complaints I hear of myself are these: "He
 is idle, cold in the offices of friendship and relation, and in those of
 the public, too particular, too disdainful." But the most injurious do not
 say, "Why has he taken such a thing? Why has he not paid such an one?"
 but, "Why does he part with nothing? Why does he not give?" And I should
 take it for a favour that men would expect from me no greater effects of
 supererogation than these. But they are unjust to exact from me what I do
 not owe, far more rigorously than they require from others that which they
 do owe. In condemning me to it, they efface the gratification of the
 action, and deprive me of the gratitude that would be my due for it;
 whereas the active well-doing ought to be of so much the greater value
 from my hands, by how much I have never been passive that way at all. I
 can the more freely dispose of my fortune the more it is mine, and of
 myself the more I am my own. Nevertheless, if I were good at setting out
 my own actions, I could, peradventure, very well repel these reproaches,
 and could give some to understand, that they are not so much offended,
 that I do not enough, as that I am able to do a great deal more than I do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet for all this heavy disposition of mine, my mind, when retired into
 itself, was not altogether without strong movements, solid and clear
 judgments about those objects it could comprehend, and could also, without
 any helps, digest them; but, amongst other things, I do really believe, it
 had been totally impossible to have made it to submit by violence and
 force. Shall I here acquaint you with one faculty of my youth? I had great
 assurance of countenance, and flexibility of voice and gesture, in
 applying myself to any part I undertook to act: for before?

 I played the chief parts in the Latin tragedies of Buchanan, Guerente, and
 Muret, that were presented in our College of Guienne with great dignity:
 now Andreas Goveanus, our principal, as in all other parts of his charge,
 was, without comparison, the best of that employment in France; and I was
 looked upon as one of the best actors. 'Tis an exercise that I do not
 disapprove in young people of condition; and I have since seen our
 princes, after the example of some of the ancients, in person handsomely
 and commendably perform these exercises; it was even allowed to persons of
 quality to make a profession of it in Greece.

 <p>
 Nay, I have always taxed those with impertinence who condemn these
 entertainments, and with injustice those who refuse to admit such
 comedians as are worth seeing into our good towns, and grudge the people
 that public diversion. Well-governed corporations take care to assemble
 their citizens, not only to the solemn duties of devotion, but also to
 sports and spectacles. They find society and friendship augmented by it;
 and besides, can there possibly be allowed a more orderly and regular
 diversion than what is performed m the sight of every one, and very often
 in the presence of the supreme magistrate himself? And I, for my part,
 should think it reasonable, that the prince should sometimes gratify his
 people at his own expense, out of paternal goodness and affection; and
 that in populous cities there should be theatres erected for such
 entertainments, if but to divert them from worse and private actions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To return to my subject, there is nothing like alluring the appetite and
 affections; otherwise you make nothing but so many asses laden with books;
 by dint of the lash, you give them their pocketful of learning to keep;
 whereas, to do well you should not only lodge it with them, but make them
 espouse it.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXVI??THAT IT IS FOLLY TO MEASURE TRUTH AND ERROR BY
 OUR OWN CAPACITY
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Tis not, perhaps, without reason, that we attribute facility of belief
 and easiness of persuasion to simplicity and ignorance: for I fancy I have
 heard belief compared to the impression of a seal upon the soul, which by
 how much softer and of less resistance it is, is the more easy to be
 impressed upon.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ut necesse est, lancem in Libra, ponderibus impositis,
 deprimi, sic animum perspicuis cedere."

 ["As the scale of the balance must give way to the weight that
 presses it down, so the mind yields to demonstration."
 ?Cicero, Acad., ii. 12.]
</pre>
 <p>
 By how much the soul is more empty and without counterpoise, with so much
 greater facility it yields under the weight of the first persuasion. And
 this is the reason that children, the common people, women, and sick
 folks, are most apt to be led by the ears. But then, on the other hand,
 'tis a foolish presumption to slight and condemn all things for false that
 do not appear to us probable; which is the ordinary vice of such as fancy
 themselves wiser than their neighbours. I was myself once one of those;
 and if I heard talk of dead folks walking, of prophecies, enchantments,
 witchcrafts, or any other story I had no mind to believe:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,
 Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala,"

 ["Dreams, magic terrors, marvels, sorceries, Thessalian prodigies."
 ?Horace. Ep. ii. 3, 208.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I presently pitied the poor people that were abused by these follies.
 Whereas I now find, that I myself was to be pitied as much, at least, as
 they; not that experience has taught me anything to alter my former
 opinions, though my curiosity has endeavoured that way; but reason has
 instructed me, that thus resolutely to condemn anything for false and
 impossible, is arrogantly and impiously to circumscribe and limit the will
 of God, and the power of our mother nature, within the bounds of my own
 capacity, than which no folly can be greater. If we give the names of
 monster and miracle to everything our reason cannot comprehend, how many
 are continually presented before our eyes? Let us but consider through
 what clouds, and as it were groping in the dark, our teachers lead us to
 the knowledge of most of the things about us; assuredly we shall find that
 it is rather custom than knowledge that takes away their strangeness?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Jam nemo, fessus saturusque videndi,
 Suspicere in coeli dignatur lucida templa;"

 ["Weary of the sight, now no one deigns to look up to heaven's lucid
 temples."?Lucretius, ii. 1037. The text has 'statiate videnai']
</pre>
 <p>
 and that if those things were now newly presented to us, we should think
 them as incredible, if not more, than any others.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si nunc primum mortalibus adsint
 Ex improviso, si sint objecta repente,
 Nil magis his rebus poterat mirabile dici,
 Aute minus ante quod auderent fore credere gentes."

 [Lucretius, ii. 1032. The sense of the passage is in the preceding
 sentence.]
</pre>
 <p>
 He that had never seen a river, imagined the first he met with to be the
 sea; and the greatest things that have fallen within our knowledge, we
 conclude the extremes that nature makes of the kind.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Scilicet et fluvius qui non est maximus, ei'st
 Qui non ante aliquem majorem vidit; et ingens
 Arbor, homoque videtur, et omnia de genere omni
 Maxima quae vidit quisque, haec ingentia fingit."

 ["A little river seems to him, who has never seen a larger river, a
 mighty stream; and so with other things?a tree, a man?anything
 appears greatest to him that never knew a greater."?Idem, vi. 674.]

 "Consuetudine oculorum assuescunt animi, neque admirantur,
 neque requirunt rationes earum rerum, quas semper vident."

 ["Things grow familiar to men's minds by being often seen; so that
 they neither admire nor are they inquisitive about things they daily
 see."?Cicero, De Natura Deor., lib. ii. 38.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The novelty, rather than the greatness of things, tempts us to inquire
 into their causes. We are to judge with more reverence, and with greater
 acknowledgment of our own ignorance and infirmity, of the infinite power
 of nature. How many unlikely things are there testified by people worthy
 of faith, which, if we cannot persuade ourselves absolutely to believe, we
 ought at least to leave them in suspense; for, to condemn them as
 impossible, is by a temerarious presumption to pretend to know the utmost
 bounds of possibility. Did we rightly understand the difference betwixt
 the impossible and the unusual, and betwixt that which is contrary to the
 order and course of nature and contrary to the common opinion of men, in
 not believing rashly, and on the other hand, in not being too incredulous,
 we should observe the rule of 'Ne quid nimis' enjoined by Chilo.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we find in Froissart, that the Comte de Foix knew in Bearn the defeat
 of John, king of Castile, at Jubera the next day after it happened, and
 the means by which he tells us he came to do so, we may be allowed to be a
 little merry at it, as also at what our annals report, that Pope Honorius,
 the same day that King Philip Augustus died at Mantes, performed his
 public obsequies at Rome, and commanded the like throughout Italy, the
 testimony of these authors not being, perhaps, of authority enough to
 restrain us. But what if Plutarch, besides several examples that he
 produces out of antiquity, tells us, he knows of certain knowledge, that
 in the time of Domitian, the news of the battle lost by Antony in Germany
 was published at Rome, many days' journey from thence, and dispersed
 throughout the whole world, the same day it was fought; and if Caesar was
 of opinion, that it has often happened, that the report has preceded the
 incident, shall we not say, that these simple people have suffered
 themselves to be deceived with the vulgar, for not having been so
 clear-sighted as we? Is there anything more delicate, more clear, more
 sprightly; than Pliny's judgment, when he is pleased to set it to work?
 Anything more remote from vanity? Setting aside his learning, of which I
 make less account, in which of these excellences do any of us excel him?
 And yet there is scarce a young schoolboy that does not convict him of
 untruth, and that pretends not to instruct him in the progress of the
 works of nature. When we read in Bouchet the miracles of St. Hilary's
 relics, away with them: his authority is not sufficient to deprive us of
 the liberty of contradicting him; but generally and offhand to condemn all
 suchlike stories, seems to me a singular impudence. That great St.
 Augustin' testifies to have seen a blind child recover sight upon the
 relics of St. Gervasius and St. Protasius at Milan; a woman at Carthage
 cured of a cancer, by the sign of the cross made upon her by a woman newly
 baptized; Hesperius, a familiar friend of his, to have driven away the
 spirits that haunted his house, with a little earth of the sepulchre of
 our Lord; which earth, being also transported thence into the church, a
 paralytic to have there been suddenly cured by it; a woman in a
 procession, having touched St. Stephen's shrine with a nosegay, and
 rubbing her eyes with it, to have recovered her sight, lost many years
 before; with several other miracles of which he professes himself to have
 been an eyewitness: of what shall we excuse him and the two holy bishops,
 Aurelius and Maximinus, both of whom he attests to the truth of these
 things? Shall it be of ignorance, simplicity, and facility; or of malice
 and imposture? Is any man now living so impudent as to think himself
 comparable to them in virtue, piety, learning, judgment, or any kind of
 perfection?

 <p>
 'Tis a presumption of great danger and consequence, besides the absurd
 temerity it draws after it, to contemn what we do not comprehend. For
 after, according to your fine understanding, you have established the
 limits of truth and error, and that, afterwards, there appears a necessity
 upon you of believing stranger things than those you have contradicted,
 you are already obliged to quit your limits. Now, that which seems to me
 so much to disorder our consciences in the commotions we are now in
 concerning religion, is the Catholics dispensing so much with their
 belief. They fancy they appear moderate, and wise, when they grant to
 their opponents some of the articles in question; but, besides that they
 do not discern what advantage it is to those with whom we contend, to
 begin to give ground and to retire, and how much this animates our enemy
 to follow his blow: these articles which they select as things
 indifferent, are sometimes of very great importance. We are either wholly
 and absolutely to submit ourselves to the authority of our ecclesiastical
 polity, or totally throw off all obedience to it: 'tis not for us to
 determine what and how much obedience we owe to it. And this I can say, as
 having myself made trial of it, that having formerly taken the liberty of
 my own swing and fancy, and omitted or neglected certain rules of the
 discipline of our Church, which seemed to me vain and strange coming
 afterwards to discourse of it with learned men, I have found those same
 things to be built upon very good and solid ground and strong foundation;
 and that nothing but stupidity and ignorance makes us receive them with
 less reverence than the rest. Why do we not consider what contradictions
 we find in our own judgments; how many things were yesterday articles of
 our faith, that to-day appear no other than fables? Glory and curiosity
 are the scourges of the soul; the last prompts us to thrust our noses into
 everything, the other forbids us to leave anything doubtful and undecided.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXVII??OF FRIENDSHIP
 </h2>
 <p>
 Having considered the proceedings of a painter that serves me, I had a
 mind to imitate his way. He chooses the fairest place and middle of any
 wall, or panel, wherein to draw a picture, which he finishes with his
 utmost care and art, and the vacuity about it he fills with grotesques,
 which are odd fantastic figures without any grace but what they derive
 from their variety, and the extravagance of their shapes. And in truth,
 what are these things I scribble, other than grotesques and monstrous
 bodies, made of various parts, without any certain figure, or any other
 than accidental order, coherence, or proportion?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne."

 ["A fair woman in her upper form terminates in a fish."
 ?Horace, De Arte Poetica, v. 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 In this second part I go hand in hand with my painter; but fall very short
 of him in the first and the better, my power of handling not being such,
 that I dare to offer at a rich piece, finely polished, and set off
 according to art. I have therefore thought fit to borrow one of Estienne
 de la Boetie, and such a one as shall honour and adorn all the rest of my
 work?namely, a discourse that he called 'Voluntary Servitude'; but,
 since, those who did not know him have properly enough called it "Le contr
 Un." He wrote in his youth,?["Not being as yet eighteen years old."?Edition
 of 1588.] by way of essay, in honour of liberty against tyrants; and it
 has since run through the hands of men of great learning and judgment, not
 without singular and merited commendation; for it is finely written, and
 as full as anything can possibly be. And yet one may confidently say it is
 far short of what he was able to do; and if in that more mature age,
 wherein I had the happiness to know him, he had taken a design like this
 of mine, to commit his thoughts to writing, we should have seen a great
 many rare things, and such as would have gone very near to have rivalled
 the best writings of antiquity: for in natural parts especially, I know no
 man comparable to him. But he has left nothing behind him, save this
 treatise only (and that too by chance, for I believe he never saw it after
 it first went out of his hands), and some observations upon that edict of
 January?[1562, which granted to the Huguenots the public exercise of
 their religion.]?made famous by our civil-wars, which also shall
 elsewhere, peradventure, find a place. These were all I could recover of
 his remains, I to whom with so affectionate a remembrance, upon his
 death-bed, he by his last will bequeathed his library and papers, the
 little book of his works only excepted, which I committed to the press.
 And this particular obligation I have to this treatise of his, that it was
 the occasion of my first coming acquainted with him; for it was showed to
 me long before I had the good fortune to know him; and the first knowledge
 of his name, proving the first cause and foundation of a friendship, which
 we afterwards improved and maintained, so long as God was pleased to
 continue us together, so perfect, inviolate, and entire, that certainly
 the like is hardly to be found in story, and amongst the men of this age,
 there is no sign nor trace of any such thing in use; so much concurrence
 is required to the building of such a one, that 'tis much, if fortune
 bring it but once to pass in three ages.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There is nothing to which nature seems so much to have inclined us, as to
 society; and Aristotle , says that the good legislators had more respect
 to friendship than to justice. Now the most supreme point of its
 perfection is this: for, generally, all those that pleasure, profit,
 public or private interest create and nourish, are so much the less
 beautiful and generous, and so much the less friendships, by how much they
 mix another cause, and design, and fruit in friendship, than itself.
 Neither do the four ancient kinds, natural, social, hospitable, venereal,
 either separately or jointly, make up a true and perfect friendship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That of children to parents is rather respect: friendship is nourished by
 communication, which cannot by reason of the great disparity, be betwixt
 these, but would rather perhaps offend the duties of nature; for neither
 are all the secret thoughts of fathers fit to be communicated to children,
 lest it beget an indecent familiarity betwixt them; nor can the advices
 and reproofs, which is one of the principal offices of friendship, be
 properly performed by the son to the father. There are some countries
 where 'twas the custom for children to kill their fathers; and others,
 where the fathers killed their children, to avoid their being an
 impediment one to another in life; and naturally the expectations of the
 one depend upon the ruin of the other. There have been great philosophers
 who have made nothing of this tie of nature, as Aristippus for one, who
 being pressed home about the affection he owed to his children, as being
 come out of him, presently fell to spit, saying, that this also came out
 of him, and that we also breed worms and lice; and that other, that
 Plutarch endeavoured to reconcile to his brother: "I make never the more
 account of him," said he, "for coming out of the same hole." This name of
 brother does indeed carry with it a fine and delectable sound, and for
 that reason, he and I called one another brothers but the complication of
 interests, the division of estates, and that the wealth of the one should
 be the property of the other, strangely relax and weaken the fraternal
 tie: brothers pursuing their fortune and advancement by the same path,
 'tis hardly possible but they must of necessity often jostle and hinder
 one another. Besides, why is it necessary that the correspondence of
 manners, parts, and inclinations, which begets the true and perfect
 friendships, should always meet in these relations? The father and the son
 may be of quite contrary humours, and so of brothers: he is my son, he is
 my brother; but he is passionate, ill-natured, or a fool. And moreover, by
 how much these are friendships that the law and natural obligation impose
 upon us, so much less is there of our own choice and voluntary freedom;
 whereas that voluntary liberty of ours has no production more promptly
 and; properly its own than affection and friendship. Not that I have not
 in my own person experimented all that can possibly be expected of that
 kind, having had the best and most indulgent father, even to his extreme
 old age, that ever was, and who was himself descended from a family for
 many generations famous and exemplary for brotherly concord:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et ipse
 Notus in fratres animi paterni."

 ["And I myself, known for paternal love toward my brothers."
 ?Horace, Ode, ii. 2, 6.]
</pre>
 <p>
 We are not here to bring the love we bear to women, though it be an act of
 our own choice, into comparison, nor rank it with the others. The fire of
 this, I confess,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Neque enim est dea nescia nostri
 Qux dulcem curis miscet amaritiem,"

 ["Nor is the goddess unknown to me who mixes a sweet bitterness
 with my love."?-Catullus, lxviii. 17.]
</pre>
 <p>
 is more active, more eager, and more sharp: but withal, 'tis more
 precipitant, fickle, moving, and inconstant; a fever subject to
 intermissions and paroxysms, that has seized but on one part of us.
 Whereas in friendship, 'tis a general and universal fire, but temperate
 and equal, a constant established heat, all gentle and smooth, without
 poignancy or roughness. Moreover, in love, 'tis no other than frantic
 desire for that which flies from us:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Come segue la lepre il cacciatore
 Al freddo, al caldo, alla montagna, al lito;
 Ne piu l'estima poi the presa vede;
 E sol dietro a chi fugge affretta il piede"

 ["As the hunter pursues the hare, in cold and heat, to the mountain,
 to the shore, nor cares for it farther when he sees it taken, and
 only delights in chasing that which flees from him."?Aristo, x. 7.]
</pre>
 <p>
 so soon as it enters unto the terms of friendship, that is to say, into a
 concurrence of desires, it vanishes and is gone, fruition destroys it, as
 having only a fleshly end, and such a one as is subject to satiety.
 Friendship, on the contrary, is enjoyed proportionably as it is desired;
 and only grows up, is nourished and improved by enjoyment, as being of
 itself spiritual, and the soul growing still more refined by practice.
 Under this perfect friendship, the other fleeting affections have in my
 younger years found some place in me, to say nothing of him, who himself
 so confesses but too much in his verses; so that I had both these
 passions, but always so, that I could myself well enough distinguish them,
 and never in any degree of comparison with one another; the first
 maintaining its flight in so lofty and so brave a place, as with disdain
 to look down, and see the other flying at a far humbler pitch below.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As concerning marriage, besides that it is a covenant, the entrance into
 which only is free, but the continuance in it forced and compulsory,
 having another dependence than that of our own free will, and a bargain
 commonly contracted to other ends, there almost always happens a thousand
 intricacies in it to unravel, enough to break the thread and to divert the
 current of a lively affection: whereas friendship has no manner of
 business or traffic with aught but itself. Moreover, to say truth, the
 ordinary talent of women is not such as is sufficient to maintain the
 conference and communication required to the support of this sacred tie;
 nor do they appear to be endued with constancy of mind, to sustain the
 pinch of so hard and durable a knot. And doubtless, if without this, there
 could be such a free and voluntary familiarity contracted, where not only
 the souls might have this entire fruition, but the bodies also might share
 in the alliance, and a man be engaged throughout, the friendship would
 certainly be more full and perfect; but it is without example that this
 sex has ever yet arrived at such perfection; and, by the common consent of
 the ancient schools, it is wholly rejected from it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That other Grecian licence is justly abhorred by our manners, which also,
 from having, according to their practice, a so necessary disparity of age
 and difference of offices betwixt the lovers, answered no more to the
 perfect union and harmony that we here require than the other:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quis est enim iste amor amicitiae? cur neque deformem
 adolescentem quisquam amat, neque formosum senem?"

 ["For what is that friendly love? why does no one love a deformed
 youth or a comely old man?"?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iv. 33.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Neither will that very picture that the Academy presents of it, as I
 conceive, contradict me, when I say, that this first fury inspired by the
 son of Venus into the heart of the lover, upon sight of the flower and
 prime of a springing and blossoming youth, to which they allow all the
 insolent and passionate efforts that an immoderate ardour can produce, was
 simply founded upon external beauty, the false image of corporal
 generation; for it could not ground this love upon the soul, the sight of
 which as yet lay concealed, was but now springing, and not of maturity to
 blossom; that this fury, if it seized upon a low spirit, the means by
 which it preferred its suit were rich presents, favour in advancement to
 dignities, and such trumpery, which they by no means approve; if on a more
 generous soul, the pursuit was suitably generous, by philosophical
 instructions, precepts to revere religion, to obey the laws, to die for
 the good of one's country; by examples of valour, prudence, and justice,
 the lover studying to render himself acceptable by the grace and beauty of
 the soul, that of his body being long since faded and decayed, hoping by
 this mental society to establish a more firm and lasting contract. When
 this courtship came to effect in due season (for that which they do not
 require in the lover, namely, leisure and discretion in his pursuit, they
 strictly require in the person loved, forasmuch as he is to judge of an
 internal beauty, of difficult knowledge and abstruse discovery), then
 there sprung in the person loved the desire of a spiritual conception; by
 the mediation of a spiritual beauty. This was the principal; the
 corporeal, an accidental and secondary matter; quite the contrary as to
 the lover. For this reason they prefer the person beloved, maintaining
 that the gods in like manner preferred him too, and very much blame the
 poet AEschylus for having, in the loves of Achilles and Patroclus, given
 the lover's part to Achilles, who was in the first and beardless flower of
 his adolescence, and the handsomest of all the Greeks. After this general
 community, the sovereign, and most worthy part presiding and governing,
 and performing its proper offices, they say, that thence great utility was
 derived, both by private and public concerns; that it constituted the
 force and power of the countries where it prevailed, and the chiefest
 security of liberty and justice. Of which the healthy loves of Harmodius
 and Aristogiton are instances. And therefore it is that they called it
 sacred and divine, and conceive that nothing but the violence of tyrants
 and the baseness of the common people are inimical to it. Finally, all
 that can be said in favour of the Academy is, that it was a love which
 ended in friendship, which well enough agrees with the Stoical definition
 of love:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Amorem conatum esse amicitiae faciendae
 ex pulchritudinis specie."

 ["Love is a desire of contracting friendship arising from the beauty
 of the object."?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., vi. 34.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I return to my own more just and true description:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Omnino amicitiae, corroboratis jam confirmatisque,
 et ingeniis, et aetatibus, judicandae sunt."

 ["Those are only to be reputed friendships that are fortified and
 confirmed by judgement and the length of time."
 ?Cicero, De Amicit., c. 20.]
</pre>
 <p>
 For the rest, what we commonly call friends and friendships, are nothing
 but acquaintance and familiarities, either occasionally contracted, or
 upon some design, by means of which there happens some little intercourse
 betwixt our souls. But in the friendship I speak of, they mix and work
 themselves into one piece, with so universal a mixture, that there is no
 more sign of the seam by which they were first conjoined. If a man should
 importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no
 otherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because
 it was I. There is, beyond all that I am able to say, I know not what
 inexplicable and fated power that brought on this union. We sought one
 another long before we met, and by the characters we heard of one another,
 which wrought upon our affections more than, in reason, mere reports
 should do; I think 'twas by some secret appointment of heaven. We embraced
 in our names; and at our first meeting, which was accidentally at a great
 city entertainment, we found ourselves so mutually taken with one another,
 so acquainted, and so endeared betwixt ourselves, that from thenceforward
 nothing was so near to us as one another. He wrote an excellent Latin
 satire, since printed, wherein he excuses the precipitation of our
 intelligence, so suddenly come to perfection, saying, that destined to
 have so short a continuance, as begun so late (for we were both full-grown
 men, and he some years the older), there was no time to lose, nor were we
 tied to conform to the example of those slow and regular friendships, that
 require so many precautions of long preliminary conversation: This has no
 other idea than that of itself, and can only refer to itself: this is no
 one special consideration, nor two, nor three, nor four, nor a thousand;
 'tis I know not what quintessence of all this mixture, which, seizing my
 whole will, carried it to plunge and lose itself in his, and that having
 seized his whole will, brought it back with equal concurrence and appetite
 to plunge and lose itself in mine. I may truly say lose, reserving nothing
 to ourselves that was either his or mine.?[All this relates to
 Estienne de la Boetie.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Laelius,?[Cicero, De Amicit., c. II.]?in the presence of
 the Roman consuls, who after thay had sentenced Tiberius Gracchus,
 prosecuted all those who had had any familiarity with him also; came to
 ask Caius Blosius, who was his chiefest friend, how much he would have
 done for him, and that he made answer: "All things."?"How! All
 things!" said Laelius. "And what if he had commanded you to fire our
 temples?"?"He would never have commanded me that," replied Blosius.?"But
 what if he had?" said Laelius.?"I would have obeyed him," said the
 other. If he was so perfect a friend to Gracchus as the histories report
 him to have been, there was yet no necessity of offending the consuls by
 such a bold confession, though he might still have retained the assurance
 he had of Gracchus' disposition. However, those who accuse this answer as
 seditious, do not well understand the mystery; nor presuppose, as it was
 true, that he had Gracchus' will in his sleeve, both by the power of a
 friend, and the perfect knowledge he had of the man: they were more
 friends than citizens, more friends to one another than either enemies or
 friends to their country, or than friends to ambition and innovation;
 having absolutely given up themselves to one another, either held
 absolutely the reins of the other's inclination; and suppose all this
 guided by virtue, and all this by the conduct of reason, which also
 without these it had not been possible to do, Blosius' answer was such as
 it ought to be. If any of their actions flew out of the handle, they were
 neither (according to my measure of friendship) friends to one another,
 nor to themselves. As to the rest, this answer carries no worse sound,
 than mine would do to one that should ask me: "If your will should command
 you to kill your daughter, would you do it?" and that I should make
 answer, that I would; for this expresses no consent to such an act,
 forasmuch as I do not in the least suspect my own will, and as little that
 of such a friend. 'Tis not in the power of all the eloquence in the world,
 to dispossess me of the certainty I have of the intentions and resolutions
 of my friend; nay, no one action of his, what face soever it might bear,
 could be presented to me, of which I could not presently, and at first
 sight, find out the moving cause. Our souls had drawn so unanimously
 together, they had considered each other with so ardent an affection, and
 with the like affection laid open the very bottom of our hearts to one
 another's view, that I not only knew his as well as my own; but should
 certainly in any concern of mine have trusted my interest much more
 willingly with him, than with myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let no one, therefore, rank other common friendships with such a one as
 this. I have had as much experience of these as another, and of the most
 perfect of their kind: but I do not advise that any should confound the
 rules of the one and the other, for they would find themselves much
 deceived. In those other ordinary friendships, you are to walk with bridle
 in your hand, with prudence and circumspection, for in them the knot is
 not so sure that a man may not half suspect it will slip. "Love him," said
 Chilo,?[Aulus Gellius, i. 3.]?"so as if you were one day to
 hate him; and hate him so as you were one day to love him." This precept,
 though abominable in the sovereign and perfect friendship I speak of, is
 nevertheless very sound as to the practice of the ordinary and customary
 ones, and to which the saying that Aristotle had so frequent in his mouth,
 "O my friends, there is no friend," may very fitly be applied. In this
 noble commerce, good offices, presents, and benefits, by which other
 friendships are supported and maintained, do not deserve so much as to be
 mentioned; and the reason is the concurrence of our wills; for, as the
 kindness I have for myself receives no increase, for anything I relieve
 myself withal in time of need (whatever the Stoics say), and as I do not
 find myself obliged to myself for any service I do myself: so the union of
 such friends, being truly perfect, deprives them of all idea of such
 duties, and makes them loathe and banish from their conversation these
 words of division and distinction, benefits, obligation, acknowledgment,
 entreaty, thanks, and the like. All things, wills, thoughts, opinions,
 goods, wives, children, honours, and lives, being in effect common betwixt
 them, and that absolute concurrence of affections being no other than one
 soul in two bodies (according to that very proper definition of
 Aristotle), they can neither lend nor give anything to one another. This
 is the reason why the lawgivers, to honour marriage with some resemblance
 of this divine alliance, interdict all gifts betwixt man and wife;
 inferring by that, that all should belong to each of them, and that they
 have nothing to divide or to give to each other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If, in the friendship of which I speak, one could give to the other, the
 receiver of the benefit would be the man that obliged his friend; for each
 of them contending and above all things studying how to be useful to the
 other, he that administers the occasion is the liberal man, in giving his
 friend the satisfaction of doing that towards him which above all things
 he most desires. When the philosopher Diogenes wanted money, he used to
 say, that he redemanded it of his friends, not that he demanded it. And to
 let you see the practical working of this, I will here produce an ancient
 and singular example. Eudamidas, a Corinthian, had two friends, Charixenus
 a Sicyonian and Areteus a Corinthian; this man coming to die, being poor,
 and his two friends rich, he made his will after this manner. "I bequeath
 to Areteus the maintenance of my mother, to support and provide for her in
 her old age; and to Charixenus I bequeath the care of marrying my
 daughter, and to give her as good a portion as he is able; and in case one
 of these chance to die, I hereby substitute the survivor in his place."
 They who first saw this will made themselves very merry at the contents:
 but the legatees, being made acquainted with it, accepted it with very
 great content; and one of them, Charixenus, dying within five days after,
 and by that means the charge of both duties devolving solely on him,
 Areteus nurtured the old woman with very great care and tenderness, and of
 five talents he had in estate, he gave two and a half in marriage with an
 only daughter he had of his own, and two and a half in marriage with the
 daughter of Eudamidas, and on one and the same day solemnised both their
 nuptials.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This example is very full, if one thing were not to be objected, namely
 the multitude of friends for the perfect friendship I speak of is
 indivisible; each one gives himself so entirely to his friend, that he has
 nothing left to distribute to others: on the contrary, is sorry that he is
 not double, treble, or quadruple, and that he has not many souls and many
 wills, to confer them all upon this one object. Common friendships will
 admit of division; one may love the beauty of this person, the good-humour
 of that, the liberality of a third, the paternal affection of a fourth,
 the fraternal love of a fifth, and so of the rest: but this friendship
 that possesses the whole soul, and there rules and sways with an absolute
 sovereignty, cannot possibly admit of a rival. If two at the same time
 should call to you for succour, to which of them would you run? Should
 they require of you contrary offices, how could you serve them both?
 Should one commit a thing to your silence that it were of importance to
 the other to know, how would you disengage yourself? A unique and
 particular friendship dissolves all other obligations whatsoever: the
 secret I have sworn not to reveal to any other, I may without perjury
 communicate to him who is not another, but myself. 'Tis miracle enough
 certainly, for a man to double himself, and those that talk of tripling,
 talk they know not of what. Nothing is extreme, that has its like; and he
 who shall suppose, that of two, I love one as much as the other, that they
 mutually love one another too, and love me as much as I love them,
 multiplies into a confraternity the most single of units, and whereof,
 moreover, one alone is the hardest thing in the world to find. The rest of
 this story suits very well with what I was saying; for Eudamidas, as a
 bounty and favour, bequeaths to his friends a legacy of employing
 themselves in his necessity; he leaves them heirs to this liberality of
 his, which consists in giving them the opportunity of conferring a benefit
 upon him; and doubtless, the force of friendship is more eminently
 apparent in this act of his, than in that of Areteus. In short, these are
 effects not to be imagined nor comprehended by such as have not experience
 of them, and which make me infinitely honour and admire the answer of that
 young soldier to Cyrus, by whom being asked how much he would take for a
 horse, with which he had won the prize of a race, and whether he would
 exchange him for a kingdom? ?"No, truly, sir," said he, "but I would
 give him with all my heart, to get thereby a true friend, could I find out
 any man worthy of that alliance."?[Xenophon, Cyropadia, viii. 3.]?He
 did not say ill in saying, "could I find": for though one may almost
 everywhere meet with men sufficiently qualified for a superficial
 acquaintance, yet in this, where a man is to deal from the very bottom of
 his heart, without any manner of reservation, it will be requisite that
 all the wards and springs be truly wrought and perfectly sure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In confederations that hold but by one end, we are only to provide against
 the imperfections that particularly concern that end. It can be of no
 importance to me of what religion my physician or my lawyer is; this
 consideration has nothing in common with the offices of friendship which
 they owe me; and I am of the same indifference in the domestic
 acquaintance my servants must necessarily contract with me. I never
 inquire, when I am to take a footman, if he be chaste, but if he be
 diligent; and am not solicitous if my muleteer be given to gaming, as if
 he be strong and able; or if my cook be a swearer, if he be a good cook. I
 do not take upon me to direct what other men should do in the government
 of their families, there are plenty that meddle enough with that, but only
 give an account of my method in my own:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Mihi sic usus est: tibi, ut opus est facto, face."

 ["This has been my way; as for you, do as you find needful.
 ?"Terence, Heaut., i. I., 28.]
</pre>
 <p>
 For table-talk, I prefer the pleasant and witty before the learned and the
 grave; in bed, beauty before goodness; in common discourse the ablest
 speaker, whether or no there be sincerity in the case. And, as he that was
 found astride upon a hobby-horse, playing with his children, entreated the
 person who had surprised him in that posture to say nothing of it till
 himself came to be a father,?[Plutarch, Life of Agesilaus, c. 9.]?supposing
 that the fondness that would then possess his own soul, would render him a
 fairer judge of such an action; so I, also, could wish to speak to such as
 have had experience of what I say: though, knowing how remote a thing such
 a friendship is from the common practice, and how rarely it is to be
 found, I despair of meeting with any such judge. For even these discourses
 left us by antiquity upon this subject, seem to me flat and poor, in
 comparison of the sense I have of it, and in this particular, the effects
 surpass even the precepts of philosophy.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico."

 ["While I have sense left to me, there will never be anything more
 acceptable to me than an agreeable friend."
 ?Horace, Sat., i. 5, 44.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The ancient Menander declared him to be happy that had had the good
 fortune to meet with but the shadow of a friend: and doubtless he had good
 reason to say so, especially if he spoke by experience: for in good
 earnest, if I compare all the rest of my life, though, thanks be to God, I
 have passed my time pleasantly enough, and at my ease, and the loss of
 such a friend excepted, free from any grievous affliction, and in great
 tranquillity of mind, having been contented with my natural and original
 commodities, without being solicitous after others; if I should compare it
 all, I say, with the four years I had the happiness to enjoy the sweet
 society of this excellent man, 'tis nothing but smoke, an obscure and
 tedious night. From the day that I lost him:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quern semper acerbum,
 Semper honoratum (sic, di, voluistis) habebo,"

 ["A day for me ever sad, for ever sacred, so have you willed ye
 gods."?AEneid, v. 49.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I have only led a languishing life; and the very pleasures that present
 themselves to me, instead of administering anything of consolation, double
 my affliction for his loss. We were halves throughout, and to that degree,
 that methinks, by outliving him, I defraud him of his part.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nec fas esse ulla me voluptate hic frui
 Decrevi, tantisper dum ille abest meus particeps."

 ["I have determined that it will never be right for me to enjoy any
 pleasure, so long as he, with whom I shared all pleasures is away."
 ?Terence, Heaut., i. I. 97.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I was so grown and accustomed to be always his double in all places and in
 all things, that methinks I am no more than half of myself:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Illam meae si partem anima tulit
 Maturior vis, quid moror altera?
 Nec carus aeque, nec superstes
 Integer? Ille dies utramque
 Duxit ruinam."

 ["If that half of my soul were snatch away from me by an untimely
 stroke, why should the other stay? That which remains will not be
 equally dear, will not be whole: the same day will involve the
 destruction of both."]

 or:

 ["If a superior force has taken that part of my soul, why do I, the
 remaining one, linger behind? What is left is not so dear, nor an
 entire thing: this day has wrought the destruction of both."
 ?Horace, Ode, ii. 17, 5.]
</pre>
 <p>
 There is no action or imagination of mine wherein I do not miss him; as I
 know that he would have missed me: for as he surpassed me by infinite
 degrees in virtue and all other accomplishments, so he also did in the
 duties of friendship:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quis desiderio sit pudor, aut modus
 Tam cari capitis?"

 ["What shame can there, or measure, in lamenting so dear a friend?"
 ?Horace, Ode, i. 24, I.]

 "O misero frater adempte mihi!
 Omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
 Quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor.
 Tu mea, tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater;
 Tecum una tota est nostra sepulta anima
 Cujus ego interitu tota de menthe fugavi
 Haec studia, atque omnes delicias animi.
 Alloquar? audiero nunquam tua verba loquentem?
 Nunquam ego te, vita frater amabilior
 Aspiciam posthac; at certe semper amabo;"

 ["O brother, taken from me miserable! with thee, all our joys have
 vanished, those joys which, in thy life, thy dear love nourished.
 Dying, thou, my brother, hast destroyed all my happiness. My whole
 soul is buried with thee. Through whose death I have banished from
 my mind these studies, and all the delights of the mind. Shall I
 address thee? I shall never hear thy voice. Never shall I behold
 thee hereafter. O brother, dearer to me than life. Nought remains,
 but assuredly I shall ever love thee."?Catullus, lxviii. 20; lxv.]

 But let us hear a boy of sixteen speak:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ?[In Cotton's translation the work referred to is "those Memoirs
 upon the famous edict of January," of which mention has already been
 made in the present edition. The edition of 1580, however, and the
 Variorum edition of 1872-1900, indicate no particular work; but the
 edition of 1580 has it "this boy of eighteen years" (which was the
 age at which La Boetie wrote his "Servitude Volontaire"), speaks of
 "a boy of sixteen" as occurring only in the common editions, and it
 would seem tolerably clear that this more important work was, in
 fact, the production to which Montaigne refers, and that the proper
 reading of the text should be "sixteen years." What "this boy
 spoke" is not given by Montaigne, for the reason stated in the next
 following paragraph.]
</pre>
 <p>
 "Because I have found that that work has been since brought out, and with
 a mischievous design, by those who aim at disturbing and changing the
 condition of our government, without troubling themselves to think whether
 they are likely to improve it: and because they have mixed up his work
 with some of their own performance, I have refrained from inserting it
 here. But that the memory of the author may not be injured, nor suffer
 with such as could not come near-hand to be acquainted with his
 principles, I here give them to understand, that it was written by him in
 his boyhood, and that by way of exercise only, as a common theme that has
 been hackneyed by a thousand writers. I make no question but that he
 himself believed what he wrote, being so conscientious that he would not
 so much as lie in jest: and I moreover know, that could it have been in
 his own choice, he had rather have been born at Venice, than at Sarlac;
 and with reason. But he had another maxim sovereignty imprinted in his
 soul, very religiously to obey and submit to the laws under which he was
 born. There never was a better citizen, more affectionate to his country;
 nor a greater enemy to all the commotions and innovations of his time: so
 that he would much rather have employed his talent to the extinguishing of
 those civil flames, than have added any fuel to them; he had a mind
 fashioned to the model of better ages. Now, in exchange of this serious
 piece, I will present you with another of a more gay and frolic air, from
 the same hand, and written at the same age."

 CHAPTER XXIX??OF MODERATION
 </h2>
 <p>
 As if we had an infectious touch, we, by our manner of handling, corrupt
 things that in themselves are laudable and good: we may grasp virtue so
 that it becomes vicious, if we embrace it too stringently and with too
 violent a desire. Those who say, there is never any excess in virtue,
 forasmuch as it is not virtue when it once becomes excess, only play upon
 words:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,
 Ultra quam satis est, virtutem si petat ipsam."

 ["Let the wise man bear the name of a madman, the just one of an
 unjust, if he seek wisdom more than is sufficient."
 ?Horace, Ep., i. 6, 15.]

 ["The wise man is no longer wise, the just man no longer just, if he
 seek to carry his love for wisdom or virtue beyond that which is
 necessary."]
</pre>
 <p>
 This is a subtle consideration of philosophy. A man may both be too much
 in love with virtue, and be excessive in a just action. Holy Writ agrees
 with this, Be not wiser than you should, but be soberly wise.?[St.
 Paul, Epistle to the Romans, xii. 3.]?I have known a great man,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ?["It is likely that Montaigne meant Henry III., king of France.
 The Cardinal d'Ossat, writing to Louise, the queen-dowager, told
 her, in his frank manner, that he had lived as much or more like a
 monk than a monarch (Letter XXIII.) And Pope Sextus V., speaking of
 that prince one day to the Cardinal de Joyeuse, protector of the
 affairs of France, said to him pleasantly, 'There is nothing that
 your king hath not done, and does not do so still, to be a monk, nor
 anything that I have not done, not to be a monk.'"?Coste.]

 beyond all examples of others of his condition. I love temperate and
 moderate natures. An immoderate zeal, even to that which is good, even
 though it does not offend, astonishes me, and puts me to study what name
 to give it. Neither the mother of Pausanias,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ?["Montaigne would here give us to understand, upon the authority of
 Diodorus Siculus, that Pausanias' mother gave the first hint of the
 punishment that was to be inflicted on her son. 'Pausanias,' says
 this historian, 'perceiving that the ephori, and some other
 Lacedoemonians, aimed at apprehending him, got the start of them,
 and went and took sanctuary m Minerva's temple: and the
 Lacedaemonians, being doubtful whether they ought to take him from
 thence in violation of the franchise there, it is said that his own
 mother came herself to the temple but spoke nothing nor did anything
 more than lay a piece of brick, which she brought with her, on the
 threshold of the temple, which, when she had done, she returned
 home. The Lacedaemonians, taking the hint from the mother, caused
 the gate of the temple to be walled up, and by this means starved
 Pausanias, so that he died with hunger, &amp;c. (lib. xi. cap. 10., of
 Amyot's translation). The name of Pausanias' mother was Alcithea,
 as we are informed by Thucydides' scholiast, who only says that it
 was reported, that when they set about walling up the gates of the
 chapel in which Pausanias had taken refuge, his mother Alcithea laid
 the first stone."?Coste.]

 <p>
 who was the first instructor of her son's process, and threw the first
 stone towards his death, nor Posthumius the dictator, who put his son to
 death, whom the ardour of youth had successfully pushed upon the enemy a
 little more advanced than the rest of his squadron, do appear to me so
 much just as strange; and I should neither advise nor like to follow so
 savage a virtue, and that costs so dear.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ?["Opinions differ as to the truth of this fact. Livy thinks he
 has good authority for rejecting it because it does not appear in
 history that Posthumious was branded with it, as Titus Manlius was,
 about 100 years after his time; for Manlius, having put his son to
 death for the like cause, obtained the odious name of Imperiosus,
 and since that time Manliana imperia has been used as a term to
 signify orders that are too severe; Manliana Imperia, says Livy,
 were not only horrible for the time present, but of a bad example to
 posterity. And this historian makes no doubt but such commands
 would have been actually styled Posthumiana Imperia, if Posthumius
 had been the first who set so barbarous an example (Livy, lib. iv.
 cap. 29, and lib. viii. cap. 7). But, however, Montaigne has Valer.
 Maximus on his side, who says expressly, that Posthumius caused his
 son to be put to death, and Diodorus of Sicily (lib. xii. cap.
 19)."?Coste.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The archer that shoots over, misses as much as he that falls short, and
 'tis equally troublesome to my sight, to look up at a great light, and to
 look down into a dark abyss. Callicles in Plato says, that the extremity
 of philosophy is hurtful, and advises not to dive into it beyond the
 limits of profit; that, taken moderately, it is pleasant and useful; but
 that in the end it renders a man brutish and vicious, a contemner of
 religion and the common laws, an enemy to civil conversation, and all
 human pleasures, incapable of all public administration, unfit either to
 assist others or to relieve himself, and a fit object for all sorts of
 injuries and affronts. He says true; for in its excess, it enslaves our
 natural freedom, and by an impertinent subtlety, leads us out of the fair
 and beaten way that nature has traced for us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The love we bear to our wives is very lawful, and yet theology thinks fit
 to curb and restrain it. As I remember, I have read in one place of St.
 Thomas Aquinas,?[Secunda Secundx, Quaest. 154, art. 9.]?where
 he condemns marriages within any of the forbidden degrees, for this
 reason, amongst others, that there is some danger, lest the friendship a
 man bears to such a woman, should be immoderate; for if the conjugal
 affection be full and perfect betwixt them, as it ought to be, and that it
 be over and above surcharged with that of kindred too, there is no doubt,
 but such an addition will carry the husband beyond the bounds of reason.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those sciences that regulate the manners of men, divinity and philosophy,
 will have their say in everything; there is no action so private and
 secret that can escape their inspection and jurisdiction. They are best
 taught who are best able to control and curb their own liberty; women
 expose their nudities as much as you will upon the account of pleasure,
 though in the necessities of physic they are altogether as shy. I will,
 therefore, in their behalf:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ?[Coste translates this: "on the part of philosophy and theology,"
 observing that but few wives would think themselves obliged to
 Montaigne for any such lesson to their husbands.]?
</pre>
 <p>
 teach the husbands, that is, such as are too vehement in the exercise of
 the matrimonial duty?if such there still be?this lesson, that
 the very pleasures they enjoy in the society of their wives are
 reproachable if immoderate, and that a licentious and riotous abuse of
 them is a fault as reprovable here as in illicit connections. Those
 immodest and debauched tricks and postures, that the first ardour suggests
 to us in this affair, are not only indecently but detrimentally practised
 upon our wives. Let them at least learn impudence from another hand; they
 are ever ready enough for our business, and I for my part always went the
 plain way to work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Marriage is a solemn and religious tie, and therefore the pleasure we
 extract from it should be a sober and serious delight, and mixed with a
 certain kind of gravity; it should be a sort of discreet and conscientious
 pleasure. And seeing that the chief end of it is generation, some make a
 question, whether when men are out of hopes as when they are superannuated
 or already with child, it be lawful to embrace our wives. 'Tis homicide,
 according to Plato.?[Laws, 8.]? Certain nations (the
 Mohammedan, amongst others) abominate all conjunction with women with
 child, others also, with those who are in their courses. Zenobia would
 never admit her husband for more than one encounter, after which she left
 him to his own swing for the whole time of her conception, and not till
 after that would again receive him:?[Trebellius Pollio, Triginta
 Tyran., c. 30.]?a brave and generous example of conjugal continence.
 It was doubtless from some lascivious poet,?[The lascivious poet is
 Homer; see his Iliad, xiv. 294.]?and one that himself was in great
 distress for a little of this sport, that Plato borrowed this story; that
 Jupiter was one day so hot upon his wife, that not having so much patience
 as till she could get to the couch, he threw her upon the floor, where the
 vehemence of pleasure made him forget the great and important resolutions
 he had but newly taken with the rest of the gods in his celestial council,
 and to brag that he had had as good a bout, as when he got her maidenhead,
 unknown to their parents.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The kings of Persia were wont to invite their wives to the beginning of
 their festivals; but when the wine began to work in good earnest, and that
 they were to give the reins to pleasure, they sent them back to their
 private apartments, that they might not participate in their immoderate
 lust, sending for other women in their stead, with whom they were not
 obliged to so great a decorum of respect.?[Plutarch, Precepts of
 Marriage, c. 14.]?All pleasures and all sorts of gratifications are
 not properly and fitly conferred upon all sorts of persons. Epaminondas
 had committed to prison a young man for certain debauches; for whom
 Pelopidas mediated, that at his request he might be set at liberty, which
 Epaminondas denied to him, but granted it at the first word to a wench of
 his, that made the same intercession; saying, that it was a gratification
 fit for such a one as she, but not for a captain. Sophocles being joint
 praetor with Pericles, seeing accidentally a fine boy pass by: "O what a
 charming boy is that!" said he. "That might be very well," answered
 Pericles, "for any other than a praetor, who ought not only to have his
 hands, but his eyes, too, chaste."?[Cicero, De Offic., i. 40.]
 AElius Verus, the emperor, answered his wife, who reproached him with his
 love to other women, that he did it upon a conscientious account,
 forasmuch as marriage was a name of honour and dignity, not of wanton and
 lascivious desire; and our ecclesiastical history preserves the memory of
 that woman in great veneration, who parted from her husband because she
 would not comply with his indecent and inordinate desires. In fine, there
 is no pleasure so just and lawful, where intemperance and excess are not
 to be condemned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, to speak the truth, is not man a most miserable creature the while?
 It is scarce, by his natural condition, in his power to taste one pleasure
 pure and entire; and yet must he be contriving doctrines and precepts to
 curtail that little he has; he is not yet wretched enough, unless by art
 and study he augment his own misery:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Fortunae miseras auximus arte vias."

 ["We artificially augment the wretchedness of fortune."
 ?Properitius, lib. iii. 7, 44.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Human wisdom makes as ill use of her talent, when she exercises it in
 rescinding from the number and sweetness of those pleasures that are
 naturally our due, as she employs it favourably and well in artificially
 disguising and tricking out the ills of life, to alleviate the sense of
 them. Had I ruled the roast, I should have taken another and more natural
 course, which, to say the truth, is both commodious and holy, and should,
 peradventure, have been able to have limited it too; notwithstanding that
 both our spiritual and corporal physicians, as by compact betwixt
 themselves, can find no other way to cure, nor other remedy for the
 infirmities of the body and the soul, than by misery and pain. To this
 end, watchings, fastings, hair-shirts, remote and solitary banishments,
 perpetual imprisonments, whips and other afflictions, have been introduced
 amongst men: but so, that they should carry a sting with them, and be real
 afflictions indeed; and not fall out as it once did to one Gallio, who
 having been sent an exile into the isle of Lesbos, news was not long after
 brought to Rome, that he there lived as merry as the day was long; and
 that what had been enjoined him for a penance, turned to his pleasure and
 satisfaction: whereupon the Senate thought fit to recall him home to his
 wife and family, and confine him to his own house, to accommodate their
 punishment to his feeling and apprehension. For to him whom fasting would
 make more healthful and more sprightly, and to him to whose palate fish
 were more acceptable than flesh, the prescription of these would have no
 curative effect; no more than in the other sort of physic, where drugs
 have no effect upon him who swallows them with appetite and pleasure: the
 bitterness of the potion and the abhorrence of the patient are necessary
 circumstances to the operation. The nature that would eat rhubarb like
 buttered turnips, would frustrate the use and virtue of it; it must be
 something to trouble and disturb the stomach, that must purge and cure it;
 and here the common rule, that things are cured by their contraries,
 fails; for in this one ill is cured by another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This belief a little resembles that other so ancient one, of thinking to
 gratify the gods and nature by massacre and murder: an opinion universally
 once received in all religions. And still, in these later times wherein
 our fathers lived, Amurath at the taking of the Isthmus, immolated six
 hundred young Greeks to his father's soul, in the nature of a propitiatory
 sacrifice for his sins. And in those new countries discovered in this age
 of ours, which are pure and virgin yet, in comparison of ours, this
 practice is in some measure everywhere received: all their idols reek with
 human blood, not without various examples of horrid cruelty: some they
 burn alive, and take, half broiled, off the coals to tear out their hearts
 and entrails; some, even women, they flay alive, and with their bloody
 skins clothe and disguise others. Neither are we without great examples of
 constancy and resolution in this affair the poor souls that are to be
 sacrificed, old men, women, and children, themselves going about some days
 before to beg alms for the offering of their sacrifice, presenting
 themselves to the slaughter, singing and dancing with the spectators.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ambassadors of the king of Mexico, setting out to Fernando Cortez the
 power and greatness of their master, after having told him, that he had
 thirty vassals, of whom each was able to raise an hundred thousand
 fighting men, and that he kept his court in the fairest and best fortified
 city under the sun, added at last, that he was obliged yearly to offer to
 the gods fifty thousand men. And it is affirmed, that he maintained a
 continual war, with some potent neighbouring nations, not only to keep the
 young men in exercise, but principally to have wherewithal to furnish his
 sacrifices with his prisoners of war. At a certain town in another place,
 for the welcome of the said Cortez, they sacrificed fifty men at once. I
 will tell you this one tale more, and I have done; some of these people
 being beaten by him, sent to acknowledge him, and to treat with him of a
 peace, whose messengers carried him three sorts of gifts, which they
 presented in these terms: "Behold, lord, here are five slaves: if thou art
 a furious god that feedeth upon flesh and blood, eat these, and we will
 bring thee more; if thou art an affable god, behold here incense and
 feathers; but if thou art a man, take these fowls and these fruits that we
 have brought thee."

 CHAPTER XXX??OF CANNIBALS
 </h2>
 <p>
 When King Pyrrhus invaded Italy, having viewed and considered the order of
 the army the Romans sent out to meet him; "I know not," said he, "what
 kind of barbarians" (for so the Greeks called all other nations) "these
 may be; but the disposition of this army that I see has nothing of
 barbarism in it."?[Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, c. 8.]?As much
 said the Greeks of that which Flaminius brought into their country; and
 Philip, beholding from an eminence the order and distribution of the Roman
 camp formed in his kingdom by Publius Sulpicius Galba, spake to the same
 effect. By which it appears how cautious men ought to be of taking things
 upon trust from vulgar opinion, and that we are to judge by the eye of
 reason, and not from common report.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I long had a man in my house that lived ten or twelve years in the New
 World, discovered in these latter days, and in that part of it where
 Villegaignon landed,?[At Brazil, in 1557.]?which he called
 Antarctic France. This discovery of so vast a country seems to be of very
 great consideration. I cannot be sure, that hereafter there may not be
 another, so many wiser men than we having been deceived in this. I am
 afraid our eyes are bigger than our bellies, and that we have more
 curiosity than capacity; for we grasp at all, but catch nothing but wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plato brings in Solon,?[In Timaeus.]?telling a story that he
 had heard from the priests of Sais in Egypt, that of old, and before the
 Deluge, there was a great island called Atlantis, situate directly at the
 mouth of the straits of Gibraltar, which contained more countries than
 both Africa and Asia put together; and that the kings of that country, who
 not only possessed that Isle, but extended their dominion so far into the
 continent that they had a country of Africa as far as Egypt, and extending
 in Europe to Tuscany, attempted to encroach even upon Asia, and to
 subjugate all the nations that border upon the Mediterranean Sea, as far
 as the Black Sea; and to that effect overran all Spain, the Gauls, and
 Italy, so far as to penetrate into Greece, where the Athenians stopped
 them: but that some time after, both the Athenians, and they and their
 island, were swallowed by the Flood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is very likely that this extreme irruption and inundation of water made
 wonderful changes and alterations in the habitations of the earth, as 'tis
 said that the sea then divided Sicily from Italy?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Haec loca, vi quondam et vasta convulsa ruina,
 Dissiluisse ferunt, quum protenus utraque tellus
 Una foret"

 ["These lands, they say, formerly with violence and vast desolation
 convulsed, burst asunder, where erewhile were."?AEneid, iii. 414.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Cyprus from Syria, the isle of Negropont from the continent of Beeotia,
 and elsewhere united lands that were separate before, by filling up the
 channel betwixt them with sand and mud:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sterilisque diu palus, aptaque remis,
 Vicinas urbes alit, et grave sentit aratrum."

 ["That which was once a sterile marsh, and bore vessels on its
 bosom, now feeds neighbouring cities, and admits the plough."
 ?Horace, De Arte Poetica, v. 65.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But there is no great appearance that this isle was this New World so
 lately discovered: for that almost touched upon Spain, and it were an
 incredible effect of an inundation, to have tumbled back so prodigious a
 mass, above twelve hundred leagues: besides that our modern navigators
 have already almost discovered it to be no island, but terra firma, and
 continent with the East Indies on the one side, and with the lands under
 the two poles on the other side; or, if it be separate from them, it is by
 so narrow a strait and channel, that it none the more deserves the name of
 an island for that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It should seem, that in this great body, there are two sorts of motions,
 the one natural and the other febrific, as there are in ours. When I
 consider the impression that our river of Dordogne has made in my time on
 the right bank of its descent, and that in twenty years it has gained so
 much, and undermined the foundations of so many houses, I perceive it to
 be an extraordinary agitation: for had it always followed this course, or
 were hereafter to do it, the aspect of the world would be totally changed.
 But rivers alter their course, sometimes beating against the one side, and
 sometimes the other, and some times quietly keeping the channel. I do not
 speak of sudden inundations, the causes of which everybody understands. In
 Medoc, by the seashore, the Sieur d'Arsac, my brother, sees an estate he
 had there, buried under the sands which the sea vomits before it: where
 the tops of some houses are yet to be seen, and where his rents and
 domains are converted into pitiful barren pasturage. The inhabitants of
 this place affirm, that of late years the sea has driven so vehemently
 upon them, that they have lost above four leagues of land. These sands are
 her harbingers: and we now see great heaps of moving sand, that march half
 a league before her, and occupy the land.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other testimony from antiquity, to which some would apply this
 discovery of the New World, is in Aristotle; at least, if that little book
 of Unheard of Miracles be his?[one of the spurious publications
 brought out under his name?D.W.]. He there tells us, that certain
 Carthaginians, having crossed the Atlantic Sea without the Straits of
 Gibraltar, and sailed a very long time, discovered at last a great and
 fruitful island, all covered over with wood, and watered with several
 broad and deep rivers, far remote from all terra firma; and that they, and
 others after them, allured by the goodness and fertility of the soil, went
 thither with their wives and children, and began to plant a colony. But
 the senate of Carthage perceiving their people by little and little to
 diminish, issued out an express prohibition, that none, upon pain of
 death, should transport themselves thither; and also drove out these new
 inhabitants; fearing, 'tis said, lest' in process of time they should so
 multiply as to supplant themselves and ruin their state. But this relation
 of Aristotle no more agrees with our new-found lands than the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This man that I had was a plain ignorant fellow, and therefore the more
 likely to tell truth: for your better-bred sort of men are much more
 curious in their observation, 'tis true, and discover a great deal more;
 but then they gloss upon it, and to give the greater weight to what they
 deliver, and allure your belief, they cannot forbear a little to alter the
 story; they never represent things to you simply as they are, but rather
 as they appeared to them, or as they would have them appear to you, and to
 gain the reputation of men of judgment, and the better to induce your
 faith, are willing to help out the business with something more than is
 really true, of their own invention. Now in this case, we should either
 have a man of irreproachable veracity, or so simple that he has not
 wherewithal to contrive, and to give a colour of truth to false relations,
 and who can have no ends in forging an untruth. Such a one was mine; and
 besides, he has at divers times brought to me several seamen and merchants
 who at the same time went the same voyage. I shall therefore content
 myself with his information, without inquiring what the cosmographers say
 to the business. We should have topographers to trace out to us the
 particular places where they have been; but for having had this advantage
 over us, to have seen the Holy Land, they would have the privilege,
 forsooth, to tell us stories of all the other parts of the world beside. I
 would have every one write what he knows, and as much as he knows, but no
 more; and that not in this only but in all other subjects; for such a
 person may have some particular knowledge and experience of the nature of
 such a river, or such a fountain, who, as to other things, knows no more
 than what everybody does, and yet to give a currency to his little
 pittance of learning, will undertake to write the whole body of physics: a
 vice from which great inconveniences derive their original.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, to return to my subject, I find that there is nothing barbarous and
 savage in this nation, by anything that I can gather, excepting, that
 every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use in
 his own country. As, indeed, we have no other level of truth and reason
 than the example and idea of the opinions and customs of the place wherein
 we live: there is always the perfect religion, there the perfect
 government, there the most exact and accomplished usage of all things.
 They are savages at the same rate that we say fruits are wild, which
 nature produces of herself and by her own ordinary progress; whereas, in
 truth, we ought rather to call those wild whose natures we have changed by
 our artifice and diverted from the common order. In those, the genuine,
 most useful, and natural virtues and properties are vigorous and
 sprightly, which we have helped to degenerate in these, by accommodating
 them to the pleasure of our own corrupted palate. And yet for all this,
 our taste confesses a flavour and delicacy excellent even to emulation of
 the best of ours, in several fruits wherein those countries abound without
 art or culture. Neither is it reasonable that art should gain the
 pre-eminence of our great and powerful mother nature. We have so
 surcharged her with the additional ornaments and graces we have added to
 the beauty and riches of her own works by our inventions, that we have
 almost smothered her; yet in other places, where she shines in her own
 purity and proper lustre, she marvellously baffles and disgraces all our
 vain and frivolous attempts:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et veniunt hederae sponte sua melius;
 Surgit et in solis formosior arbutus antris;
 Et volucres nulls dulcius arte canunt."

 ["The ivy grows best spontaneously, the arbutus best in shady caves;
 and the wild notes of birds are sweeter than art can teach.
 ?"Propertius, i. 2, 10.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Our utmost endeavours cannot arrive at so much as to imitate the nest of
 the least of birds, its contexture, beauty, and convenience: not so much
 as the web of a poor spider.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All things, says Plato,?[Laws, 10.]?are produced either by
 nature, by fortune, or by art; the greatest and most beautiful by the one
 or the other of the former, the least and the most imperfect by the last.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received
 but very little form and fashion from art and human invention, and
 consequently to be not much remote from their original simplicity. The
 laws of nature, however, govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with
 any mixture of ours: but 'tis in such purity, that I am sometimes troubled
 we were not sooner acquainted with these people, and that they were not
 discovered in those better times, when there were men much more able to
 judge of them than we are. I am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato had no
 knowledge of them; for to my apprehension, what we now see in those
 nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the poets have
 adorned the golden age, and all their inventions in feigning a happy state
 of man, but, moreover, the fancy and even the wish and desire of
 philosophy itself; so native and so pure a simplicity, as we by experience
 see to be in them, could never enter into their imagination, nor could
 they ever believe that human society could have been maintained with so
 little artifice and human patchwork. I should tell Plato that it is a
 nation wherein there is no manner of traffic, no knowledge of letters, no
 science of numbers, no name of magistrate or political superiority; no use
 of service, riches or poverty, no contracts, no successions, no dividends,
 no properties, no employments, but those of leisure, no respect of
 kindred, but common, no clothing, no agriculture, no metal, no use of corn
 or wine; the very words that signify lying, treachery, dissimulation,
 avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard of.

 <p>
 As to the rest, they live in a country very pleasant and temperate, so
 that, as my witnesses inform me, 'tis rare to hear of a sick person, and
 they moreover assure me, that they never saw any of the natives, either
 paralytic, bleareyed, toothless, or crooked with age. The situation of
 their country is along the sea-shore, enclosed on the other side towards
 the land, with great and high mountains, having about a hundred leagues in
 breadth between. They have great store of fish and flesh, that have no
 resemblance to those of ours: which they eat without any other cookery,
 than plain boiling, roasting, and broiling. The first that rode a horse
 thither, though in several other voyages he had contracted an acquaintance
 and familiarity with them, put them into so terrible a fright, with his
 centaur appearance, that they killed him with their arrows before they
 could come to discover who he was. Their buildings are very long, and of
 capacity to hold two or three hundred people, made of the barks of tall
 trees, reared with one end upon the ground, and leaning to and supporting
 one another at the top, like some of our barns, of which the covering
 hangs down to the very ground, and serves for the side walls. They have
 wood so hard, that they cut with it, and make their swords of it, and
 their grills of it to broil their meat. Their beds are of cotton, hung
 swinging from the roof, like our seamen's hammocks, every man his own, for
 the wives lie apart from their husbands. They rise with the sun, and so
 soon as they are up, eat for all day, for they have no more meals but
 that; they do not then drink, as Suidas reports of some other people of
 the East that never drank at their meals; but drink very often all day
 after, and sometimes to a rousing pitch. Their drink is made of a certain
 root, and is of the colour of our claret, and they never drink it but
 lukewarm. It will not keep above two or three days; it has a somewhat
 sharp, brisk taste, is nothing heady, but very comfortable to the stomach;
 laxative to strangers, but a very pleasant beverage to such as are
 accustomed to it. They make use, instead of bread, of a certain white
 compound, like coriander seeds; I have tasted of it; the taste is sweet
 and a little flat. The whole day is spent in dancing. Their young men go
 a-hunting after wild beasts with bows and arrows; one part of their women
 are employed in preparing their drink the while, which is their chief
 employment. One of their old men, in the morning before they fall to
 eating, preaches to the whole family, walking from the one end of the
 house to the other, and several times repeating the same sentence, till he
 has finished the round, for their houses are at least a hundred yards
 long. Valour towards their enemies and love towards their wives, are the
 two heads of his discourse, never failing in the close, to put them in
 mind, that 'tis their wives who provide them their drink warm and well
 seasoned. The fashion of their beds, ropes, swords, and of the wooden
 bracelets they tie about their wrists, when they go to fight, and of the
 great canes, bored hollow at one end, by the sound of which they keep the
 cadence of their dances, are to be seen in several places, and amongst
 others, at my house. They shave all over, and much more neatly than we,
 without other razor than one of wood or stone. They believe in the
 immortality of the soul, and that those who have merited well of the gods
 are lodged in that part of heaven where the sun rises, and the accursed in
 the west.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They have I know not what kind of priests and prophets, who very rarely
 present themselves to the people, having their abode in the mountains. At
 their arrival, there is a great feast, and solemn assembly of many
 villages: each house, as I have described, makes a village, and they are
 about a French league distant from one another. This prophet declaims to
 them in public, exhorting them to virtue and their duty: but all their
 ethics are comprised in these two articles, resolution in war, and
 affection to their wives. He also prophesies to them events to come, and
 the issues they are to expect from their enterprises, and prompts them to
 or diverts them from war: but let him look to't; for if he fail in his
 divination, and anything happen otherwise than he has foretold, he is cut
 into a thousand pieces, if he be caught, and condemned for a false
 prophet: for that reason, if any of them has been mistaken, he is no more
 heard of.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Divination is a gift of God, and therefore to abuse it, ought to be a
 punishable imposture. Amongst the Scythians, where their diviners failed
 in the promised effect, they were laid, bound hand and foot, upon carts
 loaded with firs and bavins, and drawn by oxen, on which they were burned
 to death.?[Herodotus, iv. 69.]?Such as only meddle with things
 subject to the conduct of human capacity, are excusable in doing the best
 they can: but those other fellows that come to delude us with assurances
 of an extraordinary faculty, beyond our understanding, ought they not to
 be punished, when they do not make good the effect of their promise, and
 for the temerity of their imposture?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They have continual war with the nations that live further within the
 mainland, beyond their mountains, to which they go naked, and without
 other arms than their bows and wooden swords, fashioned at one end like
 the head of our javelins. The obstinacy of their battles is wonderful, and
 they never end without great effusion of blood: for as to running away,
 they know not what it is. Every one for a trophy brings home the head of
 an enemy he has killed, which he fixes over the door of his house. After
 having a long time treated their prisoners very well, and given them all
 the regales they can think of, he to whom the prisoner belongs, invites a
 great assembly of his friends. They being come, he ties a rope to one of
 the arms of the prisoner, of which, at a distance, out of his reach, he
 holds the one end himself, and gives to the friend he loves best the other
 arm to hold after the same manner; which being. done, they two, in the
 presence of all the assembly, despatch him with their swords. After that,
 they roast him, eat him amongst them, and send some chops to their absent
 friends. They do not do this, as some think, for nourishment, as the
 Scythians anciently did, but as a representation of an extreme revenge; as
 will appear by this: that having observed the Portuguese, who were in
 league with their enemies, to inflict another sort of death upon any of
 them they took prisoners, which was to set them up to the girdle in the
 earth, to shoot at the remaining part till it was stuck full of arrows,
 and then to hang them, they thought those people of the other world (as
 being men who had sown the knowledge of a great many vices amongst their
 neighbours, and who were much greater masters in all sorts of mischief
 than they) did not exercise this sort of revenge without a meaning, and
 that it must needs be more painful than theirs, they began to leave their
 old way, and to follow this. I am not sorry that we should here take
 notice of the barbarous horror of so cruel an action, but that, seeing so
 clearly into their faults, we should be so blind to our own. I conceive
 there is more barbarity in eating a man alive, than when he is dead; in
 tearing a body limb from limb by racks and torments, that is yet in
 perfect sense; in roasting it by degrees; in causing it to be bitten and
 worried by dogs and swine (as we have not only read, but lately seen, not
 amongst inveterate and mortal enemies, but among neighbours and
 fellow-citizens, and, which is worse, under colour of piety and religion),
 than to roast and eat him after he is dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chrysippus and Zeno, the two heads of the Stoic sect, were of opinion that
 there was no hurt in making use of our dead carcasses, in what way soever
 for our necessity, and in feeding upon them too;?[Diogenes Laertius,
 vii. 188.]?as our own ancestors, who being besieged by Caesar in the
 city Alexia, resolved to sustain the famine of the siege with the bodies
 of their old men, women, and other persons who were incapable of bearing
 arms.

 <p>
 And the physicians make no bones of employing it to all sorts of use,
 either to apply it outwardly; or to give it inwardly for the health of the
 patient. But there never was any opinion so irregular, as to excuse
 treachery, disloyalty, tyranny, and cruelty, which are our familiar vices.
 We may then call these people barbarous, in respect to the rules of
 reason: but not in respect to ourselves, who in all sorts of barbarity
 exceed them. Their wars are throughout noble and generous, and carry as
 much excuse and fair pretence, as that human malady is capable of; having
 with them no other foundation than the sole jealousy of valour. Their
 disputes are not for the conquest of new lands, for these they already
 possess are so fruitful by nature, as to supply them without labour or
 concern, with all things necessary, in such abundance that they have no
 need to enlarge their borders. And they are, moreover, happy in this, that
 they only covet so much as their natural necessities require: all beyond
 that is superfluous to them: men of the same age call one another
 generally brothers, those who are younger, children; and the old men are
 fathers to all. These leave to their heirs in common the full possession
 of goods, without any manner of division, or other title than what nature
 bestows upon her creatures, in bringing them into the world. If their
 neighbours pass over the mountains to assault them, and obtain a victory,
 all the victors gain by it is glory only, and the advantage of having
 proved themselves the better in valour and virtue: for they never meddle
 with the goods of the conquered, but presently return into their own
 country, where they have no want of anything necessary, nor of this
 greatest of all goods, to know happily how to enjoy their condition and to
 be content. And those in turn do the same; they demand of their prisoners
 no other ransom, than acknowledgment that they are overcome: but there is
 not one found in an age, who will not rather choose to die than make such
 a confession, or either by word or look recede from the entire grandeur of
 an invincible courage. There is not a man amongst them who had not rather
 be killed and eaten, than so much as to open his mouth to entreat he may
 not. They use them with all liberality and freedom, to the end their lives
 may be so much the dearer to them; but frequently entertain them with
 menaces of their approaching death, of the torments they are to suffer, of
 the preparations making in order to it, of the mangling their limbs, and
 of the feast that is to be made, where their carcass is to be the only
 dish. All which they do, to no other end, but only to extort some gentle
 or submissive word from them, or to frighten them so as to make them run
 away, to obtain this advantage that they were terrified, and that their
 constancy was shaken; and indeed, if rightly taken, it is in this point
 only that a true victory consists:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Victoria nulla est,
 Quam quae confessor animo quoque subjugat hostes."

 ["No victory is complete, which the conquered do not admit to be

</pre>
 <p>
 The Hungarians, a very warlike people, never pretend further than to
 reduce the enemy to their discretion; for having forced this confession
 from them, they let them go without injury or ransom, excepting, at the
 most, to make them engage their word never to bear arms against them
 again. We have sufficient advantages over our enemies that are borrowed
 and not truly our own; it is the quality of a porter, and no effect of
 virtue, to have stronger arms and legs; it is a dead and corporeal quality
 to set in array; 'tis a turn of fortune to make our enemy stumble, or to
 dazzle him with the light of the sun; 'tis a trick of science and art, and
 that may happen in a mean base fellow, to be a good fencer. The estimate
 and value of a man consist in the heart and in the will: there his true
 honour lies. Valour is stability, not of legs and arms, but of the courage
 and the soul; it does not lie in the goodness of our horse or our arms but
 in our own. He that falls obstinate in his courage?

 Siculus, xv. 64.]?Who could have found out a more subtle invention
 to secure his safety, than he did to assure his destruction? He was set to
 defend a certain pass of Peloponnesus against the Arcadians, which,
 considering the nature of the place and the inequality of forces, finding
 it utterly impossible for him to do, and seeing that all who were
 presented to the enemy, must certainly be left upon the place; and on the
 other side, reputing it unworthy of his own virtue and magnanimity and of
 the Lacedaemonian name to fail in any part of his duty, he chose a mean
 betwixt these two extremes after this manner; the youngest and most active
 of his men, he preserved for the service and defence of their country, and
 sent them back; and with the rest, whose loss would be of less
 consideration, he resolved to make good the pass, and with the death of
 them, to make the enemy buy their entry as dear as possibly he could; as
 it fell out, for being presently environed on all sides by the Arcadians,
 after having made a great slaughter of the enemy, he and his were all cut
 in pieces. Is there any trophy dedicated to the conquerors which was not
 much more due to these who were overcome? The part that true conquering is
 to play, lies in the encounter, not in the coming off; and the honour of
 valour consists in fighting, not in subduing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But to return to my story: these prisoners are so far from discovering the
 least weakness, for all the terrors that can be represented to them, that,
 on the contrary, during the two or three months they are kept, they always
 appear with a cheerful countenance; importune their masters to make haste
 to bring them to the test, defy, rail at them, and reproach them with
 cowardice, and the number of battles they have lost against those of their
 country. I have a song made by one of these prisoners, wherein he bids
 them "come all, and dine upon him, and welcome, for they shall withal eat
 their own fathers and grandfathers, whose flesh has served to feed and
 nourish him. These muscles," says he, "this flesh and these veins, are
 your own: poor silly souls as you are, you little think that the substance
 of your ancestors' limbs is here yet; notice what you eat, and you will
 find in it the taste of your own flesh:" in which song there is to be
 observed an invention that nothing relishes of the barbarian. Those that
 paint these people dying after this manner, represent the prisoner
 spitting in the faces of his executioners and making wry mouths at them.
 And 'tis most certain, that to the very last gasp, they never cease to
 brave and defy them both in word and gesture. In plain truth, these men
 are very savage in comparison of us; of necessity, they must either be
 absolutely so or else we are savages; for there is a vast difference
 betwixt their manners and ours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The men there have several wives, and so much the greater number, by how
 much they have the greater reputation for valour. And it is one very
 remarkable feature in their marriages, that the same jealousy our wives
 have to hinder and divert us from the friendship and familiarity of other
 women, those employ to promote their husbands' desires, and to procure
 them many spouses; for being above all things solicitous of their
 husbands' honour, 'tis their chiefest care to seek out, and to bring in
 the most companions they can, forasmuch as it is a testimony of the
 husband's virtue. Most of our ladies will cry out, that 'tis monstrous;
 whereas in truth it is not so, but a truly matrimonial virtue, and of the
 highest form. In the Bible, Sarah, with Leah and Rachel, the two wives of
 Jacob, gave the most beautiful of their handmaids to their husbands; Livia
 preferred the passions of Augustus to her own interest; ?[Suetonius,
 Life of Augustus, c. 71.]?and the wife of King Deiotarus,
 Stratonice, did not only give up a fair young maid that served her to her
 husband's embraces, but moreover carefully brought up the children he had
 by her, and assisted them in the succession to their father's crown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And that it may not be supposed, that all this is done by a simple and
 servile obligation to their common practice, or by any authoritative
 impression of their ancient custom, without judgment or reasoning, and
 from having a soul so stupid that it cannot contrive what else to do, I
 must here give you some touches of their sufficiency in point of
 understanding. Besides what I repeated to you before, which was one of
 their songs of war, I have another, a love-song, that begins thus:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Stay, adder, stay, that by thy pattern my sister may draw the
 fashion and work of a rich ribbon, that I may present to my beloved,
 by which means thy beauty and the excellent order of thy scales
 shall for ever be preferred before all other serpents."
</pre>
 <p>
 Wherein the first couplet, "Stay, adder," &amp;c., makes the burden of the
 song. Now I have conversed enough with poetry to judge thus much that not
 only there is nothing barbarous in this invention, but, moreover, that it
 is perfectly Anacreontic. To which it may be added, that their language is
 soft, of a pleasing accent, and something bordering upon the Greek
 termination.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Three of these people, not foreseeing how dear their knowledge of the
 corruptions of this part of the world will one day cost their happiness
 and repose, and that the effect of this commerce will be their ruin, as I
 presuppose it is in a very fair way (miserable men to suffer themselves to
 be deluded with desire of novelty and to have left the serenity of their
 own heaven to come so far to gaze at ours!), were at Rouen at the time
 that the late King Charles IX. was there. The king himself talked to them
 a good while, and they were made to see our fashions, our pomp, and the
 form of a great city. After which, some one asked their opinion, and would
 know of them, what of all the things they had seen, they found most to be
 admired? To which they made answer, three things, of which I have
 forgotten the third, and am troubled at it, but two I yet remember. They
 said, that in the first place they thought it very strange that so many
 tall men, wearing beards, strong, and well armed, who were about the king
 ('tis like they meant the Swiss of the guard), should submit to obey a
 child, and that they did not rather choose out one amongst themselves to
 command. Secondly (they have a way of speaking in their language to call
 men the half of one another), that they had observed that there were
 amongst us men full and crammed with all manner of commodities, whilst, in
 the meantime, their halves were begging at their doors, lean and
 half-starved with hunger and poverty; and they thought it strange that
 these necessitous halves were able to suffer so great an inequality and
 injustice, and that they did not take the others by the throats, or set
 fire to their houses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I talked to one of them a great while together, but I had so ill an
 interpreter, and one who was so perplexed by his own ignorance to
 apprehend my meaning, that I could get nothing out of him of any moment:
 Asking him what advantage he reaped from the superiority he had amongst
 his own people (for he was a captain, and our mariners called him king),
 he told me, to march at the head of them to war. Demanding of him further
 how many men he had to follow him, he showed me a space of ground, to
 signify as many as could march in such a compass, which might be four or
 five thousand men; and putting the question to him whether or no his
 authority expired with the war, he told me this remained: that when he
 went to visit the villages of his dependence, they planed him paths
 through the thick of their woods, by which he might pass at his ease. All
 this does not sound very ill, and the last was not at all amiss, for they
 wear no breeches.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXI??THAT A MAN IS SOBERLY TO JUDGE OF THE DIVINE
 ORDINANCES
 </h2>
 <p>
 The true field and subject of imposture are things unknown, forasmuch as,
 in the first place, their very strangeness lends them credit, and
 moreover, by not being subjected to our ordinary reasons, they deprive us
 of the means to question and dispute them: For which reason, says Plato,
 ?[In Critias.]?it is much more easy to satisfy the hearers,
 when speaking of the nature of the gods than of the nature of men, because
 the ignorance of the auditory affords a fair and large career and all
 manner of liberty in the handling of abstruse things. Thence it comes to
 pass, that nothing is so firmly believed, as what we least know; nor any
 people so confident, as those who entertain us with fables, such as your
 alchemists, judicial astrologers, fortune-tellers, and physicians,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Id genus omne."

 ["All that sort of people."?Horace, Sat., i. 2, 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 To which I would willingly, if I durst, join a pack of people that take
 upon them to interpret and control the designs of God Himself, pretending
 to find out the cause of every accident, and to pry into the secrets of
 the divine will, there to discover the incomprehensible motive, of His
 works; and although the variety, and the continual discordance of events,
 throw them from corner to corner, and toss them from east to west, yet do
 they still persist in their vain inquisition, and with the same pencil to
 paint black and white.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a nation of the Indies, there is this commendable custom, that when
 anything befalls them amiss in any encounter or battle, they publicly ask
 pardon of the sun, who is their god, as having committed an unjust action,
 always imputing their good or evil fortune to the divine justice, and to
 that submitting their own judgment and reason. 'Tis enough for a Christian
 to believe that all things come from God, to receive them with
 acknowledgment of His divine and inscrutable wisdom, and also thankfully
 to accept and receive them, with what face soever they may present
 themselves. But I do not approve of what I see in use, that is, to seek to
 affirm and support our religion by the prosperity of our enterprises. Our
 belief has other foundation enough, without going about to authorise it by
 events: for the people being accustomed to such plausible arguments as
 these and so proper to their taste, it is to be feared, lest when they
 fail of success they should also stagger in their faith: as in the war
 wherein we are now engaged upon the account of religion, those who had the
 better in the business of Rochelabeille,?[May 1569.]?making
 great brags of that success as an infallible approbation of their cause,
 when they came afterwards to excuse their misfortunes of Moncontour and
 Jarnac, by saying they were fatherly scourges and corrections that they
 had not a people wholly at their mercy, they make it manifestly enough
 appear, what it is to take two sorts of grist out of the same sack, and
 with the same mouth to blow hot and cold. It were better to possess the
 vulgar with the solid and real foundations of truth. 'Twas a fine naval
 battle that was gained under the command of Don John of Austria a few
 months since?[That of Lepanto, October 7, 1571.]?against the
 Turks; but it has also pleased God at other times to let us see as great
 victories at our own expense. In fine, 'tis a hard matter to reduce divine
 things to our balance, without waste and losing a great deal of the
 weight. And who would take upon him to give a reason that Arius and his
 Pope Leo, the principal heads of the Arian heresy, should die, at several
 times, of so like and strange deaths (for being withdrawn from the
 disputation by a griping in the bowels, they both of them suddenly gave up
 the ghost upon the stool), and would aggravate this divine vengeance by
 the circumstances of the place, might as well add the death of
 Heliogabalus, who was also slain in a house of office. And, indeed,
 Irenaeus was involved in the same fortune. God, being pleased to show us,
 that the good have something else to hope for and the wicked something
 else to fear, than the fortunes or misfortunes of this world, manages and
 applies these according to His own occult will and pleasure, and deprives
 us of the means foolishly to make thereof our own profit. And those people
 abuse themselves who will pretend to dive into these mysteries by the
 strength of human reason. They never give one hit that they do not receive
 two for it; of which St. Augustine makes out a great proof upon his
 adversaries. 'Tis a conflict that is more decided by strength of memory
 than by the force of reason. We are to content ourselves with the light it
 pleases the sun to communicate to us, by virtue of his rays; and who will
 lift up his eyes to take in a greater, let him not think it strange, if
 for the reward of his presumption, he there lose his sight.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXII??THAT WE ARE TO AVOID PLEASURES, EVEN AT THE
 EXPENSE OF LIFE
 </h2>
 <p>
 I had long ago observed most of the opinions of the ancients to concur in
 this, that it is high time to die when there is more ill than good in
 living, and that to preserve life to our own torment and inconvenience is
 contrary to the very rules of nature, as these old laws instruct us.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Either tranquil life, or happy death. It is well to die when life
 is wearisome. It is better to die than to live miserable."
 ?Stobaeus, Serm. xx.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But to push this contempt of death so far as to employ it to the removing
 our thoughts from the honours, riches, dignities, and other favours and
 goods, as we call them, of fortune, as if reason were not sufficient to
 persuade us to avoid them, without adding this new injunction, I had never
 seen it either commanded or practised, till this passage of Seneca fell
 into my hands; who advising Lucilius, a man of great power and authority
 about the emperor, to alter his voluptuous and magnificent way of living,
 and to retire himself from this worldly vanity and ambition, to some
 solitary, quiet, and philosophical life, and the other alleging some
 difficulties: "I am of opinion," says he, "either that thou leave that
 life of thine, or life itself; I would, indeed, advise thee to the gentle
 way, and to untie, rather than to break, the knot thou hast indiscreetly
 knit, provided, that if it be not otherwise to be untied, thou resolutely
 break it. There is no man so great a coward, that had not rather once fall
 than to be always falling." I should have found this counsel conformable
 enough to the Stoical roughness: but it appears the more strange, for
 being borrowed from Epicurus, who writes the same thing upon the like
 occasion to Idomeneus. And I think I have observed something like it, but
 with Christian moderation, amongst our own people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 St. Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers, that famous enemy of the Arian heresy,
 being in Syria, had intelligence thither sent him, that Abra, his only
 daughter, whom he left at home under the eye and tuition of her mother,
 was sought in marriage by the greatest noblemen of the country, as being a
 virgin virtuously brought up, fair, rich, and in the flower of her age;
 whereupon he wrote to her (as appears upon record), that she should remove
 her affection from all the pleasures and advantages proposed to her; for
 that he had in his travels found out a much greater and more worthy
 fortune for her, a husband of much greater power and magnificence, who
 would present her with robes and jewels of inestimable value; wherein his
 design was to dispossess her of the appetite and use of worldly delights,
 to join her wholly to God; but the nearest and most certain way to this,
 being, as he conceived, the death of his daughter; he never ceased, by
 vows, prayers, and orisons, to beg of the Almighty, that He would please
 to call her out of this world, and to take her to Himself; as accordingly
 it came to pass; for soon after his return, she died, at which he
 expressed a singular joy. This seems to outdo the other, forasmuch as he
 applies himself to this means at the outset, which they only take
 subsidiarily; and, besides, it was towards his only daughter. But I will
 not omit the latter end of this story, though it be for my purpose; St.
 Hilary's wife, having understood from him how the death of their daughter
 was brought about by his desire and design, and how much happier she was
 to be removed out of this world than to have stayed in it, conceived so
 vivid an apprehension of the eternal and heavenly beatitude, that she
 begged of her husband, with the extremest importunity, to do as much for
 her; and God, at their joint request, shortly after calling her to Him, it
 was a death embraced with singular and mutual content.

 CHAPTER XXXIII??THAT FORTUNE IS OFTEN-TIMES OBSERVED TO ACT BY
 THE RULE OF REASON
 </h2>
 <h3>
 The inconstancy and various motions of Fortune
 </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [The term Fortune, so often employed by Montaigne, and in passages
 where he might have used Providence, was censured by the doctors who
 examined his Essays when he was at Rome in 1581. See his Travels,
 i. 35 and 76.]
</pre>
 <p>
 may reasonably make us expect she should present us with all sorts of
 faces. Can there be a more express act of justice than this? The Duc de
 Valentinois,?[Caesar Borgia.]?having resolved to poison
 Adrian, Cardinal of Corneto, with whom Pope Alexander VI., his father and
 himself, were to sup in the Vatican, he sent before a bottle of poisoned
 wine, and withal, strict order to the butler to keep it very safe. The
 Pope being come before his son, and calling for drink, the butler
 supposing this wine had not been so strictly recommended to his care, but
 only upon the account of its excellency, presented it forthwith to the
 Pope, and the duke himself coming in presently after, and being confident
 they had not meddled with his bottle, took also his cup; so that the
 father died immediately upon the spot?[Other historians assign the
 Pope several days of misery prior to death. D.W.]?, and the son,
 after having been long tormented with sickness, was reserved to another
 and a worse fortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes she seems to play upon us, just in the nick of an affair;
 Monsieur d'Estrees, at that time ensign to Monsieur de Vendome, and
 Monsieur de Licques, lieutenant in the company of the Duc d'Ascot, being
 both pretenders to the Sieur de Fougueselles' sister, though of several
 parties (as it oft falls out amongst frontier neighbours), the Sieur de
 Licques carried her; but on the same day he was married, and which was
 worse, before he went to bed to his wife, the bridegroom having a mind to
 break a lance in honour of his new bride, went out to skirmish near St.
 Omer, where the Sieur d'Estrees proving the stronger, took him prisoner,
 and the more to illustrate his victory, the lady was fain?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Conjugis ante coacta novi dimittere collum,
 Quam veniens una atque altera rursus hyems
 Noctibus in longis avidum saturasset amorem,"

 ["Compelled to abstain from embracing her new spouse in her arms
 before two winters pass in succession, during their long nights had
 satiated her eager love."?Catullus, lxviii. 81.]
</pre>
 <p>
 ?to request him of courtesy, to deliver up his prisoner to her, as
 he accordingly did, the gentlemen of France never denying anything to
 ladies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Does she not seem to be an artist here? Constantine, son of Helena,
 founded the empire of Constantinople, and so many ages after, Constantine,
 the son of Helen, put an end to it. Sometimes she is pleased to emulate
 our miracles we are told, that King Clovis besieging Angouleme, the walls
 fell down of themselves by divine favour and Bouchet has it from some
 author, that King Robert having sat down before a city, and being stolen
 away from the siege to go keep the feast of St. Aignan at Orleans, as he
 was in devotion at a certain part of the Mass, the walls of the
 beleaguered city, without any manner of violence, fell down with a sudden
 ruin. But she did quite contrary in our Milan wars; for, le Capitaine
 Rense laying siege for us to the city Arona, and having carried a mine
 under a great part of the wall, the mine being sprung, the wall was lifted
 from its base, but dropped down again nevertheless, whole and entire, and
 so exactly upon its foundation, that the besieged suffered no
 inconvenience by that attempt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes she plays the physician. Jason of Pheres being given over by the
 physicians, by reason of an imposthume in his breast, having a mind to rid
 himself of his pain, by death at least, threw himself in a battle
 desperately into the thickest of the enemy, where he was so fortunately
 wounded quite through the body, that the imposthume broke, and he was
 perfectly cured. Did she not also excel the painter Protogenes in his art?
 who having finished the picture of a dog quite tired and out of breath, in
 all the other parts excellently well to his own liking, but not being able
 to express, as he would, the slaver and foam that should come out of its
 mouth, vexed and angry at his work, he took his sponge, which by cleaning
 his pencils had imbibed several sorts of colours, and threw it in a rage
 against the picture, with an intent utterly to deface it; when fortune
 guiding the sponge to hit just upon the mouth of the dog, it there
 performed what all his art was not able to do. Does she not sometimes
 direct our counsels and correct them? Isabel, Queen of England, having to
 sail from Zealand into her own kingdom,?[in 1326]? with an
 army, in favour of her son against her husband, had been lost, had she
 come into the port she intended, being there laid wait for by the enemy;
 but fortune, against her will, threw her into another haven, where she
 landed in safety. And that man of old who, throwing a stone at a dog, hit
 and killed his mother-in-law, had he not reason to pronounce this verse:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Fortune has more judgement than we."?Menander]
</pre>
 <p>
 Icetes had contracted with two soldiers to kill Timoleon at Adrana in
 Sicily.?[Plutarch, Life of Timoleon, c. 7.]?They took their
 time to do it when he was assisting at a sacrifice, and thrusting into the
 crowd, as they were making signs to one another, that now was a fit time
 to do their business, in steps a third, who, with a sword takes one of
 them full drive over the pate, lays him dead upon the place and runs away,
 which the others see, and concluding himself discovered and lost, runs to
 the altar and begs for mercy, promising to discover the whole truth, which
 as he was doing, and laying open the full conspiracy, behold the third
 man, who being apprehended, was, as a murderer, thrust and hauled by the
 people through the press, towards Timoleon, and the other most eminent
 persons of the assembly, before whom being brought, he cries out for
 pardon, pleading that he had justly slain his father's murderer; which he,
 also, proving upon the spot, by sufficient witnesses, whom his good
 fortune very opportunely supplied him withal, that his father was really
 killed in the city of Leontini, by that very man on whom he had taken his
 revenge, he was presently awarded ten Attic minae, for having had the good
 fortune, by designing to revenge the death of his father, to preserve the
 life of the common father of Sicily. Fortune, truly, in her conduct
 surpasses all the rules of human prudence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But to conclude: is there not a direct application of her favour, bounty,
 and piety manifestly discovered in this action? Ignatius the father and
 Ignatius the son being proscribed by the triumvirs of Rome, resolved upon
 this generous act of mutual kindness, to fall by the hands of one another,
 and by that means to frustrate and defeat the cruelty of the tyrants; and
 accordingly with their swords drawn, ran full drive upon one another,
 where fortune so guided the points, that they made two equally mortal
 wounds, affording withal so much honour to so brave a friendship, as to
 leave them just strength enough to draw out their bloody swords, that they
 might have liberty to embrace one another in this dying condition, with so
 close and hearty an embrace, that the executioner cut off both their heads
 at once, leaving the bodies still fast linked together in this noble bond,
 and their wounds joined mouth to mouth, affectionately sucking in the last
 blood and remainder of the lives of each other.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXIV??OF ONE DEFECT IN OUR GOVERNMENT
 </h2>
 <p>
 My late father, a man that had no other advantages than experience and his
 own natural parts, was nevertheless of a very clear judgment, formerly
 told me that he once had thoughts of endeavouring to introduce this
 practice; that there might be in every city a certain place assigned to
 which such as stood in need of anything might repair, and have their
 business entered by an officer appointed for that purpose. As for example:
 I want a chapman to buy my pearls; I want one that has pearls to sell;
 such a one wants company to go to Paris; such a one seeks a servant of
 such a quality; such a one a master; such a one such an artificer; some
 inquiring for one thing, some for another, every one according to what he
 wants. And doubtless, these mutual advertisements would be of no
 contemptible advantage to the public correspondence and intelligence: for
 there are evermore conditions that hunt after one another, and for want of
 knowing one another's occasions leave men in very great necessity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have heard, to the great shame of the age we live in, that in our very
 sight two most excellent men for learning died so poor that they had
 scarce bread to put in their mouths: Lilius Gregorius Giraldus in Italy
 and Sebastianus Castalio in Germany: and I believe there are a thousand
 men would have invited them into their families, with very advantageous
 conditions, or have relieved them where they were, had they known their
 wants. The world is not so generally corrupted, but that I know a man that
 would heartily wish the estate his ancestors have left him might be
 employed, so long as it shall please fortune to give him leave to enjoy
 it, to secure rare and remarkable persons of any kind, whom misfortune
 sometimes persecutes to the last degree, from the dangers of necessity;
 and at least place them in such a condition that they must be very hard to
 please, if they are not contented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My father in his domestic economy had this rule (which I know how to
 commend, but by no means to imitate), namely, that besides the day-book or
 memorial of household affairs, where the small accounts, payments, and
 disbursements, which do not require a secretary's hand, were entered, and
 which a steward always had in custody, he ordered him whom he employed to
 write for him, to keep a journal, and in it to set down all the remarkable
 occurrences, and daily memorials of the history of his house: very
 pleasant to look over, when time begins to wear things out of memory, and
 very useful sometimes to put us out of doubt when such a thing was begun,
 when ended; what visitors came, and when they went; our travels, absences,
 marriages, and deaths; the reception of good or ill news; the change of
 principal servants, and the like. An ancient custom, which I think it
 would not be amiss for every one to revive in his own house; and I find I
 did very foolishly in neglecting it.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXV??OF THE CUSTOM OF WEARING CLOTHES
 </h2>
 <p>
 Whatever I shall say upon this subject, I am of necessity to invade some
 of the bounds of custom, so careful has she been to shut up all the
 avenues. I was disputing with myself in this shivering season, whether the
 fashion of going naked in those nations lately discovered is imposed upon
 them by the hot temperature of the air, as we say of the Indians and
 Moors, or whether it be the original fashion of mankind. Men of
 understanding, forasmuch as all things under the sun, as the Holy Writ
 declares, are subject to the same laws, were wont in such considerations
 as these, where we are to distinguish the natural laws from those which
 have been imposed by man's invention, to have recourse to the general
 polity of the world, where there can be nothing counterfeit. Now, all
 other creatures being sufficiently furnished with all things necessary for
 the support of their being?[Montaigne's expression is, "with needle
 and thread."?W.C.H.]?it is not to be imagined that we only are
 brought into the world in a defective and indigent condition, and in such
 a state as cannot subsist without external aid. Therefore it is that I
 believe, that as plants, trees, and animals, and all things that have
 life, are seen to be by nature sufficiently clothed and covered, to defend
 them from the injuries of weather:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Proptereaque fere res omnes ant corio sunt,
 Aut seta, ant conchis, ant callo, ant cortice tectae,"

 ["And that for this reason nearly all things are clothed with skin,
 or hair, or shells, or bark, or some such thing."
 ?Lucretius, iv. 936.]
</pre>
 <p>
 so were we: but as those who by artificial light put out that of day, so
 we by borrowed forms and fashions have destroyed our own. And 'tis plain
 enough to be seen, that 'tis custom only which renders that impossible
 that otherwise is nothing so; for of those nations who have no manner of
 knowledge of clothing, some are situated under the same temperature that
 we are, and some in much colder climates. And besides, our most tender
 parts are always exposed to the air, as the eyes, mouth, nose, and ears;
 and our country labourers, like our ancestors in former times, go with
 their breasts and bellies open. Had we been born with a necessity upon us
 of wearing petticoats and breeches, there is no doubt but nature would
 have fortified those parts she intended should be exposed to the fury of
 the seasons with a thicker skin, as she has done the finger-ends and the
 soles of the feet. And why should this seem hard to believe? I observe
 much greater distance betwixt my habit and that of one of our country
 boors, than betwixt his and that of a man who has no other covering but
 his skin. How many men, especially in Turkey, go naked upon the account of
 devotion? Some one asked a beggar, whom he saw in his shirt in the depth
 of winter, as brisk and frolic as he who goes muffled up to the ears in
 furs, how he was able to endure to go so? "Why, sir," he answered, "you go
 with your face bare: I am all face." The Italians have a story of the Duke
 of Florence's fool, whom his master asking how, being so thinly clad, he
 was able to support the cold, when he himself, warmly wrapped up as he
 was, was hardly able to do it? "Why," replied the fool, "use my receipt to
 put on all your clothes you have at once, and you'll feel no more cold
 than I." King Massinissa, to an extreme old age, could never be prevailed
 upon to go with his head covered, how cold, stormy, or rainy soever the
 weather might be; which also is reported of the Emperor Severus. Herodotus
 tells us, that in the battles fought betwixt the Egyptians and the
 Persians, it was observed both by himself and by others, that of those who
 were left dead upon the field, the heads of the Egyptians were without
 comparison harder than those of the Persians, by reason that the last had
 gone with their heads always covered from their infancy, first with
 biggins, and then with turbans, and the others always shaved and bare.
 King Agesilaus continued to a decrepit age to wear always the same clothes
 in winter that he did in summer. Caesar, says Suetonius, marched always at
 the head of his army, for the most part on foot, with his head bare,
 whether it was rain or sunshine, and as much is said of Hannibal:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tum vertice nudo,
 Excipere insanos imbres, coelique ruinam."

 ["Bareheaded he marched in snow, exposed to pouring rain and the
 utmost rigour of the weather."?Silius Italicus, i. 250.]
</pre>
 <p>
 A Venetian who has long lived in Pegu, and has lately returned thence,
 writes that the men and women of that kingdom, though they cover all their
 other parts, go always barefoot and ride so too; and Plato very earnestly
 advises for the health of the whole body, to give the head and the feet no
 other clothing than what nature has bestowed. He whom the Poles have
 elected for their king,?[Stephen Bathory]?since ours came
 thence, who is, indeed, one of the greatest princes of this age, never
 wears any gloves, and in winter or whatever weather can come, never wears
 other cap abroad than that he wears at home. Whereas I cannot endure to go
 unbuttoned or untied; my neighbouring labourers would think themselves in
 chains, if they were so braced. Varro is of opinion, that when it was
 ordained we should be bare in the presence of the gods and before the
 magistrate, it was so ordered rather upon the score of health, and to
 inure us to the injuries of weather, than upon the account of reverence;
 and since we are now talking of cold, and Frenchmen used to wear variety
 of colours (not I myself, for I seldom wear other than black or white, in
 imitation of my father), let us add another story out of Le Capitaine
 Martin du Bellay, who affirms, that in the march to Luxembourg he saw so
 great frost, that the munition-wine was cut with hatchets and wedges, and
 delivered out to the soldiers by weight, and that they carried it away in
 baskets: and Ovid,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nudaque consistunt, formam servantia testae,
 Vina; nec hausta meri, sed data frusta, bibunt."

 ["The wine when out of the cask retains the form of the cask;
 and is given out not in cups, but in bits."
 ?Ovid, Trist., iii. 10, 23.]
</pre>
 <p>
 At the mouth of Lake Maeotis the frosts are so very sharp, that in the
 very same place where Mithridates' lieutenant had fought the enemy dryfoot
 and given them a notable defeat, the summer following he obtained over
 them a naval victory. The Romans fought at a very great disadvantage, in
 the engagement they had with the Carthaginians near Piacenza, by reason
 that they went to the charge with their blood congealed and their limbs
 numbed with cold, whereas Hannibal had caused great fires to be dispersed
 quite through his camp to warm his soldiers, and oil to be distributed
 amongst them, to the end that anointing themselves, they might render
 their nerves more supple and active, and fortify the pores against the
 violence of the air and freezing wind, which raged in that season.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The retreat the Greeks made from Babylon into their own country is famous
 for the difficulties and calamities they had to overcome; of which this
 was one, that being encountered in the mountains of Armenia with a
 horrible storm of snow, they lost all knowledge of the country and of the
 ways, and being driven up, were a day and a night without eating or
 drinking; most of their cattle died, many of themselves were starved to
 death, several struck blind with the force of the hail and the glare of
 the snow, many of them maimed in their fingers and toes, and many stiff
 and motionless with the extremity of the cold, who had yet their
 understanding entire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Alexander saw a nation, where they bury their fruit-trees in winter to
 protect them from being destroyed by the frost, and we also may see the
 same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, so far as clothes go, the King of Mexico changed four times a day his
 apparel, and never put it on again, employing that he left off in his
 continual liberalities and rewards; and neither pot, dish, nor other
 utensil of his kitchen or table was ever served twice.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXVI??OF CATO THE YOUNGER
 </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["I am not possessed with this common errour, to judge of others
 according to what I am my selfe. I am easie to beleeve things
 differing from my selfe. Though I be engaged to one forme, I do not
 tie the world unto it, as every man doth. And I beleeve and
 conceive a thousand manners of life, contrary to the common sorte."
 ?Florio, ed. 1613, p. 113.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I am not guilty of the common error of judging another by myself. I easily
 believe that in another's humour which is contrary to my own; and though I
 find myself engaged to one certain form, I do not oblige others to it, as
 many do; but believe and apprehend a thousand ways of living; and,
 contrary to most men, more easily admit of difference than uniformity
 amongst us. I as frankly as any one would have me, discharge a man from my
 humours and principles, and consider him according to his own particular
 model. Though I am not continent myself, I nevertheless sincerely approve
 the continence of the Feuillans and Capuchins, and highly commend their
 way of living. I insinuate myself by imagination into their place, and
 love and honour them the more for being other than I am. I very much
 desire that we may be judged every man by himself, and would not be drawn
 into the consequence of common examples. My own weakness nothing alters
 the esteem I ought to have for the force and vigour of those who deserve
 it:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sunt qui nihil suadent, quam quod se imitari posse confidunt."

 ["There are who persuade nothing but what they believe they can
 imitate themselves."?Cicero, De Orator., c. 7.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Crawling upon the slime of the earth, I do not for all that cease to
 observe up in the clouds the inimitable height of some heroic souls. 'Tis
 a great deal for me to have my judgment regular and just, if the effects
 cannot be so, and to maintain this sovereign part, at least, free from
 corruption; 'tis something to have my will right and good where my legs
 fail me. This age wherein we live, in our part of the world at least, is
 grown so stupid, that not only the exercise, but the very imagination of
 virtue is defective, and seems to be no other but college jargon:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Virtutem verba putant, ut
 Lucum ligna:"

 ["They think words virtue, as they think mere wood a sacred grove."
 ?Horace, Ep., i. 6, 31.]

 "Quam vereri deberent, etiam si percipere non possent."

 ["Which they ought to reverence, though they cannot comprehend."
 ?Cicero, Tusc. Quas., v. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 'Tis a gewgaw to hang in a cabinet or at the end of the tongue, as on the
 tip of the ear, for ornament only. There are no longer virtuous actions
 extant; those actions that carry a show of virtue have yet nothing of its
 essence; by reason that profit, glory, fear, custom, and other suchlike
 foreign causes, put us on the way to produce them. Our justice also,
 valour, courtesy, may be called so too, in respect to others and according
 to the face they appear with to the public; but in the doer it can by no
 means be virtue, because there is another end proposed, another moving
 cause. Now virtue owns nothing to be hers, but what is done by herself and
 for herself alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In that great battle of Plataea, that the Greeks under the command of
 Pausanias gained against Mardonius and the Persians, the conquerors,
 according to their custom, coming to divide amongst them the glory of the
 exploit, attributed to the Spartan nation the pre-eminence of valour in
 the engagement. The Spartans, great judges of virtue, when they came to
 determine to what particular man of their nation the honour was due of
 having the best behaved himself upon this occasion, found that Aristodemus
 had of all others hazarded his person with the greatest bravery; but did
 not, however, allow him any prize, by reason that his virtue had been
 incited by a desire to clear his reputation from the reproach of his
 miscarriage at the business of Thermopylae, and to die bravely to wipe off
 that former blemish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Our judgments are yet sick, and obey the humour of our depraved manners. I
 observe most of the wits of these times pretend to ingenuity, by
 endeavouring to blemish and darken the glory of the bravest and most
 generous actions of former ages, putting one vile interpretation or
 another upon them, and forging and supposing vain causes and motives for
 the noble things they did: a mighty subtlety indeed! Give me the greatest
 and most unblemished action that ever the day beheld, and I will contrive
 a hundred plausible drifts and ends to obscure it. God knows, whoever will
 stretch them out to the full, what diversity of images our internal wills
 suffer under. They do not so maliciously play the censurers, as they do it
 ignorantly and rudely in all their detractions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The same pains and licence that others take to blemish and bespatter these
 illustrious names, I would willingly undergo to lend them a shoulder to
 raise them higher. These rare forms, that are culled out by the consent of
 the wisest men of all ages, for the world's example, I should not stick to
 augment in honour, as far as my invention would permit, in all the
 circumstances of favourable interpretation; and we may well believe that
 the force of our invention is infinitely short of their merit. 'Tis the
 duty of good men to portray virtue as beautiful as they can, and there
 would be nothing wrong should our passion a little transport us in favour
 of so sacred a form. What these people do, on the contrary, they either do
 out of malice, or by the vice of confining their belief to their own
 capacity; or, which I am more inclined to think, for not having their
 sight strong, clear, and elevated enough to conceive the splendour of
 virtue in her native purity: as Plutarch complains, that in his time some
 attributed the cause of the younger Cato's death to his fear of Caesar, at
 which he seems very angry, and with good reason; and by this a man may
 guess how much more he would have been offended with those who have
 attributed it to ambition. Senseless people! He would rather have
 performed a noble, just, and generous action, and to have had ignominy for
 his reward, than for glory. That man was in truth a pattern that nature
 chose out to show to what height human virtue and constancy could arrive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I am not capable of handling so rich an argument, and shall therefore
 only set five Latin poets together, contending in the praise of Cato; and,
 incidentally, for their own too. Now, a well-educated child will judge the
 two first, in comparison of the others, a little flat and languid; the
 third more vigorous, but overthrown by the extravagance of his own force;
 he will then think that there will be room for one or two gradations of
 invention to come to the fourth, and, mounting to the pitch of that, he
 will lift up his hands in admiration; coming to the last, the first by
 some space' (but a space that he will swear is not to be filled up by any
 human wit), he will be astounded, he will not know where he is.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And here is a wonder: we have far more poets than judges and interpreters
 of poetry; it is easier to write it than to understand it. There is,
 indeed, a certain low and moderate sort of poetry, that a man may well
 enough judge by certain rules of art; but the true, supreme, and divine
 poesy is above all rules and reason. And whoever discerns the beauty of it
 with the most assured and most steady sight, sees no more than the quick
 reflection of a flash of lightning: it does not exercise, but ravishes and
 overwhelms our judgment. The fury that possesses him who is able to
 penetrate into it wounds yet a third man by hearing him repeat it; like a
 loadstone that not only attracts the needle, but also infuses into it the
 virtue to attract others. And it is more evidently manifest in our
 theatres, that the sacred inspiration of the Muses, having first stirred
 up the poet to anger, sorrow, hatred, and out of himself, to whatever they
 will, does moreover by the poet possess the actor, and by the actor
 consecutively all the spectators. So much do our passions hang and depend
 upon one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poetry has ever had that power over me from a child to transpierce and
 transport me; but this vivid sentiment that is natural to me has been
 variously handled by variety of forms, not so much higher or lower (for
 they were ever the highest of every kind), as differing in colour. First,
 a gay and sprightly fluency; afterwards, a lofty and penetrating subtlety;
 and lastly, a mature and constant vigour. Their names will better express
 them: Ovid, Lucan, Virgil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But our poets are beginning their career:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sit Cato, dum vivit, sane vel Caesare major,"

 ["Let Cato, whilst he live, be greater than Caesar."
 ?Martial, vi. 32]
</pre>
 <p>
 says one.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et invictum, devicta morte, Catonem,"

 ["And Cato invincible, death being overcome."
 ?Manilius, Astron., iv. 87.]
</pre>
 <p>
 says the second. And the third, speaking of the civil wars betwixt Caesar
 and Pompey,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Victrix causa diis placuit, set victa Catoni."

 ["The victorious cause blessed the gods, the defeated one Cato.
 ?"Lucan, i. 128.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And the fourth, upon the praises of Caesar:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et cuncta terrarum subacta,
 Praeter atrocem animum Catonis."

 ["And conquered all but the indomitable mind of Cato."
 ?Horace, Od., ii. 1, 23.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And the master of the choir, after having set forth all the great names of
 the greatest Romans, ends thus:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "His dantem jura Catonem."

 ["Cato giving laws to all the rest."?AEneid, viii. 670.]

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXVII??THAT WE LAUGH AND CRY FOR THE SAME THING
 </h2>
 <p>
 When we read in history that Antigonus was very much displeased with his
 son for presenting him the head of King Pyrrhus his enemy, but newly slain
 fighting against him, and that seeing it, he wept; and that Rene, Duke of
 Lorraine, also lamented the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, whom he
 had himself defeated, and appeared in mourning at his funeral; and that in
 the battle of D'Auray (which Count Montfort obtained over Charles de
 Blois, his competitor for the duchy of Brittany), the conqueror meeting
 the dead body of his enemy, was very much afflicted at his death, we must
 not presently cry out:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "E cosi avven, the l'animo ciascuna
 Sua passion sotto 'l contrario manto,
 Ricopre, con la vista or'chiara, or'bruna."

 ["And thus it happens that the mind of each veils its passion under
 a different appearance, and beneath a smiling visage, gay beneath a
 sombre air."?Petrarch.]
</pre>
 <p>
 When Pompey's head was presented to Caesar, the histories tell us that he
 turned away his face, as from a sad and unpleasing object. There had been
 so long an intelligence and society betwixt them in the management of the
 public affairs, so great a community of fortunes, so many mutual offices,
 and so near an alliance, that this countenance of his ought not to suffer
 under any misinterpretation, or to be suspected for either false or
 counterfeit, as this other seems to believe:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tutumque putavit
 Jam bonus esse socer; lacrymae non sponte cadentes,
 Effudit, gemitusque expressit pectore laeto;"

 ["And now he thought it safe to play the kind father-in-law,
 shedding forced tears, and from a joyful breast discharging sighs
 and groans."?Lucan, ix. 1037.]
</pre>
 <p>
 for though it be true that the greatest part of our actions are no other
 than visor and disguise, and that it may sometimes be true that
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Haeredis fletus sub persona rises est,"

 ["The heir's tears behind the mask are smiles."
 ?Publius Syrus, apud Gellium, xvii. 14.]
</pre>
 <p>
 yet, in judging of these accidents, we are to consider how much our souls
 are oftentimes agitated with divers passions. And as they say that in our
 bodies there is a congregation of divers humours, of which that is the
 sovereign which, according to the complexion we are of, is commonly most
 predominant in us: so, though the soul have in it divers motions to give
 it agitation, yet must there of necessity be one to overrule all the rest,
 though not with so necessary and absolute a dominion but that through the
 flexibility and inconstancy of the soul, those of less authority may upon
 occasion reassume their place and make a little sally in turn. Thence it
 is, that we see not only children, who innocently obey and follow nature,
 often laugh and cry at the same thing, but not one of us can boast, what
 journey soever he may have in hand that he has the most set his heart
 upon, but when he comes to part with his family and friends, he will find
 something that troubles him within; and though he refrain his tears yet he
 puts foot in the stirrup with a sad and cloudy countenance. And what
 gentle flame soever may warm the heart of modest and wellborn virgins, yet
 are they fain to be forced from about their mothers' necks to be put to
 bed to their husbands, whatever this boon companion is pleased to say:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
 Frustrantur falsis gaudia lachrymulis,
 Ubertim thalami quasi intra limina fundunt?
 Non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, juverint."

 ["Is Venus really so alarming to the new-made bride, or does she
 honestly oppose her parent's rejoicing the tears she so abundantly
 sheds on entering the nuptial chamber? No, by the Gods, these are
 no true tears."?Catullus, lxvi. 15.]

 ["Is Venus really so repugnant to newly-married maids? Do they meet
 the smiles of parents with feigned tears? They weep copiously
 within the very threshold of the nuptial chamber. No, so the gods
 help me, they do not truly grieve."?Catullus, lxvi. 15.]?
 [A more literal translation. D.W.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Neither is it strange to lament a person dead whom a man would by no means
 should be alive. When I rattle my man, I do it with all the mettle I have,
 and load him with no feigned, but downright real curses; but the heat
 being over, if he should stand in need of me, I should be very ready to do
 him good: for I instantly turn the leaf. When I call him calf and coxcomb,
 I do not pretend to entail those titles upon him for ever; neither do I
 think I give myself the lie in calling him an honest fellow presently
 after. No one quality engrosses us purely and universally. Were it not the
 sign of a fool to talk to one's self, there would hardly be a day or hour
 wherein I might not be heard to grumble and mutter to myself and against
 myself, "Confound the fool!" and yet I do not think that to be my
 definition. Who for seeing me one while cold and presently very fond
 towards my wife, believes the one or the other to be counterfeited, is an
 ass. Nero, taking leave of his mother whom he was sending to be drowned,
 was nevertheless sensible of some emotion at this farewell, and was struck
 with horror and pity. 'Tis said, that the light of the sun is not one
 continuous thing, but that he darts new rays so thick one upon another
 that we cannot perceive the intermission:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Largus enim liquidi fons luminis, aetherius sol,
 Irrigat assidue coelum candore recenti,
 Suppeditatque novo confestim lumine lumen."

 ["So the wide fountain of liquid light, the ethereal sun, steadily
 fertilises the heavens with new heat, and supplies a continuous
 store of fresh light."?Lucretius, v. 282.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Just so the soul variously and imperceptibly darts out her passions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Artabanus coming by surprise once upon his nephew Xerxes, chid him for the
 sudden alteration of his countenance. He was considering the immeasurable
 greatness of his forces passing over the Hellespont for the Grecian
 expedition: he was first seized with a palpitation of joy, to see so many
 millions of men under his command, and this appeared in the gaiety of his
 looks: but his thoughts at the same instant suggesting to him that of so
 many lives, within a century at most, there would not be one left, he
 presently knit his brows and grew sad, even to tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We have resolutely pursued the revenge of an injury received, and been
 sensible of a singular contentment for the victory; but we shall weep
 notwithstanding. 'Tis not for the victory, though, that we shall weep:
 there is nothing altered in that but the soul looks upon things with
 another eye and represents them to itself with another kind of face; for
 everything has many faces and several aspects.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Relations, old acquaintances, and friendships, possess our imaginations
 and make them tender for the time, according to their condition; but the
 turn is so quick, that 'tis gone in a moment:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nil adeo fieri celeri ratione videtur,
 Quam si mens fieri proponit, et inchoat ipsa,
 Ocius ergo animus, quam res se perciet ulla,
 Ante oculos quorum in promptu natura videtur;"

 ["Nothing therefore seems to be done in so swift a manner than if
 the mind proposes it to be done, and itself begins. It is more
 active than anything which we see in nature."?Lucretius, iii. 183.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and therefore, if we would make one continued thing of all this succession
 of passions, we deceive ourselves. When Timoleon laments the murder he had
 committed upon so mature and generous deliberation, he does not lament the
 liberty restored to his country, he does not lament the tyrant; but he
 laments his brother: one part of his duty is performed; let us give him
 leave to perform the other.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXVIII??OF SOLITUDE
 </h2>
 <p>
 Let us pretermit that long comparison betwixt the active and the solitary
 life; and as for the fine sayings with which ambition and avarice palliate
 their vices, that we are not born for ourselves but for the public,?[This
 is the eulogium passed by Lucan on Cato of Utica, ii. 383.]?let us
 boldly appeal to those who are in public affairs; let them lay their hands
 upon their hearts, and then say whether, on the contrary, they do not
 rather aspire to titles and offices and that tumult of the world to make
 their private advantage at the public expense. The corrupt ways by which
 in this our time they arrive at the height to which their ambitions
 aspire, manifestly enough declares that their ends cannot be very good.
 Let us tell ambition that it is she herself who gives us a taste of
 solitude; for what does she so much avoid as society? What does she so
 much seek as elbowroom? A man many do well or ill everywhere; but if what
 Bias says be true, that the greatest part is the worse part, or what the
 Preacher says: there is not one good of a thousand:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Rari quippe boni: numero vix sunt totidem quot
 Thebarum portae, vel divitis ostia Nili,"

 ["Good men forsooth are scarce: there are hardly as many as there
 are gates of Thebes or mouths of the rich Nile."
 ?Juvenal, Sat., xiii. 26.]
</pre>
 <p>
 the contagion is very dangerous in the crowd. A man must either imitate
 the vicious or hate them both are dangerous things, either to resemble
 them because they are many or to hate many because they are unresembling
 to ourselves. Merchants who go to sea are in the right when they are
 cautious that those who embark with them in the same bottom be neither
 dissolute blasphemers nor vicious other ways, looking upon such society as
 unfortunate. And therefore it was that Bias pleasantly said to some, who
 being with him in a dangerous storm implored the assistance of the gods:
 "Peace, speak softly," said he, "that they may not know you are here in my
 company."?[Diogenes Laertius]?And of more pressing example,
 Albuquerque, viceroy in the Indies for Emmanuel, king of Portugal, in an
 extreme peril of shipwreck, took a young boy upon his shoulders, for this
 only end that, in the society of their common danger his innocence might
 serve to protect him, and to recommend him to the divine favour, that they
 might get safe to shore. 'Tis not that a wise man may not live everywhere
 content, and be alone in the very crowd of a palace; but if it be left to
 his own choice, the schoolman will tell you that he should fly the very
 sight of the crowd: he will endure it if need be; but if it be referred to
 him, he will choose to be alone. He cannot think himself sufficiently rid
 of vice, if he must yet contend with it in other men. Charondas punished
 those as evil men who were convicted of keeping ill company. There is
 nothing so unsociable and sociable as man, the one by his vice, the other
 by his nature. And Antisthenes, in my opinion, did not give him a
 satisfactory answer, who reproached him with frequenting ill company, by
 saying that the physicians lived well enough amongst the sick, for if they
 contribute to the health of the sick, no doubt but by the contagion,
 continual sight of, and familiarity with diseases, they must of necessity
 impair their own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now the end, I take it, is all one, to live at more leisure and at one's
 ease: but men do not always take the right way. They often think they have
 totally taken leave of all business, when they have only exchanged one
 employment for another: there is little less trouble in governing a
 private family than a whole kingdom. Wherever the mind is perplexed, it is
 in an entire disorder, and domestic employments are not less troublesome
 for being less important. Moreover, for having shaken off the court and
 the exchange, we have not taken leave of the principal vexations of life:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ratio et prudentia curas,
 Non locus effusi late maris arbiter, aufert;"

 ["Reason and prudence, not a place with a commanding view of the
 great ocean, banish care."?Horace, Ep., i. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 ambition, avarice, irresolution, fear, and inordinate desires, do not
 leave us because we forsake our native country:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et
 Post equitem sedet atra cura;"

 ["Black care sits behind the horse man."

 they often follow us even to cloisters and philosophical schools; nor
 deserts, nor caves, hair-shirts, nor fasts, can disengage us from them:

 One telling Socrates that such a one was nothing improved by his travels:
 "I very well believe it," said he, "for he took himself along with him"

 If a man do not first discharge both himself and his mind of the burden
 with which he finds himself oppressed, motion will but make it press the
 harder and sit the heavier, as the lading of a ship is of less encumbrance
 when fast and bestowed in a settled posture. You do a sick man more harm
 than good in removing him from place to place; you fix and establish the
 disease by motion, as stakes sink deeper and more firmly into the earth by
 being moved up and down in the place where they are designed to stand.
 Therefore, it is not enough to get remote from the public; 'tis not enough
 to shift the soil only; a man must flee from the popular conditions that
 have taken possession of his soul, he must sequester and come again to
 himself:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Rupi jam vincula, dicas
 Nam luctata canis nodum arripit; attamen illi,
 Quum fugit, a collo trahitur pars longa catenae."

 long efforts has broken his chain, still in his flight drags a heavy
 portion of it after him."?Persius, Sat., v. 158.]
</pre>
 <p>
 We still carry our fetters along with us. 'Tis not an absolute liberty; we
 yet cast back a look upon what we have left behind us; the fancy is still
 full of it:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nisi purgatum est pectus, quae praelia nobis
 Atque pericula tunc ingratis insinuandum?
 Quantae connscindunt hominem cupedinis acres

 Efficiunt clades? quid luxus desidiesque?"

 ["But unless the mind is purified, what internal combats and dangers
 must we incur in spite of all our efforts! How many bitter
 anxieties, how many terrors, follow upon unregulated passion!

 Our disease lies in the mind, which cannot escape from itself;

 and therefore is to be called home and confined within itself: that is the
 true solitude, and that may be enjoyed even in populous cities and the
 courts of kings, though more commodiously apart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, since we will attempt to live alone, and to waive all manner of
 conversation amongst them, let us so order it that our content may depend
 wholly upon ourselves; let us dissolve all obligations that ally us to
 others; let us obtain this from ourselves, that we may live alone in good
 earnest, and live at our ease too.

 Stilpo having escaped from the burning of his town, where he lost wife,
 children, and goods, Demetrius Poliorcetes seeing him, in so great a ruin
 of his country, appear with an undisturbed countenance, asked him if he
 had received no loss? To which he made answer, No; and that, thank God,
 nothing was lost of his.?[Seneca, Ep. 7.]?This also was the
 meaning of the philosopher Antisthenes, when he pleasantly said, that "men
 should furnish themselves with such things as would float, and might with
 the owner escape the storm";?[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 6.] and
 certainly a wise man never loses anything if he have himself. When the
 city of Nola was ruined by the barbarians, Paulinus, who was bishop of
 that place, having there lost all he had, himself a prisoner, prayed after
 this manner: "O Lord, defend me from being sensible of this loss; for Thou
 knowest they have yet touched nothing of that which is mine."?[St.
 Augustin, De Civit. Dei, i. 10.]?The riches that made him rich and
 the goods that made him good, were still kept entire. This it is to make
 choice of treasures that can secure themselves from plunder and violence,
 and to hide them in such a place into which no one can enter and that is
 not to be betrayed by any but ourselves. Wives, children, and goods must
 be had, and especially health, by him that can get it; but we are not so
 to set our hearts upon them that our happiness must have its dependence
 upon them; we must reserve a backshop, wholly our own and entirely free,
 wherein to settle our true liberty, our principal solitude and retreat.
 And in this we must for the most part entertain ourselves with ourselves,
 and so privately that no exotic knowledge or communication be admitted
 there; there to laugh and to talk, as if without wife, children, goods,
 train, or attendance, to the end that when it shall so fall out that we
 must lose any or all of these, it may be no new thing to be without them.
 We have a mind pliable in itself, that will be company; that has
 wherewithal to attack and to defend, to receive and to give: let us not
 then fear in this solitude to languish under an uncomfortable vacuity.

 Virtue is satisfied with herself, without discipline, without words,
 without effects. In our ordinary actions there is not one of a thousand
 that concerns ourselves. He that thou seest scrambling up the ruins of
 that wall, furious and transported, against whom so many harquebuss-shots
 are levelled; and that other all over scars, pale, and fainting with
 hunger, and yet resolved rather to die than to open the gates to him; dost
 thou think that these men are there upon their own account? No;
 peradventure in the behalf of one whom they never saw and who never
 concerns himself for their pains and danger, but lies wallowing the while
 in sloth and pleasure: this other slavering, blear-eyed, slovenly fellow,
 that thou seest come out of his study after midnight, dost thou think he
 has been tumbling over books to learn how to become a better man, wiser,
 and more content? No such matter; he will there end his days, but he will
 teach posterity the measure of Plautus' verses and the true orthography of
 a Latin word. Who is it that does not voluntarily exchange his health, his
 repose, and his very life for reputation and glory, the most useless,
 frivolous, and false coin that passes current amongst us? Our own death
 does not sufficiently terrify and trouble us; let us, moreover, charge
 ourselves with those of our wives, children, and family: our own affairs
 do not afford us anxiety enough; let us undertake those of our neighbours
 and friends, still more to break our brains and torment us:

 Solitude seems to me to wear the best favour in such as have already
 employed their most active and flourishing age in the world's service,
 after the example of Thales. We have lived enough for others; let us at
 least live out the small remnant of life for ourselves; let us now call in
 our thoughts and intentions to ourselves, and to our own ease and repose.
 'Tis no light thing to make a sure retreat; it will be enough for us to do
 without mixing other enterprises. Since God gives us leisure to order our
 removal, let us make ready, truss our baggage, take leave betimes of the
 company, and disentangle ourselves from those violent importunities that
 engage us elsewhere and separate us from ourselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We must break the knot of our obligations, how strong soever, and
 hereafter love this or that, but espouse nothing but ourselves: that is to
 say, let the remainder be our own, but not so joined and so close as not
 to be forced away without flaying us or tearing out part of our whole. The
 greatest thing in the world is for a man to know that he is his own. 'Tis
 time to wean ourselves from society when we can no longer add anything to
 it; he who is not in a condition to lend must forbid himself to borrow.
 Our forces begin to fail us; let us call them in and concentrate them in
 and for ourselves. He that can cast off within himself and resolve the
 offices of friendship and company, let him do it. In this decay of nature
 which renders him useless, burdensome, and importunate to others, let him
 take care not to be useless, burdensome, and importunate to himself. Let
 him soothe and caress himself, and above all things be sure to govern
 himself with reverence to his reason and conscience to that degree as to
 be ashamed to make a false step in their presence:
 </p><br>

 <p>
 Socrates says that boys are to cause themselves to be instructed, men to
 exercise themselves in well-doing, and old men to retire from all civil
 and military employments, living at their own discretion, without the
 obligation to any office. There are some complexions more proper for these
 precepts of retirement than others. Such as are of a soft and dull
 apprehension, and of a tender will and affection, not readily to be
 subdued or employed, whereof I am one, both by natural condition and by
 reflection, will sooner incline to this advice than active and busy souls,
 which embrace: all, engage in all, are hot upon everything, which offer,
 present, and give themselves up to every occasion. We are to use these
 accidental and extraneous commodities, so far as they are pleasant to us,
 but by no means to lay our principal foundation there; 'tis no true one;
 neither nature nor reason allows it so to be. Why therefore should we,
 contrary to their laws, enslave our own contentment to the power of
 another? To anticipate also the accidents of fortune, to deprive ourselves
 of the conveniences we have in our own power, as several have done upon
 the account of devotion, and some philosophers by reasoning; to be one's
 own servant, to lie hard, to put out our own eyes, to throw our wealth
 into the river, to go in search of grief; these, by the misery of this
 life, aiming at bliss in another; those by laying themselves low to avoid
 the danger of falling: all such are acts of an excessive virtue. The
 stoutest and most resolute natures render even their seclusion glorious
 and exemplary:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tuta et parvula laudo,
 Quum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis
 Verum, ubi quid melius contingit et unctius, idem
 Hos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum
 Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis."

 ["When means are deficient, I laud a safe and humble condition,
 content with little: but when things grow better and more easy, I
 all the same say that you alone are wise and live well, whose
 invested money is visible in beautiful villas."
 ?Horace, Ep., i. 15, 42.]
</pre>
 <p>
 A great deal less would serve my turn well enough. 'Tis enough for me,
 under fortune's favour, to prepare myself for her disgrace, and, being at
 my ease, to represent to myself, as far as my imagination can stretch, the
 ill to come; as we do at jousts and tiltings, where we counterfeit war in
 the greatest calm of peace. I do not think Arcesilaus the philosopher the
 less temperate and virtuous for knowing that he made use of gold and
 silver vessels, when the condition of his fortune allowed him so to do; I
 have indeed a better opinion of him than if he had denied himself what he
 used with liberality and moderation. I see the utmost limits of natural
 necessity: and considering a poor man begging at my door, ofttimes more
 jocund and more healthy than I myself am, I put myself into his place, and
 attempt to dress my mind after his mode; and running, in like manner, over
 other examples, though I fancy death, poverty, contempt, and sickness
 treading on my heels, I easily resolve not to be affrighted, forasmuch as
 a less than I takes them with so much patience; and am not willing to
 believe that a less understanding can do more than a greater, or that the
 effects of precept cannot arrive to as great a height as those of custom.
 And knowing of how uncertain duration these accidental conveniences are, I
 never forget, in the height of all my enjoyments, to make it my chiefest
 prayer to Almighty God, that He will please to render me content with
 myself and the condition wherein I am. I see young men very gay and
 frolic, who nevertheless keep a mass of pills in their trunk at home, to
 take when they've got a cold, which they fear so much the less, because
 they think they have remedy at hand. Every one should do in like manner,
 and, moreover, if they find themselves subject to some more violent
 disease, should furnish themselves with such medicines as may numb and
 stupefy the part.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The employment a man should choose for such a life ought neither to be a
 laborious nor an unpleasing one; otherwise 'tis to no purpose at all to be
 retired. And this depends upon every one's liking and humour. Mine has no
 manner of complacency for husbandry, and such as love it ought to apply
 themselves to it with moderation:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Endeavour to make circumstances subject to me,
 and not me subject to circumstances."
 ?Horace, Ep., i. i, 19.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Husbandry is otherwise a very servile employment, as Sallust calls it;
 though some parts of it are more excusable than the rest, as the care of
 gardens, which Xenophon attributes to Cyrus; and a mean may be found out
 betwixt the sordid and low application, so full of perpetual solicitude,
 which is seen in men who make it their entire business and study, and the
 stupid and extreme negligence, letting all things go at random which we
 see in others
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Democriti pecus edit agellos
 Cultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox."

 soaring mind ranges abroad without the body."

</pre>
 <p>
 But let us hear what advice the younger Pliny gives his friend Caninius
 Rufus upon the subject of solitude: "I advise thee, in the full and
 plentiful retirement wherein thou art, to leave to thy hinds the care of
 thy husbandry, and to addict thyself to the study of letters, to extract
 from thence something that may be entirely and absolutely thine own." By
 which he means reputation; like Cicero, who says that he would employ his
 solitude and retirement from public affairs to acquire by his writings an
 immortal life.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Usque adeone
 Scire tuum, nihil est, nisi to scire hoc, sciat alter?"

 ["Is all that thy learning nothing, unless another knows
 that thou knowest?"?Persius, Sat., i. 23.]
</pre>
 <p>
 It appears to be reason, when a man talks of retiring from the world, that
 he should look quite out of [for] himself. These do it but by halves: they
 design well enough for themselves when they shall be no more in it; but
 still they pretend to extract the fruits of that design from the world,
 when absent from it, by a ridiculous contradiction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The imagination of those who seek solitude upon the account of devotion,
 filling their hopes and courage with certainty of divine promises in the
 other life, is much more rationally founded. They propose to themselves
 God, an infinite object in goodness and power; the soul has there
 wherewithal, at full liberty, to satiate her desires: afflictions and
 sufferings turn to their advantage, being undergone for the acquisition of
 eternal health and joy; death is to be wished and longed for, where it is
 the passage to so perfect a condition; the asperity of the rules they
 impose upon themselves is immediately softened by custom, and all their
 carnal appetites baffled and subdued, by refusing to humour and feed them,
 these being only supported by use and exercise. This sole end of another
 happily immortal life is that which really merits that we should abandon
 the pleasures and conveniences of this; and he who can really and
 constantly inflame his soul with the ardour of this vivid faith and hope,
 erects for himself in solitude a more voluptuous and delicious life than
 any other sort of existence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Neither the end, then, nor the means of this advice pleases me, for we
 often fall out of the frying-pan into the fire.?[or: we always
 relapse ill from fever into fever.]?This book-employment is as
 painful as any other, and as great an enemy to health, which ought to be
 the first thing considered; neither ought a man to be allured with the
 pleasure of it, which is the same that destroys the frugal, the
 avaricious, the voluptuous, and the ambitious man.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["This plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other,
 and as great an enemie vnto health, which ought principally to be
 considered. And a man should not suffer him selfe to be inveagled
 by the pleasure he takes in them."?Florio, edit. 1613, p. 122.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The sages give us caution enough to beware the treachery of our desires,
 and to distinguish true and entire pleasures from such as are mixed and
 complicated with greater pain. For the most of our pleasures, say they,
 wheedle and caress only to strangle us, like those thieves the Egyptians
 called Philistae; if the headache should come before drunkenness, we
 should have a care of drinking too much; but pleasure, to deceive us,
 marches before and conceals her train. Books are pleasant, but if, by
 being over-studious, we impair our health and spoil our goodhumour, the
 best pieces we have, let us give it over; I, for my part, am one of those
 who think, that no fruit derived from them can recompense so great a loss.
 As men who have long felt themselves weakened by indisposition, give
 themselves up at last to the mercy of medicine and submit to certain rules
 of living, which they are for the future never to transgress; so he who
 retires, weary of and disgusted with the common way of living, ought to
 model this new one he enters into by the rules of reason, and to institute
 and establish it by premeditation and reflection. He ought to have taken
 leave of all sorts of labour, what advantage soever it may promise, and
 generally to have shaken off all those passions which disturb the
 tranquillity of body and soul, and then choose the way that best suits
 with his own humour:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Unusquisque sua noverit ire via."
</pre>
 <p>
 In husbandry, study, hunting, and all other exercises, men are to proceed
 to the utmost limits of pleasure, but must take heed of engaging further,
 where trouble begins to mix with it. We are to reserve so much employment
 only as is necessary to keep us in breath and to defend us from the
 inconveniences that the other extreme of a dull and stupid laziness brings
 along with it. There are sterile knotty sciences, chiefly hammered out for
 the crowd; let such be left to them who are engaged in the world's
 service. I for my part care for no other books, but either such as are
 pleasant and easy, to amuse me, or those that comfort and instruct me how
 to regulate my life and death:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tacitum sylvas inter reptare salubres,
 Curantem, quidquid dignum sapienti bonoque est."

 ["Silently meditating in the healthy groves, whatever is worthy
 of a wise and good man."?Horace, Ep., i. 4, 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Wiser men, having great force and vigour of soul, may propose to
 themselves a rest wholly spiritual but for me, who have a very ordinary
 soul, it is very necessary to support myself with bodily conveniences; and
 age having of late deprived me of those pleasures that were more
 acceptable to me, I instruct and whet my appetite to those that remain,
 more suitable to this other reason. We ought to hold with all our force,
 both of hands and teeth, the use of the pleasures of life that our years,
 one after another, snatch away from us:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Carpamus dulcia; nostrum est,
 Quod vivis; cinis, et manes, et fabula fies."

 ["Let us pluck life's sweets, 'tis for them we live: by and by we
 shall be ashes, a ghost, a mere subject of talk."
 ?Persius, Sat., v. 151.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Now, as to the end that Pliny and Cicero propose to us of glory, 'tis
 infinitely wide of my account. Ambition is of all others the most contrary
 humour to solitude; glory and repose are things that cannot possibly
 inhabit in one and the same place. For so much as I understand, these have
 only their arms and legs disengaged from the crowd; their soul and
 intention remain confined behind more than ever:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tun', vetule, auriculis alienis colligis escas?"

 ["Dost thou, then, old man, collect food for others' ears?"
 ?Persius, Sat., i. 22.]
</pre>
 <p>
 they have only retired to take a better leap, and by a stronger motion to
 give a brisker charge into the crowd. Will you see how they shoot short?
 Let us put into the counterpoise the advice of two philosophers, of two
 very different sects, writing, the one to Idomeneus, the other to
 Lucilius, their friends, to retire into solitude from worldly honours and
 affairs. "You have," say they, "hitherto lived swimming and floating; come
 now and die in the harbour: you have given the first part of your life to
 the light, give what remains to the shade. It is impossible to give over
 business, if you do not also quit the fruit; therefore disengage
 yourselves from all concern of name and glory; 'tis to be feared the
 lustre of your former actions will give you but too much light, and follow
 you into your most private retreat. Quit with other pleasures that which
 proceeds from the approbation of another man: and as to your knowledge and
 parts, never concern yourselves; they will not lose their effect if
 yourselves be the better for them. Remember him, who being asked why he
 took so much pains in an art that could come to the knowledge of but few
 persons? 'A few are enough for me,' replied he; 'I have enough with one; I
 have enough with never an one.'?[Seneca, Ep., 7.]?He said
 true; you and a companion are theatre enough to one another, or you to
 yourself. Let the people be to you one, and be you one to the whole
 people. 'Tis an unworthy ambition to think to derive glory from a man's
 sloth and privacy: you are to do like the beasts of chase, who efface the
 track at the entrance into their den. You are no more to concern yourself
 how the world talks of you, but how you are to talk to yourself. Retire
 yourself into yourself, but first prepare yourself there to receive
 yourself: it were a folly to trust yourself in your own hands, if you
 cannot govern yourself. A man may miscarry alone as well as in company.
 Till you have rendered yourself one before whom you dare not trip, and
 till you have a bashfulness and respect for yourself,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Obversentur species honestae animo;"

 ["Let honest things be ever present to the mind"
 ?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 22.]
</pre>
 <p>
 present continually to your imagination Cato, Phocion, and Aristides, in
 whose presence the fools themselves will hide their faults, and make them
 controllers of all your intentions; should these deviate from virtue, your
 respect to those will set you right; they will keep you in this way to be
 contented with yourself; to borrow nothing of any other but yourself; to
 stay and fix your soul in certain and limited thoughts, wherein she may
 please herself, and having understood the true and real goods, which men
 the more enjoy the more they understand, to rest satisfied, without desire
 of prolongation of life or name." This is the precept of the true and
 natural philosophy, not of a boasting and prating philosophy, such as that
 of the two former.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXXIX??A CONSIDERATION UPON CICERO
 </h2>
 <p>
 One word more by way of comparison betwixt these two. There are to be
 gathered out of the writings of Cicero and the younger Pliny (but little,
 in my opinion, resembling his uncle in his humours) infinite testimonies
 of a beyond measure ambitious nature; and amongst others, this for one,
 that they both, in the sight of all the world, solicit the historians of
 their time not to forget them in their memoirs; and fortune, as if in
 spite, has made the vanity of those requests live upon record down to this
 age of ours, while she has long since consigned the histories themselves
 to oblivion. But this exceeds all meanness of spirit in persons of such a
 quality as they were, to think to derive any great renown from babbling
 and prating; even to the publishing of their private letters to their
 friends, and so withal, that though some of them were never sent, the
 opportunity being lost, they nevertheless presented them to the light,
 with this worthy excuse that they were unwilling to lose their labours and
 lucubrations. Was it not very well becoming two consuls of Rome, sovereign
 magistrates of the republic that commanded the world, to spend their
 leisure in contriving quaint and elegant missives, thence to gain the
 reputation of being versed in their own mother-tongues? What could a
 pitiful schoolmaster have done worse, whose trade it was thereby to get
 his living? If the acts of Xenophon and Caesar had not far transcended
 their eloquence, I scarce believe they would ever have taken the pains to
 have written them; they made it their business to recommend not their
 speaking, but their doing. And could the perfection of eloquence have
 added a lustre suitable to a great personage, certainly Scipio and Laelius
 had never resigned the honour of their comedies, with all the luxuriances
 and elegances of the Latin tongue, to an African slave; for that the work
 was theirs, its beauty and excellence sufficiently declare; Terence
 himself confesses as much, and I should take it ill from any one that
 would dispossess me of that belief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis a kind of mockery and offence to extol a man for qualities
 misbecoming his condition, though otherwise commendable in themselves, but
 such as ought not, however, to be his chief talent; as if a man should
 commend a king for being a good painter, a good architect, a good
 marksman, or a good runner at the ring: commendations that add no honour,
 unless mentioned altogether and in the train of those that are properly
 applicable to him, namely, justice and the science of governing and
 conducting his people both in peace and war. At this rate, agriculture was
 an honour to Cyrus, and eloquence and the knowledge of letters to
 Charlemagne. I have in my time known some, who by writing acquired both
 their titles and fortune, disown their apprenticeship, corrupt their
 style, and affect ignorance in so vulgar a quality (which also our nation
 holds to be rarely seen in very learned hands), and to seek a reputation
 by better qualities. Demosthenes' companions in the embassy to Philip,
 extolling that prince as handsome, eloquent, and a stout drinker,
 Demosthenes said that those were commendations more proper for a woman, an
 advocate, or a sponge, than for a king':

 Plutarch says, moreover, that to appear so excellent in these less
 necessary qualities is to produce witness against a man's self, that he
 has spent his time and applied his study ill, which ought to have been
 employed in the acquisition of more necessary and more useful things. So
 that Philip, king of Macedon, having heard that great Alexander his son
 sing once at a feast to the wonder of the best musicians there: "Art thou
 not ashamed," said he to him, "to sing so well?" And to the same Philip a
 musician, with whom he was disputing about some things concerning his art:
 "Heaven forbid, sir," said he, "that so great a misfortune should ever
 befall you as to understand these things better than I." A king should be
 able to answer as Iphicrates did the orator, who pressed upon him in his
 invective after this manner: "And what art thou that thou bravest it at
 this rate? art thou a man at arms, art thou an archer, art thou a
 pikeman?"?"I am none of all this; but I know how to command all
 these." And Antisthenes took it for an argument of little value in
 Ismenias that he was commended for playing excellently well upon a flute.

 <p>
 I know very well, that when I hear any one dwell upon the language of my
 essays, I had rather a great deal he would say nothing: 'tis not so much
 to elevate the style as to depress the sense, and so much the more
 offensively as they do it obliquely; and yet I am much deceived if many
 other writers deliver more worth noting as to the matter, and, how well or
 ill soever, if any other writer has sown things much more materials or at
 all events more downright, upon his paper than myself. To bring the more
 in, I only muster up the heads; should I annex the sequel, I should trebly
 multiply the volume. And how many stories have I scattered up and down in
 this book that I only touch upon, which, should any one more curiously
 search into, they would find matter enough to produce infinite essays.
 Neither those stories nor my quotations always serve simply for example,
 authority, or ornament; I do not only regard them for the use I make of
 them: they carry sometimes besides what I apply them to, the seed of a
 more rich and a bolder matter, and sometimes, collaterally, a more
 delicate sound both to myself who will say no more about it in this place,
 and to others who shall be of my humour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But returning to the speaking virtue: I find no great choice betwixt not
 knowing to speak anything but ill, and not knowing to speak anything but
 well.

 The sages tell us that, as to what concerns knowledge, 'tis nothing but
 philosophy; and as to what concerns effects, nothing but virtue, which is
 generally proper to all degrees and to all orders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There is something like this in these two other philosophers, for they
 also promise eternity to the letters they write to their friends; but 'tis
 after another manner, and by accommodating themselves, for a good end, to
 the vanity of another; for they write to them that if the concern of
 making themselves known to future ages, and the thirst of glory, do yet
 detain them in the management of public affairs, and make them fear the
 solitude and retirement to which they would persuade them, let them never
 trouble themselves more about it, forasmuch as they shall have credit
 enough with posterity to ensure them that were there nothing else but the
 letters thus written to them, those letters will render their names as
 known and famous as their own public actions could do. And besides this
 difference, these are not idle and empty letters, that contain nothing but
 a fine jingle of well-chosen words and delicate couched phrases, but
 rather replete and abounding with grand discourses of reason, by which a
 man may render himself not more eloquent, but more wise, and that instruct
 us not to speak, but to do well. Away with that eloquence that enchants us
 with itself, and not with actual things! unless you will allow that of
 Cicero to be of so supreme a perfection as to form a complete body of
 itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I shall farther add one story we read of him to this purpose, wherein his
 nature will much more manifestly be laid open to us. He was to make an
 oration in public, and found himself a little straitened for time to make
 himself ready at his ease; when Eros, one of his slaves, brought him word
 that the audience was deferred till the next day, at which he was so
 ravished with joy that he enfranchised him for the good news.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this subject of letters, I will add this more to what has been
 already said, that it is a kind of writing wherein my friends think I can
 do something; and I am willing to confess I should rather have chosen to
 publish my whimsies that way than any other, had I had to whom to write;
 but I wanted such a settled intercourse, as I once had, to attract me to
 it, to raise my fancy, and to support me. For to traffic with the wind, as
 some others have done, and to forge vain names to direct my letters to, in
 a serious subject, I could never do it but in a dream, being a sworn enemy
 to all manner of falsification. I should have been more diligent and more
 confident had I had a judicious and indulgent friend whom to address, than
 thus to expose myself to the various judgments of a whole people, and I am
 deceived if I had not succeeded better. I have naturally a humorous and
 familiar style; but it is a style of my own, not proper for public
 business, but, like the language I speak, too compact, irregular, abrupt,
 and singular; and as to letters of ceremony that have no other substance
 than a fine contexture of courteous words, I am wholly to seek. I have
 neither faculty nor relish for those tedious tenders of service and
 affection; I believe little in them from others, and I should not forgive
 myself should I say to others more than I myself believe. 'Tis, doubtless,
 very remote from the present practice; for there never was so abject and
 servile prostitution of offers: life, soul, devotion, adoration, vassal,
 slave, and I cannot tell what, as now; all which expressions are so
 commonly and so indifferently posted to and fro by every one and to every
 one, that when they would profess a greater and more respectful
 inclination upon more just occasions, they have not wherewithal to express
 it. I mortally hate all air of flattery, which is the cause that I
 naturally fall into a shy, rough, and crude way of speaking, that, to such
 as do not know me, may seem a little to relish of disdain. I honour those
 most to whom I show the least honour, and where my soul moves with the
 greatest cheerfulness, I easily forget the ceremonies of look and gesture,
 and offer myself faintly and bluntly to them to whom I am the most
 devoted: methinks they should read it in my heart, and that the expression
 of my words does but injure the love I have conceived within. To welcome,
 take leave, give thanks, accost, offer my service, and such verbal
 formalities as the ceremonious laws of our modern civility enjoin, I know
 no man so stupidly unprovided of language as myself; and I have never been
 employed in writing letters of favour and recommendation, that he, in
 whose behalf it was written, did not think my mediation cold and
 imperfect. The Italians are great printers of letters; I do believe I have
 at least an hundred several volumes of them; of all which those of
 Annibale Caro seem to me to be the best. If all the paper I have scribbled
 to the ladies at the time when my hand was really prompted by my passion,
 were now in being, there might, peradventure, be found a page worthy to be
 communicated to our young inamoratos, that are besotted with that fury. I
 always write my letters post-haste?so precipitately, that though I
 write intolerably ill, I rather choose to do it myself, than to employ
 another; for I can find none able to follow me: and I never transcribe
 any. I have accustomed the great ones who know me to endure my blots and
 dashes, and upon paper without fold or margin. Those that cost me the most
 pains, are the worst; when I once begin to draw it in by head and
 shoulders, 'tis a sign that I am not there. I fall too without
 premeditation or design; the first word begets the second, and so to the
 end of the chapter. The letters of this age consist more in fine edges and
 prefaces than in matter. Just as I had rather write two letters than close
 and fold up one, and always assign that employment to some other, so, when
 the real business of my letter is dispatched, I would with all my heart
 transfer it to another hand to add those long harangues, offers, and
 prayers, that we place at the bottom, and should be glad that some new
 custom would discharge us of that trouble; as also of superscribing them
 with a long legend of qualities and titles, which for fear of mistakes, I
 have often not written at all, and especially to men of the long robe and
 finance; there are so many new offices, such a dispensation and ordering
 of titles of honour, that 'tis hard to set them forth aright yet, being so
 dearly bought, they are neither to be altered nor forgotten without
 offence. I find it equally in bad taste to encumber the fronts and
 inscriptions of the books we commit to the press with such.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XL??THAT THE RELISH FOR GOOD AND EVIL DEPENDS IN GREAT
 MEASURE UPON THE OPINION WE HAVE OF THEM
 </h2>
 <p>
 Men (says an ancient Greek sentence)?[Manual of Epictetus, c. 10.]?
 are tormented with the opinions they have of things and not by the things
 themselves. It were a great victory obtained for the relief of our
 miserable human condition, could this proposition be established for
 certain and true throughout. For if evils have no admission into us but by
 the judgment we ourselves make of them, it should seem that it is, then,
 in our own power to despise them or to turn them to good. If things
 surrender themselves to our mercy, why do we not convert and accommodate
 them to our advantage? If what we call evil and torment is neither evil
 nor torment of itself, but only that our fancy gives it that quality, it
 is in us to change it, and it being in our own choice, if there be no
 constraint upon us, we must certainly be very strange fools to take arms
 for that side which is most offensive to us, and to give sickness, want,
 and contempt a bitter and nauseous taste, if it be in our power to give
 them a pleasant relish, and if, fortune simply providing the matter, 'tis
 for us to give it the form. Now, that what we call evil is not so of
 itself, or at least to that degree that we make it, and that it depends
 upon us to give it another taste and complexion (for all comes to one),
 let us examine how that can be maintained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If the original being of those things we fear had power to lodge itself in
 us by its own authority, it would then lodge itself alike, and in like
 manner, in all; for men are all of the same kind, and saving in greater
 and less proportions, are all provided with the same utensils and
 instruments to conceive and to judge; but the diversity of opinions we
 have of those things clearly evidences that they only enter us by
 composition; one person, peradventure, admits them in their true being,
 but a thousand others give them a new and contrary being in them. We hold
 death, poverty, and pain for our principal enemies; now, this death, which
 some repute the most dreadful of all dreadful things, who does not know
 that others call it the only secure harbour from the storms and tempests
 of life, the sovereign good of nature, the sole support of liberty, and
 the common and prompt remedy of all evils? And as the one expect it with
 fear and trembling, the others support it with greater ease than life.
 That one complains of its facility:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Mors! utinam pavidos vitae subducere nolles.
 Sed virtus to sola daret!"

 ["O death! wouldst that thou might spare the coward, but that
 valour alone should pay thee tribute."?Lucan, iv. 580.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Now, let us leave these boastful courages. Theodorus answered Lysimachus,
 who threatened to kill him, "Thou wilt do a brave feat," said he, "to
 attain the force of a cantharides." The majority of philosophers are
 observed to have either purposely anticipated, or hastened and assisted
 their own death. How many ordinary people do we see led to execution, and
 that not to a simple death, but mixed with shame and sometimes with
 grievous torments, appear with such assurance, whether through firm
 courage or natural simplicity, that a man can discover no change from
 their ordinary condition; settling their domestic affairs, commending
 themselves to their friends, singing, preaching, and addressing the
 people, nay, sometimes sallying into jests, and drinking to their
 companions, quite as well as Socrates?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One that they were leading to the gallows told them they must not take him
 through such a street, lest a merchant who lived there should arrest him
 by the way for an old debt. Another told the hangman he must not touch his
 neck for fear of making him laugh, he was so ticklish. Another answered
 his confessor, who promised him he should that day sup with our Lord, "Do
 you go then," said he, "in my room [place]; for I for my part keep fast
 to-day." Another having called for drink, and the hangman having drunk
 first, said he would not drink after him, for fear of catching some evil
 disease. Everybody has heard the tale of the Picard, to whom, being upon
 the ladder, they presented a common wench, telling him (as our law does
 some times permit) that if he would marry her they would save his life;
 he, having a while considered her and perceiving that she halted: "Come,
 tie up, tie up," said he, "she limps." And they tell another story of the
 same kind of a fellow in Denmark, who being condemned to lose his head,
 and the like condition being proposed to him upon the scaffold, refused
 it, by reason the girl they offered him had hollow cheeks and too sharp a
 nose. A servant at Toulouse being accused of heresy, for the sum of his
 belief referred himself to that of his master, a young student, prisoner
 with him, choosing rather to die than suffer himself to be persuaded that
 his master could err. We read that of the inhabitants of Arras, when Louis
 XI. took that city, a great many let themselves be hanged rather than they
 would say, "God save the King." And amongst that mean-souled race of men,
 the buffoons, there have been some who would not leave their fooling at
 the very moment of death. One that the hang man was turning off the ladder
 cried: "Launch the galley," an ordinary saying of his. Another, whom at
 the point of death his friends had laid upon a bed of straw before the
 fire, the physician asking him where his pain lay: "Betwixt the bench and
 the fire," said he, and the priest, to give him extreme unction, groping
 for his feet which his pain had made him pull up to him: "You will find
 them," said he, "at the end of my legs." To one who being present exhorted
 him to recommend himself to God: "Why, who goes thither?" said he; and the
 other replying: "It will presently be yourself, if it be His good
 pleasure." "Shall I be sure to be there by to-morrow night?" said he. "Do,
 but recommend yourself to Him," said the other, "and you will soon be
 there." "I were best then," said he, "to carry my recommendations myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the kingdom of Narsingah to this day the wives of their priests are
 buried alive with the bodies of their husbands; all other wives are burnt
 at their husbands' funerals, which they not only firmly but cheerfully
 undergo. At the death of their king, his wives and concubines, his
 favourites, all his officers, and domestic servants, who make up a whole
 people, present themselves so gaily to the fire where his body is burnt,
 that they seem to take it for a singular honour to accompany their master
 in death. During our late wars of Milan, where there happened so many
 takings and retakings of towns, the people, impatient of so many changes
 of fortune, took such a resolution to die, that I have heard my father say
 he there saw a list taken of five-and-twenty masters of families who made
 themselves away in one week's time: an incident somewhat resembling that
 of the Xanthians, who being besieged by Brutus, fell?men, women, and
 children?into such a furious appetite of dying, that nothing can be
 done to evade death which they did not to avoid life; insomuch that Brutus
 had much difficulty in saving a very small number.?["Only fifty were
 saved."?Plutarch, Life of Brutus, c. 8.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every opinion is of force enough to cause itself to be espoused at the
 expense of life. The first article of that valiant oath that Greece took
 and observed in the Median war, was that every one should sooner exchange
 life for death, than their own laws for those of Persia. What a world of
 people do we see in the wars betwixt the Turks and the Greeks, rather
 embrace a cruel death than uncircumcise themselves to admit of baptism? An
 example of which no sort of religion is incapable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The kings of Castile having banished the Jews out of their dominions,
 John, King of Portugal, in consideration of eight crowns a head, sold them
 a retreat into his for a certain limited time, upon condition that the
 time fixed coming to expire they should begone, and he to furnish them
 with shipping to transport them into Africa. The day comes, which once
 lapsed they were given to understand that such as were afterward found in
 the kingdom should remain slaves; vessels were very slenderly provided;
 and those who embarked in them were rudely and villainously used by the
 passengers, who, besides other indignities, kept them cruising upon the
 sea, one while forwards and another backwards, till they had spent all
 their provisions, and were constrained to buy of them at so dear a rate
 and so long withal, that they set them not on shore till they were all
 stripped to the very shirts. The news of this inhuman usage being brought
 to those who remained behind, the greater part of them resolved upon
 slavery and some made a show of changing religion. Emmanuel, the successor
 of John, being come to the crown, first set them at liberty, and
 afterwards altering his mind, ordered them to depart his country,
 assigning three ports for their passage. He hoped, says Bishop Osorius, no
 contemptible Latin historian of these later times, that the favour of the
 liberty he had given them having failed of converting them to
 Christianity, yet the difficulty of committing themselves to the mercy of
 the mariners and of abandoning a country they were now habituated to and
 were grown very rich in, to go and expose themselves in strange and
 unknown regions, would certainly do it. But finding himself deceived in
 his expectation, and that they were all resolved upon the voyage, he cut
 off two of the three ports he had promised them, to the end that the
 length and incommodity of the passage might reduce some, or that he might
 have opportunity, by crowding them all into one place, the more
 conveniently to execute what he had designed, which was to force all the
 children under fourteen years of age from the arms of their fathers and
 mothers, to transport them from their sight and conversation, into a place
 where they might be instructed and brought up in our religion. He says
 that this produced a most horrid spectacle the natural affection betwixt
 the parents and their children, and moreover their zeal to their ancient
 belief, contending against this violent decree, fathers and mothers were
 commonly seen making themselves away, and by a yet much more rigorous
 example, precipitating out of love and compassion their young children
 into wells and pits, to avoid the severity of this law. As to the
 remainder of them, the time that had been prefixed being expired, for want
 of means to transport them they again returned into slavery. Some also
 turned Christians, upon whose faith, as also that of their posterity, even
 to this day, which is a hundred years since, few Portuguese can yet rely;
 though custom and length of time are much more powerful counsellors in
 such changes than all other constraints whatever. In the town of
 Castelnaudari, fifty heretic Albigeois at one time suffered themselves to
 be burned alive in one fire rather than they would renounce their
 opinions.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quoties non modo ductores nostri, sed universi etiam exercitus,
 ad non dubiam mortem concurrerunt?"

 ["How often have not only our leaders, but whole armies, run to a
 certain and manifest death."?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., i. 37.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I have seen an intimate friend of mine run headlong upon death with a real
 affection, and that was rooted in his heart by divers plausible arguments
 which he would never permit me to dispossess him of, and upon the first
 honourable occasion that offered itself to him, precipitate himself into
 it, without any manner of visible reason, with an obstinate and ardent
 desire of dying. We have several examples in our own times of persons,
 even young children, who for fear of some little inconvenience have
 despatched themselves. And what shall we not fear, says one of the
 ancients?[Seneca, Ep., 70.]?to this purpose, if we dread that
 which cowardice itself has chosen for its refuge?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Should I here produce a long catalogue of those, of all sexes and
 conditions and sects, even in the most happy ages, who have either with
 great constancy looked death in the face, or voluntarily sought it, and
 sought it not only to avoid the evils of this life, but some purely to
 avoid the satiety of living, and others for the hope of a better condition
 elsewhere, I should never have done. Nay, the number is so infinite that
 in truth I should have a better bargain on't to reckon up those who have
 feared it. This one therefore shall serve for all: Pyrrho the philosopher
 being one day in a boat in a very great tempest, shewed to those he saw
 the most affrighted about him, and encouraged them, by the example of a
 hog that was there, nothing at all concerned at the storm. Shall we then
 dare to say that this advantage of reason, of which we so much boast, and
 upon the account of which we think ourselves masters and emperors over the
 rest of all creation, was given us for a torment? To what end serves the
 knowledge of things if it renders us more unmanly? if we thereby lose the
 tranquillity and repose we should enjoy without it? and if it put us into
 a worse condition than Pyrrho's hog? Shall we employ the understanding
 that was conferred upon us for our greatest good to our own ruin; setting
 ourselves against the design of nature and the universal order of things,
 which intend that every one should make use of the faculties, members, and
 means he has to his own best advantage?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it may, peradventure, be objected against me: Your rule is true enough
 as to what concerns death; but what will you say of indigence? What will
 you, moreover, say of pain, which Aristippus, Hieronimus, and most of the
 sages have reputed the worst of evils; and those who have denied it by
 word of mouth have, however, confessed it in effect? Posidonius being
 extremely tormented with a sharp and painful disease, Pompeius came to
 visit him, excusing himself that he had taken so unseasonable a time to
 come to hear him discourse of philosophy. "The gods forbid," said
 Posidonius to him, "that pain should ever have the power to hinder me from
 talking," and thereupon fell immediately upon a discourse of the contempt
 of pain: but, in the meantime, his own infirmity was playing his part, and
 plagued him to purpose; to which he cried out, "Thou mayest work thy will,
 pain, and torment me with all the power thou hast, but thou shalt never
 make me say that thou art an evil." This story that they make such a
 clutter withal, what has it to do, I fain would know, with the contempt of
 pain? He only fights it with words, and in the meantime, if the shootings
 and dolours he felt did not move him, why did he interrupt his discourse?
 Why did he fancy he did so great a thing in forbearing to confess it an
 evil? All does not here consist in the imagination; our fancies may work
 upon other things: but here is the certain science that is playing its
 part, of which our senses themselves are judges:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Qui nisi sunt veri, ratio quoque falsa sit omnis."

 ["Which, if they be not true, all reasoning may also be false.
 ?"Lucretius, iv. 486.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Shall we persuade our skins that the jerks of a whip agreeably tickle us,
 or our taste that a potion of aloes is vin de Graves? Pyrrho's hog is here
 in the same predicament with us; he is not afraid of death, 'tis true, but
 if you beat him he will cry out to some purpose. Shall we force the
 general law of nature, which in every living creature under heaven is seen
 to tremble under pain? The very trees seem to groan under the blows they
 receive. Death is only felt by reason, forasmuch as it is the motion of an
 instant;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aut fuit, aut veniet; nihil est praesentis in illa."

 ["Death has been, or will come: there is nothing of the present in
 it."?Estienne de la Boetie, Satires.]

 "Morsque minus poenae, quam mora mortis, habet;"

 ["The delay of death is more painful than death itself."
 ?Ovid, Ep. Ariadne to Theseus, v. 42.]
</pre>
 <p>
 a thousand beasts, a thousand men, are sooner dead than threatened. That
 also which we principally pretend to fear in death is pain, its ordinary
 forerunner: yet, if we may believe a holy father:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Malam mortem non facit, nisi quod sequitur mortem."

 ["That which follows death makes death bad."
 ?St. Augustin, De Civit. Dei, i. ii.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And I should yet say, more probably, that neither that which goes before
 nor that which follows after is at all of the appurtenances of death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We excuse ourselves falsely: and I find by experience that it is rather
 the impatience of the imagination of death that makes us impatient of
 pain, and that we find it doubly grievous as it threatens us with death.
 But reason accusing our cowardice for fearing a thing so sudden, so
 inevitable, and so insensible, we take the other as the more excusable
 pretence. All ills that carry no other danger along with them but simply
 the evils themselves, we treat as things of no danger: the toothache or
 the gout, painful as they are, yet being not reputed mortal, who reckons
 them in the catalogue of diseases?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But let us presuppose that in death we principally regard the pain; as
 also there is nothing to be feared in poverty but the miseries it brings
 along with it of thirst, hunger, cold, heat, watching, and the other
 inconveniences it makes us suffer, still we have nothing to do with
 anything but pain. I will grant, and very willingly, that it is the worst
 incident of our being (for I am the man upon earth who the most hates and
 avoids it, considering that hitherto, I thank God, I have had so little
 traffic with it), but still it is in us, if not to annihilate, at least to
 lessen it by patience; and though the body and the reason should mutiny,
 to maintain the soul, nevertheless, in good condition. Were it not so, who
 had ever given reputation to virtue; valour, force, magnanimity, and
 resolution? where were their parts to be played if there were no pain to
 be defied?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Avida est periculi virtus."

 Were there no lying upon the hard ground, no enduring, armed at all
 points, the meridional heats, no feeding upon the flesh of horses and
 asses, no seeing a man's self hacked and hewed to pieces, no suffering a
 bullet to be pulled out from amongst the shattered bones, no sewing up,
 cauterising and searching of wounds, by what means were the advantage we
 covet to have over the vulgar to be acquired? 'Tis far from flying evil
 and pain, what the sages say, that of actions equally good, a man should
 most covet to perform that wherein there is greater labour and pain.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non est enim hilaritate, nec lascivia, nec risu, aut joco
 comite levitatis, sed saepe etiam tristes firmitate et

 and jesting, the companion of levity, but ofttimes the serious sort
 reap felicity from their firmness and constancy."
 ?Cicero, De Finib. ii. 10.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And for this reason it has ever been impossible to persuade our
 forefathers but that the victories obtained by dint of force and the
 hazard of war were not more honourable than those performed in great
 security by stratagem or practice:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Laetius est, quoties magno sibi constat honestum."

 ["A good deed is all the more a satisfaction by how much the more
 it has cost us"?Lucan, ix. 404.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Besides, this ought to be our comfort, that naturally, if the pain be
 violent, 'tis but short; and if long, nothing violent:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si gravis, brevis;
 Si longus, levis."
</pre>
 <p>
 Thou wilt not feel it long if thou feelest it too much; it will either put
 an end to itself or to thee; it comes to the same thing; if thou canst not
 support it, it will export thee:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Remember that the greatest pains are terminated by death; that
 slighter pains have long intermissions of repose, and that we are
 masters of the more moderate sort: so that, if they be tolerable,
 we bear them; if not, we can go out of life, as from a theatre, when
 it does not please us"?Cicero, De Finib. i. 15.]
</pre>

 That which makes us suffer pain with so much impatience is the not being
 accustomed to repose our chiefest contentment in the soul; that we do not
 enough rely upon her who is the sole and sovereign mistress of our
 condition. The body, saving in the greater or less proportion, has but one
 and the same bent and bias; whereas the soul is variable into all sorts of
 forms; and subject to herself and to her own empire, all things
 whatsoever, both the senses of the body and all other accidents: and
 therefore it is that we ought to study her, to inquire into her, and to
 rouse up all her powerful faculties. There is neither reason, force, nor
 prescription that can anything prevail against her inclination and choice.
 Of so many thousands of biases that she has at her disposal, let us give
 her one proper to our repose and conversation, and then we shall not only
 be sheltered and secured from all manner of injury and offence, but
 moreover gratified and obliged, if she will, with evils and offences. She
 makes her profit indifferently of all things; error, dreams, serve her to
 good use, as loyal matter to lodge us in safety and contentment. 'Tis
 plain enough to be seen that 'tis the sharpness of our mind that gives the
 edge to our pains and pleasures: beasts that have no such thing, leave to
 their bodies their own free and natural sentiments, and consequently in
 every kind very near the same, as appears by the resembling application of
 their motions. If we would not disturb in our members the jurisdiction
 that appertains to them in this, 'tis to be believed it would be the
 better for us, and that nature has given them a just and moderate temper
 both to pleasure and pain; neither can it fail of being just, being equal
 and common. But seeing we have enfranchised ourselves from her rules to
 give ourselves up to the rambling liberty of our own fancies, let us at
 least help to incline them to the most agreeable side. Plato fears our too
 vehemently engaging ourselves with pain and pleasure, forasmuch as these
 too much knit and ally the soul to the body; whereas I rather, quite
 contrary, by reason it too much separates and disunites them. As an enemy
 is made more fierce by our flight, so pain grows proud to see us truckle
 under her. She will surrender upon much better terms to them who make head
 against her: a man must oppose and stoutly set himself against her. In
 retiring and giving ground, we invite and pull upon ourselves the ruin
 that threatens us. As the body is more firm in an encounter, the more
 stiffly and obstinately it applies itself to it, so is it with the soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But let us come to examples, which are the proper game of folks of such
 feeble force as myself; where we shall find that it is with pain as with
 stones, that receive a brighter or a duller lustre according to the foil
 they are set in, and that it has no more room in us than we are pleased to
 allow it:

 We are more sensible of one little touch of a surgeon's lancet than of
 twenty wounds with a sword in the heat of fight. The pains of
 childbearing, said by the physicians and by God himself to be great, and
 which we pass through with so many ceremonies?there are whole
 nations that make nothing of them. I set aside the Lacedaemonian women,
 but what else do you find in the Swiss among our foot-soldiers, if not
 that, as they trot after their husbands, you see them to-day carry the
 child at their necks that they carried yesterday in their bellies? The
 counterfeit Egyptians we have amongst us go themselves to wash theirs, so
 soon as they come into the world, and bathe in the first river they meet.
 Besides so many wenches as daily drop their children by stealth, as they
 conceived them, that fair and noble wife of Sabinus, a patrician of Rome,
 for another's interest, endured alone, without help, without crying out,
 or so much as a groan, the bearing of twins.?[Plutarch, On Love, c.
 34.]?A poor simple boy of Lacedaemon having stolen a fox (for they
 more fear the shame of stupidity in stealing than we do the punishment of
 the knavery), and having got it under his coat, rather endured the tearing
 out of his bowels than he would discover his theft. And another offering
 incense at a sacrifice, suffered himself to be burned to the bone by a
 coal that fell into his sleeve, rather than disturb the ceremony. And
 there have been a great number, for a sole trial of virtue, following
 their institutions, who have at seven years old endured to be whipped to
 death without changing their countenance. And Cicero has seen them fight
 in parties, with fists, feet, and teeth, till they have fainted and sunk
 down, rather than confess themselves overcome:

 Every one knows the story of Scaevola, that having slipped into the
 enemy's camp to kill their general, and having missed his blow, to repair
 his fault, by a more strange invention and to deliver his country, he
 boldly confessed to Porsenna, who was the king he had a purpose to kill,
 not only his design, but moreover added that there were then in the camp a
 great number of Romans, his accomplices in the enterprise, as good men as
 he; and to show what a one he himself was, having caused a pan of burning
 coals to be brought, he saw and endured his arm to broil and roast, till
 the king himself, conceiving horror at the sight, commanded the pan to be
 taken away. What would you say of him that would not vouchsafe to respite
 his reading in a book whilst he was under incision? And of the other that
 persisted to mock and laugh in contempt of the pains inflicted upon him;
 so that the provoked cruelty of the executioners that had him in handling,
 and all the inventions of tortures redoubled upon him, one after another,
 spent in vain, gave him the bucklers? But he was a philosopher. But what!
 a gladiator of Caesar's endured, laughing all the while, his wounds to be
 searched, lanced, and laid open:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["What ordinary gladiator ever groaned? Which of them ever changed
 countenance? Which of them not only stood or fell indecorously?
 Which, when he had fallen and was commanded to receive the stroke of
 the sword, contracted his neck."?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 17.]

 Let us bring in the women too. Who has not heard at Paris of her that
 caused her face to be flayed only for the fresher complexion of a new
 skin? There are who have drawn good and sound teeth to make their voices
 more soft and sweet, or to place the other teeth in better order. How many
 examples of the contempt of pain have we in that sex? What can they not
 do, what do they fear to do, for never so little hope of an addition to
 their beauty?

 I have seen some of them swallow sand, ashes, and do their utmost to
 destroy their stomachs to get pale complexions. To make a fine Spanish

 have notches in their sides cut into the very quick, and sometimes to
 death?

 It is an ordinary thing with several nations at this day to wound
 themselves in good earnest to gain credit to what they profess; of which
 our king, relates notable examples of what he has seen in Poland and done
 towards himself.?[Henry III.]?But besides this, which I know
 to have been imitated by some in France, when I came from that famous
 assembly of the Estates at Blois, I had a little before seen a maid in
 Picardy, who to manifest the ardour of her promises, as also her
 constancy, give herself, with a bodkin she wore in her hair, four or five
 good lusty stabs in the arm, till the blood gushed out to some purpose.
 The Turks give themselves great scars in honour of their mistresses, and
 to the end they may the longer remain, they presently clap fire to the
 wound, where they hold it an incredible time to stop the blood and form
 the cicatrice; people that have been eyewitnesses of it have both written
 and sworn it to me. But for ten aspers?[A Turkish coin worth about a
 penny]?there are there every day fellows to be found that will give
 themselves a good deep slash in the arms or thighs. I am willing, however,
 to have the testimonies nearest to us when we have most need of them; for
 Christendom furnishes us with enough. After the example of our blessed
 Guide there have been many who have crucified themselves. We learn by
 testimony very worthy of belief, that King St. Louis wore a hair-shirt
 till in his old age his confessor gave him a dispensation to leave it off;
 and that every Friday he caused his shoulders to be drubbed by his priest
 with five small chains of iron which were always carried about amongst his
 night accoutrements for that purpose.

 William, our last Duke of Guienne, the father of that Eleanor who
 transmitted that duchy to the houses of France and England, continually
 for the last ten or twelve years of his life wore a suit of armour under a
 religious habit by way of penance. Foulke, Count of Anjou, went as far as
 Jerusalem, there to cause himself to be whipped by two of his servants,
 with a rope about his neck, before the sepulchre of our Lord. But do we
 not, moreover, every Good Friday, in various places, see great numbers of
 men and women beat and whip themselves till they lacerate and cut the
 flesh to the very bones? I have often seen it, and 'tis without any
 enchantment; and it was said there were some amongst them (for they go
 disguised) who for money undertook by this means to save harmless the
 religion of others, by a contempt of pain, so much the greater, as the
 incentives of devotion are more effectual than those of avarice. Q.
 Maximus buried his son when he was a consul, and M. Cato his when praetor
 elect, and L. Paulus both his, within a few days one after another, with
 such a countenance as expressed no manner of grief. I said once merrily of
 a certain person, that he had disappointed the divine justice; for the
 violent death of three grown-up children of his being one day sent him,
 for a severe scourge, as it is to be supposed, he was so far from being
 afflicted at the accident, that he rather took it for a particular grace
 and favour of heaven. I do not follow these monstrous humours, though I
 lost two or three at nurse, if not without grief, at least without
 repining, and yet there is hardly any accident that pierces nearer to the
 quick. I see a great many other occasions of sorrow, that should they
 happen to me I should hardly feel; and have despised some, when they have
 befallen me, to which the world has given so terrible a figure that I
 should blush to boast of my constancy:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ex quo intelligitur, non in natura, sed in opinione,

 Opinion is a powerful party, bold, and without measure. Who ever so
 greedily hunted after security and repose as Alexander and Caesar did
 after disturbance and difficulties? Teres, the father of Sitalces, was
 wont to say that "when he had no wars, he fancied there was no difference
 betwixt him and his groom." Cato the consul, to secure some cities of
 Spain from revolt, only interdicting the inhabitants from wearing arms, a
 great many killed themselves:

 How many do we know who have forsaken the calm and sweetness of a quiet
 life at home amongst their acquaintance, to seek out the horror of
 unhabitable deserts; and having precipitated themselves into so abject a
 condition as to become the scorn and contempt of the world, have hugged
 themselves with the conceit, even to affectation. Cardinal Borromeo, who
 died lately at Milan, amidst all the jollity that the air of Italy, his
 youth, birth, and great riches, invited him to, kept himself in so austere
 a way of living, that the same robe he wore in summer served him for
 winter too; he had only straw for his bed, and his hours of leisure from
 affairs he continually spent in study upon his knees, having a little
 bread and a glass of water set by his book, which was all the provision of
 his repast, and all the time he spent in eating.

 If the sight be not the most necessary of all our senses, 'tis at least
 the most pleasant; but the most pleasant and most useful of all our
 members seem to be those of generation; and yet a great many have
 conceived a mortal hatred against them only for this, that they were too
 pleasant, and have deprived themselves of them only for their value: as
 much thought he of his eyes that put them out. The generality and more
 solid sort of men look upon abundance of children as a great blessing; I,
 and some others, think it as great a benefit to be without them. And when
 you ask Thales why he does not marry, he tells you, because he has no mind
 to leave any posterity behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That our opinion gives the value to things is very manifest in the great
 number of those which we do, not so much prizing them, as ourselves, and
 never considering either their virtues or their use, but only how dear
 they cost us, as though that were a part of their substance; and we only
 repute for value in them, not what they bring to us, but what we add to
 them. By which I understand that we are great economisers of our expense:
 as it weighs, it serves for so much as it weighs. Our opinion will never
 suffer it to want of its value: the price gives value to the diamond;
 difficulty to virtue; suffering to devotion; and griping to physic. A
 certain person, to be poor, threw his crowns into the same sea to which so
 many come, in all parts of the world, to fish for riches. Epicurus says
 that to be rich is no relief, but only an alteration, of affairs. In
 truth, it is not want, but rather abundance, that creates avarice. I will
 deliver my own experience concerning this affair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have since my emergence from childhood lived in three sorts of
 conditions. The first, which continued for some twenty years, I passed
 over without any other means but what were casual and depending upon the
 allowance and assistance of others, without stint, but without certain
 revenue. I then spent my money so much the more cheerfully, and with so
 much the less care how it went, as it wholly depended upon my
 overconfidence of fortune. I never lived more at my ease; I never had the
 repulse of finding the purse of any of my friends shut against me, having
 enjoined myself this necessity above all other necessities whatever, by no
 means to fail of payment at the appointed time, which also they have a
 thousand times respited, seeing how careful I was to satisfy them; so that
 I practised at once a thrifty, and withal a kind of alluring, honesty. I
 naturally feel a kind of pleasure in paying, as if I eased my shoulders of
 a troublesome weight and freed myself from an image of slavery; as also
 that I find a ravishing kind of satisfaction in pleasing another and doing
 a just action. I except payments where the trouble of bargaining and
 reckoning is required; and in such cases; where I can meet with nobody to
 ease me of that charge, I delay them, how scandalously and injuriously
 soever, all I possibly can, for fear of the wranglings for which both my
 humour and way of speaking are so totally improper and unfit. There is
 nothing I hate so much as driving a bargain; 'tis a mere traffic of
 cozenage and impudence, where, after an hour's cheapening and hesitating,
 both parties abandon their word and oath for five sols' abatement. Yet I
 always borrowed at great disadvantage; for, wanting the confidence to
 speak to the person myself, I committed my request to the persuasion of a
 letter, which usually is no very successful advocate, and is of very great
 advantage to him who has a mind to deny. I, in those days, more jocundly
 and freely referred the conduct of my affairs to the stars, than I have
 since done to my own providence and judgment. Most good managers look upon
 it as a horrible thing to live always thus in uncertainty, and do not
 consider, in the first place, that the greatest part of the world live so:
 how many worthy men have wholly abandoned their own certainties, and yet
 daily do it, to the winds, to trust to the inconstant favour of princes
 and of fortune? Caesar ran above a million of gold, more than he was
 worth, in debt to become Caesar; and how many merchants have begun their
 traffic by the sale of their farms, which they sent into the Indies,

 In so great a siccity of devotion as we see in these days, we have a
 thousand and a thousand colleges that pass it over commodiously enough,
 expecting every day their dinner from the liberality of Heaven. Secondly,
 they do not take notice that this certitude upon which they so much rely
 is not much less uncertain and hazardous than hazard itself. I see misery
 as near beyond two thousand crowns a year as if it stood close by me; for
 besides that it is in the power of chance to make a hundred breaches to
 poverty through the greatest strength of our riches ?there being
 very often no mean betwixt the highest and the lowest fortune:

 <p>
 and to turn all our barricadoes and bulwarks topsy-turvy, I find that, by
 divers causes, indigence is as frequently seen to inhabit with those who
 have estates as with those that have none; and that, peradventure, it is
 then far less grievous when alone than when accompanied with riches. These
 flow more from good management than from revenue;

 The greatest and most wealthy princes are by poverty and want driven to

 My second condition of life was to have money of my own, wherein I so
 ordered the matter that I had soon laid up a very notable sum out of a
 mean fortune, considering with myself that that only was to be reputed
 having which a man reserves from his ordinary expense, and that a man
 cannot absolutely rely upon revenue he hopes to receive, how clear soever
 the hope may be. For what, said I, if I should be surprised by such or
 such an accident? And after such-like vain and vicious imaginations, would
 very learnedly, by this hoarding of money, provide against all
 inconveniences; and could, moreover, answer such as objected to me that
 the number of these was too infinite, that if I could not lay up for all,
 I could, however, do it at least for some and for many. Yet was not this
 done without a great deal of solicitude and anxiety of mind; I kept it
 very close, and though I dare talk so boldly of myself, never spoke of my
 money, but falsely, as others do, who being rich, pretend to be poor, and
 being poor, pretend to be rich, dispensing their consciences from ever
 telling sincerely what they have: a ridiculous and shameful prudence. Was
 I going a journey? Methought I was never enough provided: and the more I
 loaded myself with money, the more also was I loaded with fear, one while
 of the danger of the roads, another of the fidelity of him who had the
 charge of my baggage, of whom, as some others that I know, I was never
 sufficiently secure if I had him not always in my eye. If I chanced to
 leave my cash-box behind me, O, what strange suspicions and anxiety of
 mind did I enter into, and, which was worse, without daring to acquaint
 anybody with it. My mind was eternally taken up with such things as these,
 so that, all things considered, there is more trouble in keeping money
 than in getting it. And if I did not altogether so much as I say, or was
 not really so scandalously solicitous of my money as I have made myself
 out to be, yet it cost me something at least to restrain myself from being
 so. I reaped little or no advantage by what I had, and my expenses seemed
 nothing less to me for having the more to spend; for, as Bion said, the
 hairy men are as angry as the bald to be pulled; and after you are once
 accustomed to it and have once set your heart upon your heap, it is no
 more at your service; you cannot find in your heart to break it: 'tis a
 building that you will fancy must of necessity all tumble down to ruin if
 you stir but the least pebble; necessity must first take you by the throat
 before you can prevail upon yourself to touch it; and I would sooner have
 pawned anything I had, or sold a horse, and with much less constraint upon
 myself, than have made the least breach in that beloved purse I had so
 carefully laid by. But the danger was that a man cannot easily prescribe
 certain limits to this desire (they are hard to find in things that a man
 conceives to be good), and to stint this good husbandry so that it may not
 degenerate into avarice: men still are intent upon adding to the heap and
 increasing the stock from sum to sum, till at last they vilely deprive
 themselves of the enjoyment of their own proper goods, and throw all into
 reserve, without making any use of them at all. According to this rule,
 they are the richest people in the world who are set to guard the walls
 and gates of a wealthy city. All moneyed men I conclude to be covetous.
 Plato places corporal or human goods in this order: health, beauty,
 strength, riches; and riches, says he, are not blind, but very
 clear-sighted, when illuminated by prudence. Dionysius the son did a very
 handsome act upon this subject; he was informed that one of the Syracusans
 had hid a treasure in the earth, and thereupon sent to the man to bring it
 to him, which he accordingly did, privately reserving a small part of it
 only to himself, with which he went to another city, where being cured of
 his appetite of hoarding, he began to live at a more liberal rate; which
 Dionysius hearing, caused the rest of his treasure to be restored to him,
 saying, that since he had learned to use it, he very willingly returned it
 back to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I continued some years in this hoarding humour, when I know not what good
 demon fortunately put me out of it, as he did the Syracusan, and made me
 throw abroad all my reserve at random, the pleasure of a certain journey I
 took at very great expense having made me spurn this fond love of money
 underfoot; by which means I am now fallen into a third way of living (I
 speak what I think of it), doubtless much more pleasant and regular, which
 is, that I live at the height of my revenue; sometimes the one, sometimes
 the other may perhaps exceed, but 'tis very little and but rarely that
 they differ. I live from hand to mouth, and content myself in having
 sufficient for my present and ordinary expense; for as to extraordinary
 occasions, all the laying up in the world would never suffice. And 'tis
 the greatest folly imaginable to expect that fortune should ever
 sufficiently arm us against herself; 'tis with our own arms that we are to
 fight her; accidental ones will betray us in the pinch of the business. If
 I lay up, 'tis for some near and contemplated purpose; not to purchase
 lands, of which I have no need, but to purchase pleasure:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non esse cupidum, pecunia est; non esse emacem, vertigal est."

 ["Not to be covetous, is money; not to be acquisitive, is revenue."

 I neither am in any great apprehension of wanting, nor in desire of any
 more:

 ["The fruit of riches is in abundance; satiety declares abundance."
 ?Idem, ibid., vi. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And I am very well pleased that this reformation in me has fallen out in
 an age naturally inclined to avarice, and that I see myself cleared of a
 folly so common to old men, and the most ridiculous of all human follies.

 Feraulez, a man that had run through both fortunes, and found that the
 increase of substance was no increase of appetite either to eating or
 drinking, sleeping or the enjoyment of his wife, and who on the other side
 felt the care of his economics lie heavy upon his shoulders, as it does on
 mine, was resolved to please a poor young man, his faithful friend, who
 panted after riches, and made him a gift of all his, which were
 excessively great, and, moreover, of all he was in the daily way of
 getting by the liberality of Cyrus, his good master, and by the war;
 conditionally that he should take care handsomely to maintain and
 plentifully to entertain him as his guest and friend; which being
 accordingly done, they afterwards lived very happily together, both of
 them equally content with the change of their condition. 'Tis an example
 that I could imitate with all my heart; and I very much approve the
 fortune of the aged prelate whom I see to have so absolutely stripped
 himself of his purse, his revenue, and care of his expense, committing
 them one while to one trusty servant, and another while to another, that
 he has spun out a long succession of years, as ignorant, by this means, of
 his domestic affairs as a mere stranger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The confidence in another man's virtue is no light evidence of a man's
 own, and God willingly favours such a confidence. As to what concerns him
 of whom I am speaking, I see nowhere a better governed house, more nobly
 and constantly maintained than his. Happy to have regulated his affairs to
 so just a proportion that his estate is sufficient to do it without his
 care or trouble, and without any hindrance, either in the spending or
 laying it up, to his other more quiet employments, and more suitable both
 to his place and liking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plenty, then, and indigence depend upon the opinion every one has of them;
 and riches no more than glory or health have other beauty or pleasure than
 he lends them by whom they are possessed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every one is well or ill at ease, according as he so finds himself; not he
 whom the world believes, but he who believes himself to be so, is content;
 and in this alone belief gives itself being and reality. Fortune does us
 neither good nor hurt; she only presents us the matter and the seed, which
 our soul, more powerful than she, turns and applies as she best pleases;
 the sole cause and sovereign mistress of her own happy or unhappy
 condition. All external accessions receive taste and colour from the
 internal constitution, as clothes warm us, not with their heat, but our
 own, which they are fit to cover and nourish; he who would shield
 therewith a cold body, would do the same service for the cold, for so snow
 and ice are preserved. And, certes, after the same manner that study is a
 torment to an idle man, abstinence from wine to a drunkard, frugality to
 the spendthrift, and exercise to a lazy, tender-bred fellow, so it is of
 all the rest. The things are not so painful and difficult of themselves,
 but our weakness or cowardice makes them so. To judge of great, and high
 matters requires a suitable soul; otherwise we attribute the vice to them
 which is really our own. A straight oar seems crooked in the water it does
 not only import that we see the thing, but how and after what manner we
 see it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After all this, why, amongst so many discourses that by so many arguments
 persuade men to despise death and to endure pain, can we not find out one
 that helps us? And of so many sorts of imaginations as have so prevailed
 upon others as to persuade them to do so, why does not every one apply
 some one to himself, the most suitable to his own humour? If he cannot
 digest a strong-working decoction to eradicate the evil, let him at least
 take a lenitive to ease it:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["It is an effeminate and flimsy opinion, nor more so in pain than
 in pleasure, in which, while we are at our ease, we cannot bear
 without a cry the sting of a bee. The whole business is to commend
 thyself."?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 22.]
</pre>
 <p>
 As to the rest, a man does not transgress philosophy by permitting the
 acrimony of pains and human frailty to prevail so much above measure; for
 they constrain her to go back to her unanswerable replies: "If it be ill
 to live in necessity, at least there is no necessity upon a man to live in
 necessity": "No man continues ill long but by his own fault." He who has
 neither the courage to die nor the heart to live, who will neither resist
 nor fly, what can we do with him?

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLI??NOT TO COMMUNICATE A MAN'S HONOUR
 </h2>
 <p>
 Of all the follies of the world, that which is most universally received
 is the solicitude of reputation and glory; which we are fond of to that
 degree as to abandon riches, peace, life, and health, which are effectual
 and substantial goods, to pursue this vain phantom and empty word, that
 has neither body nor hold to be taken of it:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> La fama, ch'invaghisce a un dolce suono
 Gli superbi mortali, et par si bella,
 E un eco, un sogno, anzi d'un sogno un'ombra,
 Ch'ad ogni vento si dilegua a sgombra."

 ["Fame, which with alluring sound charms proud mortals, and appears
 so fair, is but an echo, a dream, nay, the shadow of a dream, which
 at every breath vanishes and dissolves."
 ?Tasso, Gerus., xiv. 63.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And of all the irrational humours of men, it should seem that the
 philosophers themselves are among the last and the most reluctant to
 disengage themselves from this: 'tis the most restive and obstinate of
 all:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quia etiam bene proficientes animos tentare non cessat."

 ["Because it ceases not to assail even well-directed minds"
 ?St. Augustin, De Civit. Dei, v. 14.]
</pre>
 <p>
 There is not any one of which reason so clearly accuses the vanity; but it
 is so deeply rooted in us that I dare not determine whether any one ever
 clearly discharged himself from it or no. After you have said all and
 believed all has been said to its prejudice, it produces so intestine an
 inclination in opposition to your best arguments that you have little
 power to resist it; for, as Cicero says, even those who most controvert
 it, would yet that the books they write about it should visit the light
 under their own names, and seek to derive glory from seeming to despise
 it. All other things are communicable and fall into commerce: we lend our
 goods and stake our lives for the necessity and service of our friends;
 but to communicate a man's honour, and to robe another with a man's own
 glory, is very rarely seen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet we have some examples of that kind. Catulus Luctatius in the
 Cimbrian war, having done all that in him lay to make his flying soldiers
 face about upon the enemy, ran himself at last away with the rest, and
 counterfeited the coward, to the end his men might rather seem to follow
 their captain than to fly from the enemy; which was to abandon his own
 reputation in order to cover the shame of others. When Charles V. came
 into Provence in the year 1537, 'tis said that Antonio de Leva, seeing the
 emperor positively resolved upon this expedition, and believing it would
 redound very much to his honour, did, nevertheless, very stiffly oppose it
 in the council, to the end that the entire glory of that resolution should
 be attributed to his master, and that it might be said his own wisdom and
 foresight had been such as that, contrary to the opinion of all, he had
 brought about so great an enterprise; which was to do him honour at his
 own expense. The Thracian ambassadors coming to comfort Archileonida, the
 mother of Brasidas, upon the death of her son, and commending him to that
 height as to say he had not left his like behind him, she rejected this
 private and particular commendation to attribute it to the public: "Tell
 me not that," said she; "I know the city of Sparta has many citizens both
 greater and of greater worth than he." In the battle of Crecy, the Prince
 of Wales, being then very young, had the vanguard committed to him: the
 main stress of the battle happened to be in that place, which made the
 lords who were with him, finding themselves overmatched, send to King
 Edward to advance to their relief. He inquired of the condition his son
 was in, and being answered that he was alive and on horseback: "I should,
 then, do him wrong," said the king, "now to go and deprive him of the
 honour of winning this battle he has so long and so bravely sustained;
 what hazard soever he runs, that shall be entirely his own"; and,
 accordingly, would neither go nor send, knowing that if he went, it would
 be said all had been lost without his succour, and that the honour of the
 victory would be wholly attributed to him.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Semper enim quod postremum adjectum est,
 id rem totam videtur traxisse."

 ["For always that which is last added, seems to have accomplished
 the whole affair."?Livy, xxvii. 45.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Many at Rome thought, and would usually say, that the greatest of Scipio's
 acts were in part due to Laelius, whose constant practice it was still to
 advance and support Scipio's grandeur and renown, without any care of his
 own. And Theopompus, king of Sparta, to him who told him the republic
 could not miscarry since he knew so well how to command, "Tis rather,"
 answered he, "because the people know so well how to obey." As women
 succeeding to peerages had, notwithstanding their sex, the privilege to
 attend and give their votes in the trials that appertained to the
 jurisdiction of peers; so the ecclesiastical peers, notwithstanding their
 profession, were obliged to attend our kings in their wars, not only with
 their friends and servants, but in their own persons. As the Bishop of
 Beauvais did, who being with Philip Augustus at the battle of Bouvines,
 had a notable share in that action; but he did not think it fit for him to
 participate in the fruit and glory of that violent and bloody trade. He
 with his own hand reduced several of the enemy that day to his mercy, whom
 he delivered to the first gentleman he met either to kill or receive them
 to quarter, referring the whole execution to this other hand; and he did
 this with regard to William, Earl of Salisbury, whom he gave up to Messire
 Jehan de Nesle. With a like subtlety of conscience to that I have just
 named, he would kill but not wound, and for that reason ever fought with a
 mace. And a certain person of my time, being reproached by the king that
 he had laid hands on a priest, stiffly and positively denied he had done
 any such thing: the meaning of which was, he had cudgelled and kicked him.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLII??OF THE INEQUALITY AMOUNGST US.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Plutarch says somewhere that he does not find so great a difference
 betwixt beast and beast as he does betwixt man and man; which he says in
 reference to the internal qualities and perfections of the soul. And, in
 truth, I find so vast a distance betwixt Epaminondas, according to my
 judgment of him, and some that I know, who are yet men of good sense, that
 I could willingly enhance upon Plutarch, and say that there is more
 difference betwixt such and such a man than there is betwixt such a man
 and such a beast:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Ah! how much may one man surpass another!"
 ?Terence, Eunuchus, ii. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and that there are as many and innumerable degrees of mind as there are
 cubits betwixt this and heaven. But as touching the estimate of men, 'tis
 strange that, ourselves excepted, no other creature is esteemed beyond its
 proper qualities; we commend a horse for his strength and sureness of
 foot,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Volucrem
 Sic laudamus equum, facili cui plurima palma
 Fervet, et exsultat rauco victoria circo,"

 ["So we praise the swift horse, for whose easy mastery many a hand
 glows in applause, and victory exults in the hoarse circus.
 ?"Juvenal, viii. 57.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and not for his rich caparison; a greyhound for his speed of heels, not
 for his fine collar; a hawk for her wing, not for her gesses and bells.
 Why, in like manner, do we not value a man for what is properly his own?
 He has a great train, a beautiful palace, so much credit, so many thousand
 pounds a year: all these are about him, but not in him. You will not buy a
 pig in a poke: if you cheapen a horse, you will see him stripped of his
 housing-cloths, you will see him naked and open to your eye; or if he be
 clothed, as they anciently were wont to present them to princes to sell,
 'tis only on the less important parts, that you may not so much consider
 the beauty of his colour or the breadth of his crupper, as principally to
 examine his legs, eyes, and feet, which are the members of greatest use:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Regibus hic mos est: ubi equos mercantur, opertos
 Inspiciunt; ne, si facies, ut saepe, decora
 Molli fulta pede est, emptorem inducat hiantem"

 ["This is the custom of kings: when they buy horses, they have open
 inspection, lest, if a fair head, as often chances, is supported by
 a weak foot, it should tempt the gaping purchaser."
 ?Horace, Sat., i. 2, 86.]
</pre>
 <p>
 why, in giving your estimate of a man, do you prize him wrapped and
 muffled up in clothes? He then discovers nothing to you but such parts as
 are not in the least his own, and conceals those by which alone one may
 rightly judge of his value. 'Tis the price of the blade that you inquire
 into, not of the scabbard: you would not peradventure bid a farthing for
 him, if you saw him stripped. You are to judge him by himself and not by
 what he wears; and, as one of the ancients very pleasantly said: "Do you
 know why you repute him tall? You reckon withal the height of his
 pattens."?[Seneca, Ep. 76.]?The pedestal is no part of the
 statue. Measure him without his stilts; let him lay aside his revenues and
 his titles; let him present himself in his shirt. Then examine if his body
 be sound and sprightly, active and disposed to perform its functions. What
 soul has he? Is she beautiful, capable, and happily provided of all her
 faculties? Is she rich of what is her own, or of what she has borrowed?
 Has fortune no hand in the affair? Can she, without winking, stand the
 lightning of swords? is she indifferent whether her life expire by the
 mouth or through the throat? Is she settled, even and content? This is
 what is to be examined, and by that you are to judge of the vast
 differences betwixt man and man. Is he:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sapiens, sibique imperiosus,
 Quern neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent;
 Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores
 Fortis; et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus,
 Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari;
 In quem manca ruit semper fortuna?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["The wise man, self-governed, whom neither poverty, nor death,
 nor chains affright: who has the strength to resist his appetites
 and to contemn honours: who is wholly self-contained: whom no
 external objects affect: whom fortune assails in vain."
 ?Horace, Sat., ii. 7,]
</pre>
 <p>
 such a man is five hundred cubits above kingdoms and duchies; he is an
 absolute monarch in and to himself:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sapiens, . . . Pol! ipse fingit fortunam sibi;"

 ["The wise man is the master of his own fortune,"
 ?Plautus, Trin., ii. 2, 84.]
</pre>
 <p>
 what remains for him to covet or desire?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nonne videmus,
 Nil aliud sibi naturam latrare, nisi ut, quoi
 Corpore sejunctus dolor absit, mente fruatur,
 Jucundo sensu, cura semotu' metuque?"

 ["Do we not see that human nature asks no more for itself than
 that, free from bodily pain, it may exercise its mind agreeably,
 exempt from care and fear."?Lucretius, ii. 16.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Compare with such a one the common rabble of mankind, stupid and
 mean-spirited, servile, instable, and continually floating with the
 tempest of various passions, that tosses and tumbles them to and fro, and
 all depending upon others, and you will find a greater distance than
 betwixt heaven and earth; and yet the blindness of common usage is such
 that we make little or no account of it; whereas if we consider a peasant
 and a king, a nobleman and a vassal, a magistrate and a private man, a
 rich man and a poor, there appears a vast disparity, though they differ no
 more, as a man may say, than in their breeches.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In Thrace the king was distinguished from his people after a very pleasant
 and especial manner; he had a religion by himself, a god all his own, and
 which his subjects were not to presume to adore, which was Mercury,
 whilst, on the other hand, he disdained to have anything to do with
 theirs, Mars, Bacchus, and Diana. And yet they are no other than pictures
 that make no essential dissimilitude; for as you see actors in a play
 representing the person of a duke or an emperor upon the stage, and
 immediately after return to their true and original condition of valets
 and porters, so the emperor, whose pomp and lustre so dazzle you in
 public:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Scilicet grandes viridi cum luce smaragdi
 Auto includuntur, teriturque thalassina vestis
 Assidue, et Veneris sudorem exercita potat;"

 ["Because he wears great emeralds richly set in gold, darting green
 lustre; and the sea-blue silken robe, worn with pressure, and moist
 with illicit love (and absorbs the sweat of Venus)."
 ?Lucretius, iv. 1123.]
</pre>
 <p>
 do but peep behind the curtain, and you will see no thing more than an
 ordinary man, and peradventure more contemptible than the meanest of his
 subjects:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ille beatus introrsum est, istius bracteata felicitas est;"

 ["The one is happy in himself; the happiness of the other is
 counterfeit."?Seneca, Ep., 115.]
</pre>
 <p>
 cowardice, irresolution, ambition, spite, and envy agitate him as much as
 another:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non enim gazae, neque consularis
 Submovet lictor miseros tumultus
 Mentis, et curas laqueata circum
 Tecta volantes."

 ["For not treasures, nor the consular lictor, can remove the
 miserable tumults of the mind, nor cares that fly about panelled
 ceilings."?Horace, Od., ii. 16, 9.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Care and fear attack him even in the centre of his battalions:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Re veraque metus hominum curaeque sequaces
 Nec metuunt sonitus armorum, nee fera tela;
 Audacterque inter reges, rerumque potentes
 Versantur, neque fulgorem reverentur ab auro."

 ["And in truth the fears and haunting cares of men fear not the
 clash of arms nor points of darts, and mingle boldly with great
 kings and men in authority, nor respect the glitter of gold."
 ?Lucretius, ii. 47.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Do fevers, gout, and apoplexies spare him any more than one of us? When
 old age hangs heavy upon his shoulders, can the yeomen of his guard ease
 him of the burden? When he is astounded with the apprehension of death,
 can the gentlemen of his bedchamber comfort and assure him? When jealousy
 or any other caprice swims in his brain, can our compliments and
 ceremonies restore him to his good-humour? The canopy embroidered with
 pearl and gold he lies under has no virtue against a violent fit of the
 colic:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nee calidae citius decedunt corpore febres
 Textilibus si in picturis, ostroque rubenti
 Jactaris, quam si plebeia in veste cubandum est."

 ["Nor do burning fevers quit you sooner if you are stretched on a
 couch of rich tapestry and in a vest of purple dye, than if you be
 in a coarse blanket."?Idem, ii. 34.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The flatterers of Alexander the Great possessed him that he was the son of
 Jupiter; but being one day wounded, and observing the blood stream from
 his wound: "What say you now, my masters," said he, "is not this blood of
 a crimson colour and purely human? This is not of the complexion of that
 which Homer makes to issue from the wounded gods." The poet Hermodorus had
 written a poem in honour of Antigonus, wherein he called him the son of
 the sun: "He who has the emptying of my close-stool," said Antigonus,
 "knows to the contrary." He is but a man at best, and if he be deformed or
 ill-qualified from his birth, the empire of the universe cannot set him to
 rights:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Puellae
 Hunc rapiant; quidquid calcaverit hic, rosa fiat,"

 ["Let girls carry him off; wherever he steps let there spring up a
 rose!"?Persius, Sat., ii. 38.]
</pre>
 <p>
 what of all that, if he be a fool? even pleasure and good fortune are not
 relished without vigour and understanding:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Haec perinde sunt, ut ilius animus; qui ea possidet
 Qui uti scit, ei bona; illi, qui non uritur recte, mala."

 ["Things are, as is the mind of their possessor; who knows how to
 use them, to him they are good; to him who abuses them, ill."
 ?Terence, Heart., i. 3, 21.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Whatever the benefits of fortune are, they yet require a palate to relish
 them. 'Tis fruition, and not possession, that renders us happy:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["'Tis not lands, or a heap of brass and gold, that has removed
 fevers from the ailing body of the owner, or cares from his mind.
 The possessor must be healthy, if he thinks to make good use of his
 realised wealth. To him who is covetous or timorous his house and
 estate are as a picture to a blind man, or a fomentation to a
 gouty."?Horace, Ep., i. 2, 47.]
</pre>
 <p>
 He is a sot, his taste is palled and flat; he no more enjoys what he has
 than one that has a cold relishes the flavour of canary, or than a horse
 is sensible of his rich caparison. Plato is in the right when he tells us
 that health, beauty, vigour, and riches, and all the other things called
 goods, are equally evil to the unjust as good to the just, and the evil on
 the contrary the same. And therefore where the body and the mind are in
 disorder, to what use serve these external conveniences: considering that
 the least prick with a pin, or the least passion of the soul, is
 sufficient to deprive one of the pleasure of being sole monarch of the
 world. At the first twitch of the gout it signifies much to be called Sir
 and Your Majesty!
 </p><br>

 ["Wholly made up of silver and gold."?Tibullus, i. 2, 70.]
</pre>
 <p>
 does he not forget his palaces and girandeurs? If he be angry, can his
 being a prince keep him from looking red and looking pale, and grinding
 his teeth like a madman? Now, if he be a man of parts and of right nature,
 royalty adds very little to his happiness;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si ventri bene, si lateri est, pedibusque tuffs, nil
 Divitix poterunt regales addere majus;"

 ["If it is well with thy belly, thy side and thy feet, regal wealth
 will be able to add nothing."?Horace, Ep., i. 12, 5.]
</pre>
 <p>
 he discerns 'tis nothing but counterfeit and gullery. Nay, perhaps he
 would be of King Seleucus' opinion, that he who knew the weight of a
 sceptre would not stoop to pick it up, if he saw it lying before him, so
 great and painful are the duties incumbent upon a good king.?[Plutarch,
 If a Sage should Meddle with Affairs of Stale, c. 12.]?Assuredly it
 can be no easy task to rule others, when we find it so hard a matter to
 govern ourselves; and as to dominion, that seems so charming, the frailty
 of human judgment and the difficulty of choice in things that are new and
 doubtful considered, I am very much of opinion that it is far more easy
 and pleasant to follow than to lead; and that it is a great settlement and
 satisfaction of mind to have only one path to walk in, and to have none to
 answer for but a man's self;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ut satius multo jam sit parere quietum,
 Quam regere imperio res velle."

 ["'Tis much better quietly to obey than wish to rule."
 ?Lucretius, V, 1126.]
</pre>
 <p>
 To which we may add that saying of Cyrus, that no man was fit to rule but
 he who in his own worth was of greater value than those he was to govern;
 but King Hiero in Xenophon says further, that in the fruition even of
 pleasure itself they are in a worse condition than private men; forasmuch
 as the opportunities and facility they have of commanding those things at
 will takes off from the delight that ordinary folks enjoy:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Pinguis amor, nimiumque patens, in taedia nobis
 Vertitur, et, stomacho dulcis ut esca, nocet."

 ["Love in excess and too palpable turns to weariness, and, like
 sweetmeats to the stomach, is injurious."?Ovid, Amoy., ii. 19, 25.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Can we think that the singing boys of the choir take any great delight in
 music? the satiety rather renders it troublesome and tedious to them.
 Feasts, balls, masquerades and tiltings delight such as but rarely see,
 and desire to see, them; but having been frequently at such
 entertainments, the relish of them grows flat and insipid. Nor do women so
 much delight those who make a common practice of the sport. He who will
 not give himself leisure to be thirsty can never find the true pleasure of
 drinking. Farces and tumbling tricks are pleasant to the spectators, but a
 wearisome toil to those by whom they are performed. And that this is so,
 we see that princes divert themselves sometimes in disguising their
 quality, awhile to depose themselves, and to stoop to the poor and
 ordinary way of living of the meanest of their people.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Plerumque gratae divitibus vices
 Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum
 Coenae, sine aulaeis et ostro,
 Soliicitam explicuere frontem."

 ["The rich are often pleased with variety; and the plain supper in a
 poor cottage, without tapestry and purple, has relaxed the anxious
 brow."?Horace, Od., iii. 29, 13.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Nothing is so distasteful and clogging as abundance. What appetite would
 not be baffled to see three hundred women at its mercy, as the grand
 signor has in his seraglio? And, of his ancestors what fruition or taste
 of sport did he reserve to himself, who never went hawking without seven
 thousand falconers? And besides all this, I fancy that this lustre of
 grandeur brings with it no little disturbance and uneasiness upon the
 enjoyment of the most tempting pleasures; the great are too conspicuous
 and lie too open to every one's view. Neither do I know to what end a man
 should more require of them to conceal their errors, since what is only
 reputed indiscretion in us, the people in them brand with the names of
 tyranny and contempt of the laws, and, besides their proclivity to vice,
 are apt to hold that it is a heightening of pleasure to them, to insult
 over and to trample upon public observances. Plato, indeed, in his
 Goygias, defines a tyrant to be one who in a city has licence to do
 whatever his own will leads him to do; and by reason of this impunity, the
 display and publication of their vices do ofttimes more mischief than the
 vice itself. Every one fears to be pried into and overlooked; but princes
 are so, even to their very gestures, looks and thoughts, the people
 conceiving they have right and title to be judges of them besides that the
 blemishes of the great naturally appear greater by reason of the eminence
 and lustre of the place where they are seated, and that a mole or a wart
 appears greater in them than a wide gash in others. And this is the reason
 why the poets feign the amours of Jupiter to be performed in the disguises
 of so many borrowed shapes, and that amongst the many amorous practices
 they lay to his charge, there is only one, as I remember, where he appears
 in his own majesty and grandeur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But let us return to Hiero, who further complains of the inconveniences he
 found in his royalty, in that he could not look abroad and travel the
 world at liberty, being as it were a prisoner in the bounds and limits of
 his own dominion, and that in all his actions he was evermore surrounded
 with an importunate crowd. And in truth, to see our kings sit all alone at
 table, environed with so many people prating about them, and so many
 strangers staring upon them, as they always are, I have often been moved
 rather to pity than to envy their condition. King Alfonso was wont to say,
 that in this asses were in a better condition than kings, their masters
 permitting them to feed at their own ease and pleasure, a favour that
 kings cannot obtain of their servants. And it has never come into my fancy
 that it could be of any great benefit to the life of a man of sense to
 have twenty people prating about him when he is at stool; or that the
 services of a man of ten thousand livres a year, or that has taken Casale
 or defended Siena, should be either more commodious or more acceptable to
 him, than those of a good groom of the chamber who understands his place.
 The advantages of sovereignty are in a manner but imaginary: every degree
 of fortune has in it some image of principality. Caesar calls all the
 lords of France, having free franchise within their own demesnes,
 roitelets or petty kings; and in truth, the name of sire excepted, they go
 pretty far towards kingship; for do but look into the provinces remote
 from court, as Brittany for example; take notice of the train, the
 vassals, the officers, the employments, service, ceremony, and state of a
 lord who lives retired from court in his own house, amongst his own
 tenants and servants; and observe withal the flight of his imagination;
 there is nothing more royal; he hears talk of his master once a year, as
 of a king of Persia, without taking any further recognition of him, than
 by some remote kindred his secretary keeps in some register. And, to speak
 the truth, our laws are easy enough, so easy that a gentleman of France
 scarce feels the weight of sovereignty pinch his shoulders above twice in
 his life. Real and effectual subjection only concerns such amongst us as
 voluntarily thrust their necks under the yoke, and who design to get
 wealth and honours by such services: for a man that loves his own
 fireside, and can govern his house without falling by the ears with his
 neighbours or engaging in suits of law, is as free as a Duke of Venice.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Paucos servitus, plures servitutem tenent."

 ["Servitude enchains few, but many enchain themselves to
 servitude."?Seneca, Ep., 22.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But that which Hiero is most concerned at is, that he finds himself
 stripped of all friendship, deprived of all mutual society, wherein the
 true and most perfect fruition of human life consists. For what testimony
 of affection and goodwill can I extract from him that owes me, whether he
 will or no, all that he is able to do? Can I form any assurance of his
 real respect to me, from his humble way of speaking and submissive
 behaviour, when these are ceremonies it is not in his choice to deny? The
 honour we receive from those that fear us is not honour; those respects
 are due to royalty and not to me:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Maximum hoc regni bonum est
 Quod facta domini cogitur populus sui
 Quam ferre, tam laudare."

 ["'Tis the greatest benefit of a kingdom that the people is forced
 to commend, as well as to bear the acts of the ruler."
 ?Seneca, Thyestes, ii. i, 30.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Do I not see that the wicked and the good king, he that is hated and he
 that is beloved, have the one as much reverence paid him as the other? My
 predecessor was, and my successor shall be, served with the same ceremony
 and state. If my subjects do me no harm, 'tis no evidence of any good
 affection; why should I look upon it as such, seeing it is not in their
 power to do it if they would? No one follows me or obeys my commands upon
 the account of any friendship, betwixt him and me; there can be no
 contracting of friendship where there is so little relation and
 correspondence: my own height has put me out of the familiarity of and
 intelligence with men; there is too great disparity and disproportion
 betwixt us. They follow me either upon the account of decency and custom;
 or rather my fortune, than me, to increase their own. All they say to me
 or do for me is but outward paint, appearance, their liberty being on all
 parts restrained by the great power and authority I have over them. I see
 nothing about me but what is dissembled and disguised.

 The Emperor Julian being one day applauded by his courtiers for his exact
 justice: "I should be proud of these praises," said he, "did they come
 from persons that durst condemn or disapprove the contrary, in case I
 should do it." All the real advantages of princes are common to them with
 men of meaner condition ('tis for the gods to mount winged horses and feed
 upon ambrosia): they have no other sleep, nor other appetite than we; the
 steel they arm themselves withal is of no better temper than that we also
 use; their crowns neither defend them from the rain nor the sun.

 <p>
 Diocletian, who wore a crown so fortunate and revered, resigned it to
 retire to the felicity of a private life; and some time after the
 necessity of public affairs requiring that he should reassume his charge,
 he made answer to those who came to court him to it: "You would not
 offer," said he, "to persuade me to this, had you seen the fine order of
 the trees I have planted in my orchard, and the fair melons I have sown in
 my garden."

 In Anacharsis' opinion, the happiest state of government would be where,
 all other things being equal, precedence should be measured out by the

 When King Pyrrhus prepared for his expedition into Italy, his wise
 counsellor Cyneas, to make him sensible of the vanity of his ambition:
 "Well, sir," said he, "to what end do you make all this mighty
 preparation?"?"To make myself master of Italy," replied the king.
 "And what after that is done?" said Cyneas. "I will pass over into Gaul
 and Spain," said the other. "And what then?"?"I will then go to
 subdue Africa; and lastly, when I have brought the whole world to my
 subjection, I will sit down and rest content at my own ease."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For God sake, sir," replied Cyneas, "tell me what hinders that you may
 not, if you please, be now in the condition you speak of? Why do you not
 now at this instant settle yourself in the state you seem to aim at, and
 spare all the labour and hazard you interpose?"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLIII??OF SUMPTUARY LAWS
 </h2>
 <p>
 The way by which our laws attempt to regulate idle and vain expenses in
 meat and clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end designed. The true
 way would be to beget in men a contempt of silks and gold, as vain,
 frivolous, and useless; whereas we augment to them the honours, and
 enhance the value of such things, which, sure, is a very improper way to
 create a disgust. For to enact that none but princes shall eat turbot,
 shall wear velvet or gold lace, and interdict these things to the people,
 what is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one
 more agog to eat and wear them? Let kings leave off these ensigns of
 grandeur; they have others enough besides; those excesses are more
 excusable in any other than a prince. We may learn by the example of
 several nations better ways of exterior distinction of quality (which,
 truly, I conceive to be very requisite in a state) enough, without
 fostering to this purpose such corruption and manifest inconvenience. 'Tis
 strange how suddenly and with how much ease custom in these indifferent
 things establishes itself and becomes authority. We had scarce worn cloth
 a year, in compliance with the court, for the mourning of Henry II., but
 that silks were already grown into such contempt with every one, that a
 man so clad was presently concluded a citizen: silks were divided betwixt
 the physicians and surgeons, and though all other people almost went in
 the same habit, there was, notwithstanding, in one thing or other,
 sufficient distinction of the several conditions of men. How suddenly do
 greasy chamois and linen doublets become the fashion in our armies, whilst
 all neatness and richness of habit fall into contempt? Let kings but lead
 the dance and begin to leave off this expense, and in a month the business
 will be done throughout the kingdom, without edict or ordinance; we shall
 all follow. It should be rather proclaimed, on the contrary, that no one
 should wear scarlet or goldsmiths' work but courtesans and tumblers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Zeleucus by the like invention reclaimed the corrupted manners of the
 Locrians. His laws were, that no free woman should be allowed any more
 than one maid to follow her, unless she was drunk: nor was to stir out of
 the city by night, wear jewels of gold about her, or go in an embroidered
 robe, unless she was a professed and public prostitute; that, bravos
 excepted, no man was to wear a gold ring, nor be seen in one of those
 effeminate robes woven in the city of Miletus. By which infamous
 exceptions he discreetly diverted his citizens from superfluities and
 pernicious pleasures, and it was a project of great utility to attract
 then by honour and ambition to their duty and obedience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Our kings can do what they please in such external reformations; their own
 inclination stands in this case for a law:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quicquid principes faciunt, praecipere videntur."

 ["What princes themselves do, they seem to prescribe."
 ?Quintil., Declam., 3.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Whatever is done at court passes for a rule through the rest of France.
 Let the courtiers fall out with these abominable breeches, that discover
 so much of those parts should be concealed; these great bellied doublets,
 that make us look like I know not what, and are so unfit to admit of arms;
 these long effeminate locks of hair; this foolish custom of kissing what
 we present to our equals, and our hands in saluting them, a ceremony in
 former times only due to princes. Let them not permit that a gentleman
 shall appear in place of respect without his sword, unbuttoned and
 untrussed, as though he came from the house of office; and that, contrary
 to the custom of our forefathers and the particular privilege of the
 nobles of this kingdom, we stand a long time bare to them in what place
 soever, and the same to a hundred others, so many tiercelets and
 quartelets of kings we have got nowadays and other like vicious
 innovations: they will see them all presently vanish and cried down. These
 are, 'tis true, but superficial errors; but they are of ill augury, and
 enough to inform us that the whole fabric is crazy and tottering, when we
 see the roughcast of our walls to cleave and split.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plato in his Laws esteems nothing of more pestiferous consequence to his
 city than to give young men the liberty of introducing any change in their
 habits, gestures, dances, songs, and exercises, from one form to another;
 shifting from this to that, hunting after novelties, and applauding the
 inventors; by which means manners are corrupted and the old institutions
 come to be nauseated and despised. In all things, saving only in those
 that are evil, a change is to be feared; even the change of seasons,
 winds, viands, and humours. And no laws are in their true credit, but such
 to which God has given so long a continuance that no one knows their
 beginning, or that there ever was any other.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLIV??OF SLEEP
 </h2>
 <p>
 Reason directs that we should always go the same way, but not always at
 the same pace. And, consequently, though a wise man ought not so much to
 give the reins to human passions as to let him deviate from the right
 path, he may, notwithstanding, without prejudice to his duty, leave it to
 them to hasten or to slacken his speed, and not fix himself like a
 motionless and insensible Colossus. Could virtue itself put on flesh and
 blood, I believe the pulse would beat faster going on to assault than in
 going to dinner: that is to say, there is a necessity she should heat and
 be moved upon this account. I have taken notice, as of an extraordinary
 thing, of some great men, who in the highest enterprises and most
 important affairs have kept themselves in so settled and serene a calm, as
 not at all to break their sleep. Alexander the Great, on the day assigned
 for that furious battle betwixt him and Darius, slept so profoundly and so
 long in the morning, that Parmenio was forced to enter his chamber, and
 coming to his bedside, to call him several times by his name, the time to
 go to fight compelling him so to do. The Emperor Otho, having put on a
 resolution to kill himself that night, after having settled his domestic
 affairs, divided his money amongst his servants, and set a good edge upon
 a sword he had made choice of for the purpose, and now staying only to be
 satisfied whether all his friends had retired in safety, he fell into so
 sound a sleep that the gentlemen of his chamber heard him snore. The death
 of this emperor has in it circumstances paralleling that of the great
 Cato, and particularly this just related for Cato being ready to despatch
 himself, whilst he only stayed his hand in expectation of the return of a
 messenger he had sent to bring him news whether the senators he had sent
 away were put out from the Port of Utica, he fell into so sound a sleep,
 that they heard him snore in the next room; and the man, whom he had sent
 to the port, having awakened him to let him know that the tempestuous
 weather had hindered the senators from putting to sea, he despatched away
 another messenger, and composing again himself in the bed, settled to
 sleep, and slept till by the return of the last messenger he had certain
 intelligence they were gone. We may here further compare him with
 Alexander in the great and dangerous storm that threatened him by the
 sedition of the tribune Metellus, who, attempting to publish a decree for
 the calling in of Pompey with his army into the city at the time of
 Catiline's conspiracy, was only and that stoutly opposed by Cato, so that
 very sharp language and bitter menaces passed betwixt them in the senate
 about that affair; but it was the next day, in the forenoon, that the
 controversy was to be decided, where Metellus, besides the favour of the
 people and of Caesar?at that time of Pompey's faction?was to
 appear accompanied with a rabble of slaves and gladiators; and Cato only
 fortified with his own courage and constancy; so that his relations,
 domestics, and many virtuous people of his friends were in great
 apprehensions for him; and to that degree, that some there were who passed
 over the whole night without sleep, eating, or drinking, for the danger
 they saw him running into; his wife and sisters did nothing but weep and
 torment themselves in his house; whereas, he, on the contrary, comforted
 every one, and after having supped after his usual manner, went to bed,
 and slept profoundly till morning, when one of his fellow-tribunes roused
 him to go to the encounter. The knowledge we have of the greatness of this
 man's courage by the rest of his life, may warrant us certainly to judge
 that his indifference proceeded from a soul so much elevated above such
 accidents, that he disdained to let it take any more hold of his fancy
 than any ordinary incident.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the naval engagement that Augustus won of Sextus Pompeius in Sicily,
 just as they were to begin the fight, he was so fast asleep that his
 friends were compelled to wake him to give the signal of battle: and this
 was it that gave Mark Antony afterwards occasion to reproach him that he
 had not the courage so much as with open eyes to behold the order of his
 own squadrons, and not to have dared to present himself before the
 soldiers, till first Agrippa had brought him news of the victory obtained.
 But as to the young Marius, who did much worse (for the day of his last
 battle against Sylla, after he had marshalled his army and given the word
 and signal of battle, he laid him down under the shade of a tree to repose
 himself, and fell so fast asleep that the rout and flight of his men could
 hardly waken him, he having seen nothing of the fight), he is said to have
 been at that time so extremely spent and worn out with labour and want of
 sleep, that nature could hold out no longer. Now, upon what has been said,
 the physicians may determine whether sleep be so necessary that our lives
 depend upon it: for we read that King Perseus of Macedon, being prisoner
 at Rome, was killed by being kept from sleep; but Pliny instances such as
 have lived long without sleep. Herodotus speaks of nations where the men
 sleep and wake by half-years, and they who write the life of the sage
 Epimenides affirm that he slept seven-and-fifty years together.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLV??OF THE BATTLE OF DREUX
 </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [December 19, 1562, in which the Catholics, under the command of the
 Duc de Guise and the Constable de Montmorenci, defeated the
 Protestants, commanded by the Prince de Conde. See Sismondi, Hist.
 des Francais, vol. xviii., p. 354.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Our battle of Dreux is remarkable for several extraordinary incidents; but
 such as have no great kindness for M. de Guise, nor much favour his
 reputation, are willing to have him thought to blame, and that his making
 a halt and delaying time with the forces he commanded, whilst the
 Constable, who was general of the army, was racked through and through
 with the enemy's artillery, his battalion routed, and himself taken
 prisoner, is not to be excused; and that he had much better have run the
 hazard of charging the enemy in flank, than staying for the advantage of
 falling in upon the rear, to suffer so great and so important a loss. But,
 besides what the event demonstrated, he who will consider it without
 passion or prejudice will easily be induced to confess that the aim and
 design, not of a captain only, but of every private soldier, ought to
 regard the victory in general, and that no particular occurrences, how
 nearly soever they may concern his own interest, should divert him from
 that pursuit. Philopoemen, in an encounter with Machanidas, having sent
 before a good strong party of his archers and slingers to begin the
 skirmish, and these being routed and hotly pursued by the enemy, who,
 pushing on the fortune of their arms, and in that pursuit passing by the
 battalion where Philopoemen was, though his soldiers were impatient to
 fall on, he did not think fit to stir from his post nor to present himself
 to the enemy to relieve his men, but having suffered these to be chased
 and cut in pieces before his face, charged in upon the enemy's foot when
 he saw them left unprotected by the horse, and notwithstanding that they
 were Lacedaemonians, yet taking them in the nick, when thinking themselves
 secure of the victory, they began to disorder their ranks; he did this
 business with great facility, and then put himself in pursuit of
 Machanidas. Which case is very like that of Monsieur de Guise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In that bloody battle betwixt Agesilaus and the Boeotians, which Xenophon,
 who was present at it, reports to be the sharpest that he had ever seen,
 Agesilaus waived the advantage that fortune presented him, to let the
 Boeotian battalions pass by and then to charge them in the rear, how
 certain soever he might make himself of the victory, judging it would
 rather be an effect of conduct than valour, to proceed that way; and
 therefore, to show his prowess, rather chose with a marvellous ardour of
 courage to charge them in the front; but he was well beaten and well
 wounded for his pains, and constrained at last to disengage himself, and
 to take the course he had at first neglected; opening his battalion to
 give way to this torrent of Boeotians, and they being passed by, taking
 notice that they marched in disorder, like men who thought themselves out
 of danger, he pursued and charged them in flank; yet could not so prevail
 as to bring it to so general a rout but that they leisurely retreated,
 still facing about upon him till they had retired to safety.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLVI??OF NAMES
 </h2>
 <p>
 What variety of herbs soever are shufed together in the dish, yet the
 whole mass is swallowed up under one name of a sallet. In like manner,
 under the consideration of names, I will make a hodge-podge of divers
 articles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every nation has certain names, that, I know not why, are taken in no good
 sense, as with us, John, William, Benedict. In the genealogy of princes,
 also, there seem to be certain names fatally affected, as the Ptolemies of
 Egypt, the Henries in England, the Charleses in France, the Baldwins in
 Flanders, and the Williams of our ancient Aquitaine, from whence, 'tis
 said, the name of Guyenne has its derivation; which would seem far fetched
 were there not as crude derivations in Plato himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Item, 'tis a frivolous thing in itself, but nevertheless worthy to be
 recorded for the strangeness of it, that is written by an eyewitness, that
 Henry, Duke of Normandy, son of Henry II., king of England, making a great
 feast in France, the concourse of nobility and gentry was so great, that
 being, for sport's sake, divided into troops, according to their names, in
 the first troop, which consisted of Williams, there were found an hundred
 and ten knights sitting at the table of that name, without reckoning the
 ordinary gentlemen and servants.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is as pleasant to distinguish the tables by the names of the guests as
 it was in the Emperor Geta to distinguish the several courses of his meat
 by the first letters of the meats themselves; so that those that began
 with B were served up together, as brawn, beef, bream, bustards,
 becca-ficos; and so of the others. Item, there is a saying that it is a
 good thing to have a good name, that is to say, credit and a good repute;
 but besides this, it is really convenient to have a well-sounding name,
 such as is easy of pronunciation and easy to be remembered, by reason that
 kings and other great persons do by that means the more easily know and
 the more hardly forget us; and indeed of our own servants we more
 frequently call and employ those whose names are most ready upon the
 tongue. I myself have seen Henry II., when he could not for his heart hit
 of a gentleman's name of our country of Gascony, and moreover was fain to
 call one of the queen's maids of honour by the general name of her race,
 her own family name being so difficult to pronounce or remember; and
 Socrates thinks it worthy a father's care to give fine names to his
 children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Item,'tis said that the foundation of Notre Dame la Grande at Poitiers
 took its original from hence that a debauched young fellow formerly living
 in that place, having got to him a wench, and, at her first coming in,
 asking her name, and being answered that it was Mary, he felt himself so
 suddenly pierced through with the awe of religion and the reverence to
 that sacred name of the Blessed Virgin, that he not only immediately sent
 the girl away, but became a reformed man and so continued the remainder of
 his life; and that, in consideration of this miracle, there was erected
 upon the place where this young man's house stood, first a chapel
 dedicated to our Lady and afterwards the church that we now see standing
 there. This vocal and auricular reproof wrought upon the conscience, and
 that right into the soul; this that follows, insinuated itself merely by
 the senses. Pythagoras being in company with some wild young fellows, and
 perceiving that, heated with the feast, they comploted to go violate an
 honest house, commanded the singing wench to alter her wanton airs; and by
 a solemn, grave, and spondaic music, gently enchanted and laid asleep
 their ardour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Item, will not posterity say that our modern reformation has been
 wonderfully delicate and exact, in having not only combated errors and
 vices, and filled the world with devotion, humility, obedience, peace, and
 all sorts of virtue; but in having proceeded so far as to quarrel with our
 ancient baptismal names of Charles, Louis, Francis, to fill the world with
 Methuselahs, Ezekiels, and Malachis, names of a more spiritual sound? A
 gentleman, a neighbour of mine, a great admirer of antiquity, and who was
 always extolling the excellences of former times in comparison with this
 present age of ours, did not, amongst the rest, forget to dwell upon the
 lofty and magnificent sound of the gentleman's names of those days, Don
 Grumedan, Quedregan, Agesilan, which, but to hear named he conceived to
 denote other kind of men than Pierre, Guillot, and Michel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Item, I am mightily pleased with Jacques Amyot for leaving, throughout a
 whole French oration, the Latin names entire, without varying and garbling
 them to give them a French cadence. It seemed a little harsh and rough at
 first; but already custom, by the authority of his Plutarch, has overcome
 that novelty. I have often wished that such as write histories in Latin
 would leave our names as they find them and as they are; for in making
 Vaudemont into Vallemontanus, and metamorphosing names to make them suit
 better with the Greek or Latin, we know not where we are, and with the
 persons of the men lose the benefit of the story.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To conclude, 'tis a scurvy custom and of very ill consequence that we have
 in our kingdom of France to call every one by the name of his manor or
 seigneury; 'tis the thing in the world that the most prejudices and
 confounds families and descents. A younger brother of a good family,
 having a manor left him by his father, by the name of which he has been
 known and honoured, cannot handsomely leave it; ten years after his
 decease it falls into the hand of a stranger, who does the same: do but
 judge whereabouts we shall be concerning the knowledge of these men. We
 need look no further for examples than our own royal family, where every
 partition creates a new surname, whilst, in the meantime, the original of
 the family is totally lost. There is so great liberty taken in these
 mutations, that I have not in my time seen any one advanced by fortune to
 any extraordinary condition who has not presently had genealogical titles
 added to him, new and unknown to his father, and who has not been
 inoculated into some illustrious stem by good luck; and the obscurest
 families are the most apt for falsification. How many gentlemen have we in
 France who by their own account are of royal extraction? more, I think,
 than who will confess they are not. Was it not a pleasant passage of a
 friend of mine? There were, several gentlemen assembled together about the
 dispute of one seigneur with another; which other had, in truth, some
 preeminence of titles and alliances above the ordinary gentry. Upon the
 debate of this prerogative, every one, to make himself equal to him,
 alleged, this one extraction, that another; this, the near resemblance of
 name, that, of arms; another, an old worm-eaten patent; the very least of
 them was great-grandchild to some foreign king. When they came to sit
 down, to dinner, my friend, instead of taking his place amongst them,
 retiring with most profound conges, entreated the company to excuse him
 for having hitherto lived with them at the saucy rate of a companion; but
 being now better informed of their quality, he would begin to pay them the
 respect due to their birth and grandeur, and that it would ill become him
 to sit down among so many princes?ending this farce with a thousand
 reproaches: "Let us, in God's name, satisfy ourselves with what our
 fathers were contented with, with what we are. We are great enough, if we
 rightly understand how to maintain it. Let us not disown the fortune and
 condition of our ancestors, and let us lay aside these ridiculous
 pretences, that can never be wanting to any one that has the impudence to
 allege them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arms have no more security than surnames. I bear azure powdered with
 trefoils or, with a lion's paw of the same armed gules in fesse. What
 privilege has this to continue particularly in my house? A son-in-law will
 transport it into another family, or some paltry purchaser will make them
 his first arms. There is nothing wherein there is more change and
 confusion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But this consideration leads me, perforce, into another subject. Let us
 pry a little narrowly into, and, in God's name, examine upon what
 foundation we erect this glory and reputation for which the world is
 turned topsy-turvy: wherein do we place this renown that we hunt after
 with so much pains? It is, in the end, Peter or William that carries it,
 takes it into his possession, and whom it only concerns. O what a valiant
 faculty is hope, that in a mortal subject, and in a moment, makes nothing
 of usurping infinity, immensity, eternity, and of supplying its master's
 indigence, at its pleasure, with all things he can imagine or desire!
 Nature has given us this passion for a pretty toy to play withal. And this
 Peter or William, what is it but a sound, when all is done? or three or
 four dashes with a pen, so easy to be varied that I would fain know to
 whom is to be attributed the glory of so many victories, to Guesquin, to
 Glesquin, or to Gueaquin? and yet there would be something of greater
 moment in the case than in Lucian, that Sigma should serve Tau with a
 process; for
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non levia aut ludicra petuntur
 Praemia;"

 ["They aim at no slight or jocular rewards."?AEneid, xii. 764.]
</pre>
 <p>
 the chase is there in very good earnest: the question is, which of these
 letters is to be rewarded for so many sieges, battles, wounds,
 imprisonments, and services done to the crown of France by this famous
 constable? Nicholas Denisot?[Painter and poet, born at Le Mans,1515.]?
 never concerned himself further than the letters of his name, of which he
 has altered the whole contexture to build up by anagram the Count
 d'Alsinois, whom he has handsomely endowed with the glory of his poetry
 and painting. The historian Suetonius was satisfied with only the meaning
 of his name, which made him cashier his father's surname, Lenis, to leave
 Tranquillus successor to the reputation of his writings. Who would believe
 that Captain Bayard should have no honour but what he derives from the
 deeds of Peter Terrail; and that Antonio Iscalin should suffer himself to
 his face to be robbed of the honour of so many navigations and commands at
 sea and land by Captain Paulin and the Baron de la Garde? Secondly, these
 are dashes of the pen common to a thousand people. How many are there, in
 every family, of the same name and surname? and how many more in several
 families, ages, and countries? History tells us of three of the name of
 Socrates, of five Platos, of eight Aristotles, of seven Xenophons, of
 twenty Demetrii, and of twenty Theodores; and how many more she was not
 acquainted with we may imagine. Who hinders my groom from calling himself
 Pompey the Great? But after all, what virtue, what authority, or what
 secret springs are there that fix upon my deceased groom, or the other
 Pompey, who had his head cut off in Egypt, this glorious renown, and these
 so much honoured flourishes of the pen, so as to be of any advantage to
 them?

 Survivors indeed tickle themselves with these fine phrases, and by them
 incited to jealousy and desire, inconsiderately and according to their own
 fancy, attribute to the dead this their own feeling, vainly flattering
 themselves that they shall one day in turn be capable of the same

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLVII??OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR JUDGMENT
 </h2>
 <h3>
 Well says this verse:
 </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["There is everywhere much liberty of speech."?Iliad, xx. 249.]
</pre>
 <p>
 For example:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Hannibal conquered, but knew not how to make the best use of his
 victorious venture."?Petrarch, Son., 83.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Such as would improve this argument, and condemn the oversight of our
 leaders in not pushing home the victory at Moncontour, or accuse the King
 of Spain of not knowing how to make the best use of the advantage he had
 against us at St. Quentin, may conclude these oversights to proceed from a
 soul already drunk with success, or from a spirit which, being full and
 overgorged with this beginning of good fortune, had lost the appetite of
 adding to it, already having enough to do to digest what it had taken in:
 he has his arms full, and can embrace no more: unworthy of the benefit
 fortune has conferred upon him and the advantage she had put into his
 hands: for what utility does he reap from it, if, notwithstanding, he give
 his enemy respite to rally and make head against him? What hope is there
 that he will dare at another time to attack an enemy reunited and
 recomposed, and armed anew with anger and revenge, who did not dare to
 pursue them when routed and unmanned by fear?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Dum fortuna calet, dum conficit omnia terror."

 ["Whilst fortune is fresh, and terror finishes all."
 ?Lucan, vii. 734.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But withal, what better opportunity can he expect than that he has lost?
 'Tis not here, as in fencing, where the most hits gain the prize; for so
 long as the enemy is on foot, the game is new to begin, and that is not to
 be called a victory that puts not an end to the war. In the encounter
 where Caesar had the worst, near the city of Oricum, he reproached
 Pompey's soldiers that he had been lost had their general known how to
 overcome; and afterwards clawed him in a very different fashion when it
 came to his turn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But why may not a man also argue, on the contrary, that it is the effect
 of a precipitous and insatiate spirit not to know how to bound and
 restrain its coveting; that it is to abuse the favours of God to exceed
 the measure He has prescribed them: and that again to throw a man's self
 into danger after a victory obtained is again to expose himself to the
 mercy of fortune: that it is one of the greatest discretions in the rule
 of war not to drive an enemy to despair? Sylla and Marius in the social
 war, having defeated the Marsians, seeing yet a body of reserve that,
 prompted by despair, was coming on like enraged brutes to dash in upon
 them, thought it not convenient to stand their charge. Had not Monsieur de
 Foix's ardour transported him so furiously to pursue the remains of the
 victory of Ravenna, he had not obscured it by his own death. And yet the
 recent memory of his example served to preserve Monsieur d'Anguien from
 the same misfortune at the battle of Serisoles. 'Tis dangerous to attack a
 man you have deprived of all means to escape but by his arms, for
 necessity teaches violent resolutions:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Gravissimi sunt morsus irritatae necessitatis."

 ["Irritated necessity bites deepest."?Portius Latro., Declam.]

 "Vincitur haud gratis, jugulo qui provocat hostem."

 ["He is not readily beaten who provokes the enemy by shewing
 his throat."?or: "He who presents himself to his foe, sells his
 life dear."?Lucan, iv. 275.]
</pre>
 <p>
 This was it that made Pharax withhold the King of Lacedaemon, who had won
 a battle against the Mantineans, from going to charge a thousand Argians,
 who had escaped in an entire body from the defeat, but rather let them
 steal off at liberty that he might not encounter valour whetted and
 enraged by mischance. Clodomir, king of Aquitaine, after his victory
 pursuing Gondemar, king of Burgundy, beaten and making off as fast as he
 could for safety, compelled him to face about and make head, wherein his
 obstinacy deprived him of the fruit of his conquest, for he there lost his
 life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In like manner, if a man were to choose whether he would have his soldiers
 richly and sumptuously accoutred or armed only for the necessity of the
 matter in hand, this argument would step in to favour the first, of which
 opinion was Sertorius, Philopcemen, Brutus, Caesar, and others, that it is
 to a soldier an enflaming of courage and a spur himself in brave attire;
 and withal a motive to be more obstinate in fight, having his arms, which
 are in a manner his estate and whole inheritance to defend; which is the
 reason, says Xenophon, why those of Asia carried their wives and
 concubines, with their choicest jewels and greatest wealth, along with
 them to the wars. But then these arguments would be as ready to stand up
 for the other side; that a general ought rather to lessen in his men their
 solicitude of preserving themselves than to increase it; that by such
 means they will be in a double fear of hazarding their persons, as it will
 be a double temptation to the enemy to fight with greater resolution where
 so great booty and so rich spoils are to be obtained; and this very thing
 has been observed in former times, notably to encourage the Romans against
 the Samnites. Antiochus, shewing Hannibal the army he had raised,
 wonderfully splendid and rich in all sorts of equipage, asked him if the
 Romans would be satisfied with that army? "Satisfied," replied the other,
 "yes, doubtless, were their avarice never so great." Lycurgus not only
 forbad his soldiers all manner of bravery in their equipage, but,
 moreover, to strip their conquered enemies, because he would, as he said,
 that poverty and frugality should shine with the rest of the battle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At sieges and elsewhere, where occasion draws us near to the enemy, we
 willingly suffer our men to brave, rate, and affront him with all sorts of
 injurious language; and not without some colour of reason: for it is of no
 little consequence to take from them all hopes of mercy and composition,
 by representing to them that there is no fair quarter to be expected from
 an enemy they have incensed to that degree, nor other remedy remaining but
 in victory. And yet Vitellius found himself deceived in this way of
 proceeding; for having to do with Otho, weaker in the valour of his
 soldiers, long unaccustomed to war and effeminated with the delights of
 the city, he so nettled them at last with injurious language, reproaching
 them with cowardice and regret for the mistresses and entertainments they
 had left behind at Rome, that by this means he inspired them with such
 resolution as no exhortation had had the power to have done, and himself
 made them fall upon him, with whom their own captains before could by no
 means prevail. And, indeed, when they are injuries that touch to the
 quick, it may very well fall out that he who went but unwillingly to work
 in the behalf of his prince will fall to't with another sort of mettle
 when the quarrel is his own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Considering of how great importance is the preservation of the general of
 an army, and that the universal aim of an enemy is levelled directly at
 the head, upon which all the others depend, the course seems to admit of
 no dispute, which we know has been taken by so many great captains, of
 changing their habit and disguising their persons upon the point of going
 to engage. Nevertheless, the inconvenience a man by so doing runs into is
 not less than that he thinks to avoid; for the captain, by this means
 being concealed from the knowledge of his own men, the courage they should
 derive from his presence and example happens by degrees to cool and to
 decay; and not seeing the wonted marks and ensigns of their leader, they
 presently conclude him either dead, or that, despairing of the business,
 he is gone to shift for himself. And experience shows us that both these
 ways have been successful and otherwise. What befell Pyrrhus in the battle
 he fought against the Consul Levinus in Italy will serve us to both
 purposes; for though by shrouding his person under the armour of Megacles
 and making him wear his own, he undoubtedly preserved his own life, yet,
 by that very means, he was withal very near running into the other
 mischief of losing the battle. Alexander, Caesar, and Lucullus loved to
 make themselves known in a battle by rich accoutrements and armour of a
 particular lustre and colour: Agis, Agesilaus, and that great Gilippus, on
 the contrary, used to fight obscurely armed, and without any imperial
 attendance or distinction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Amongst other oversights Pompey is charged withal at the battle of
 Pharsalia, he is condemned for making his army stand still to receive the
 enemy's charge; by "reason that" (I shall here steal Plutarch's own words,
 which are better than mine) "he by so doing deprived himself of the
 violent impression the motion of running adds to the first shock of arms,
 and hindered that clashing of the combatants against one another which is
 wont to give them greater impetuosity and fury; especially when they come
 to rush in with their utmost vigour, their courages increasing by the
 shouts and the career; 'tis to render the soldiers' ardour, as a man may
 say, more reserved and cold." This is what he says. But if Caesar had come
 by the worse, why might it not as well have been urged by another, that,
 on the contrary, the strongest and most steady posture of fighting is that
 wherein a man stands planted firm without motion; and that they who are
 steady upon the march, closing up, and reserving their force within
 themselves for the push of the business, have a great advantage against
 those who are disordered, and who have already spent half their breath in
 running on precipitately to the charge? Besides that an army is a body
 made up of so many individual members, it is impossible for it to move in
 this fury with so exact a motion as not to break the order of battle, and
 that the best of them are not engaged before their fellows can come on to
 help them. In that unnatural battle betwixt the two Persian brothers, the
 Lacedaemonian Clearchus, who commanded the Greeks of Cyrus' party, led
 them on softly and without precipitation to the charge; but, coming within
 fifty paces, hurried them on full speed, hoping in so short a career both
 to keep their order and to husband their breath, and at the same time to
 give the advantage of impetuosity and impression both to their persons and
 their missile arms. Others have regulated this question as to their armies
 thus if your enemy come full drive upon you, stand firm to receive him; if
 he stand to receive you, run full drive upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the expedition of the Emperor Charles V. into Provence, King Francis
 was put to choose either to go meet him in Italy or to await him in his
 own dominions; wherein, though he very well considered of how great
 advantage it was to preserve his own territory entire and clear from the
 troubles of war, to the end that, being unexhausted of its stores, it
 might continually supply men and money at need; that the necessity of war
 requires at every turn to spoil and lay waste the country before us, which
 cannot very well be done upon one's own; to which may be added, that the
 country people do not so easily digest such a havoc by those of their own
 party as from an enemy, so that seditions and commotions might by such
 means be kindled amongst us; that the licence of pillage and plunder
 (which are not to be tolerated at home) is a great ease and refreshment
 against the fatigues and sufferings of war; and that he who has no other
 prospect of gain than his bare pay will hardly be kept from running home,
 being but two steps from his wife and his own house; that he who lays the
 cloth is ever at the charge of the feast; that there is more alacrity in
 assaulting than defending; and that the shock of a battle's loss in our
 own bowels is so violent as to endanger the disjointing of the whole body,
 there being no passion so contagious as that of fear, that is so easily
 believed, or that so suddenly diffuses itself; and that the cities that
 should hear the rattle of this tempest at their gates, that should take in
 their captains and soldiers yet trembling and out of breath, would be in
 danger in this heat and hurry to precipitate themselves upon some untoward
 resolution: notwithstanding all this, so it was that he chose to recall
 the forces he had beyond the mountains and to suffer the enemy to come to
 him. For he might, on the other hand, imagine that, being at home and
 amongst his friends, he could not fail of plenty of all manner of
 conveniences; the rivers and passes he had at his devotion would bring him
 in both provisions and money in all security, and without the trouble of
 convoy; that he should find his subjects by so much the more affectionate
 to him, by how much their danger was more near and pressing; that having
 so many cities and barriers to secure him, it would be in his power to
 give the law of battle at his own opportunity and advantage; and that, if
 it pleased him to delay the time, under cover and at his ease he might see
 his enemy founder and defeat himself with the difficulties he was certain
 to encounter, being engaged in a hostile country, where before, behind,
 and on every side war would be made upon him; no means to refresh himself
 or to enlarge his quarters, should diseases infest them, or to lodge his
 wounded men in safety; no money, no victuals, but at the point of the
 lance; no leisure to repose and take breath; no knowledge of the ways or
 country to secure him from ambushes and surprises; and in case of losing a
 battle, no possible means of saving the remains. Neither is there want of
 example in both these cases.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Scipio thought it much better to go and attack his enemy's territories in
 Africa than to stay at home to defend his own and to fight him in Italy,
 and it succeeded well with him. But, on the contrary, Hannibal in the same
 war ruined himself by abandoning the conquest of a foreign country to go
 and defend his own. The Athenians having left the enemy in their own
 dominions to go over into Sicily, were not favoured by fortune in their
 design; but Agathocles, king of Syracuse, found her favourable to him when
 he went over into Africa and left the war at home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By which examples we are wont to conclude, and with some reason, that
 events, especially in war, for the most part depend upon fortune, who will
 not be governed by nor submit unto human reasons and prudence, according
 to the poet:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et male consultis pretium est: prudentia fallit
 Nec fortune probat causas, sequiturque merentes,
 Sed vaga per cunctos nullo discrimine fertur.
 Scilicet est aliud, quod nos cogatque regatque
 Majus, et in proprias ducat mortalia leges."

 ["And there is value in ill counsel: prudence deceives: nor does
 fortune inquire into causes, nor aid the most deserving, but turns
 hither and thither without discrimination. Indeed there is a
 greater power which directs and rules us, and brings mortal affairs
 under its own laws."?Manilius, iv. 95.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But, to take the thing right, it should seem that our counsels and
 deliberations depend as much upon fortune as anything else we do, and that
 she engages also our arguments in her uncertainty and confusion. "We argue
 rashly and adventurously," says Timaeus in Plato, "by reason that, as well
 as ourselves, our discourses have great participation in the temerity of
 chance."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLVIII??OF WAR HORSES, OR DESTRIERS
 </h2>
 <p>
 I here have become a grammarian, I who never learned any language but by
 rote, and who do not yet know adjective, conjunction, or ablative. I think
 I have read that the Romans had a sort of horses by them called 'funales'
 or 'dextrarios', which were either led horses, or horses laid on at
 several stages to be taken fresh upon occasion, and thence it is that we
 call our horses of service 'destriers'; and our romances commonly use the
 phrase of 'adestrer' for 'accompagner', to accompany. They also called
 those that were trained in such sort, that running full speed, side by
 side, without bridle or saddle, the Roman gentlemen, armed at all pieces,
 would shift and throw themselves from one to the other, 'desultorios
 equos'. The Numidian men-at-arms had always a led horse in one hand,
 besides that they rode upon, to change in the heat of battle:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quibus, desultorum in modum, binos trahentibus equos, inter
 acerrimam saepe pugnam, in recentem equum, ex fesso, armatis
 transultare mos erat: tanta velocitas ipsis, tamque docile
 equorum genus."

 ["To whom it was a custom, leading along two horses, often in the
 hottest fight, to leap armed from a tired horse to a fresh one; so
 active were the men, and the horses so docile."?Livy, xxiii. 29.]
</pre>
 <p>
 There are many horses trained to help their riders so as to run upon any
 one, that appears with a drawn sword, to fall both with mouth and heels
 upon any that front or oppose them: but it often happens that they do more
 harm to their friends than to their enemies; and, moreover, you cannot
 loose them from their hold, to reduce them again into order, when they are
 once engaged and grappled, by which means you remain at the mercy of their
 quarrel. It happened very ill to Artybius, general of the Persian army,
 fighting, man to man, with Onesilus, king of Salamis, to be mounted upon a
 horse trained after this manner, it being the occasion of his death, the
 squire of Onesilus cleaving the horse down with a scythe betwixt the
 shoulders as it was reared up upon his master. And what the Italians
 report, that in the battle of Fornova, the horse of Charles VIII., with
 kicks and plunges, disengaged his master from the enemy that pressed upon
 him, without which he had been slain, sounds like a very great chance, if
 it be true.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [In the narrative which Philip de Commines has given of this battle,
 in which he himself was present (lib. viii. ch. 6), he tells us
 of wonderful performances by the horse on which the king was
 mounted. The name of the horse was Savoy, and it was the most
 beautiful horse he had ever seen. During the battle the king was
 personally attacked, when he had nobody near him but a valet de
 chambre, a little fellow, and not well armed. "The king," says
 Commines, "had the best horse under him in the world, and therefore
 he stood his ground bravely, till a number of his men, not a great
 way from him, arrived at the critical minute."]
</pre>
 <p>
 The Mamalukes make their boast that they have the most ready horses of any
 cavalry in the world; that by nature and custom they were taught to know
 and distinguish the enemy, and to fall foul upon them with mouth and
 heels, according to a word or sign given; as also to gather up with their
 teeth darts and lances scattered upon the field, and present them to their
 riders, on the word of command. 'T is said, both of Caesar and Pompey,
 that amongst their other excellent qualities they were both very good
 horsemen, and particularly of Caesar, that in his youth, being mounted on
 the bare back, without saddle or bridle, he could make the horse run,
 stop, and turn, and perform all its airs, with his hands behind him. As
 nature designed to make of this person, and of Alexander, two miracles of
 military art, so one would say she had done her utmost to arm them after
 an extraordinary manner for every one knows that Alexander's horse,
 Bucephalus, had a head inclining to the shape of a bull; that he would
 suffer himself to be mounted and governed by none but his master, and that
 he was so honoured after his death as to have a city erected to his name.
 Caesar had also one which had forefeet like those of a man, his hoofs
 being divided in the form of fingers, which likewise was not to be ridden,
 by any but Caesar himself, who, after his death, dedicated his statue to
 the goddess Venus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I do not willingly alight when I am once on horseback, for it is the place
 where, whether well or sick, I find myself most at ease. Plato recommends
 it for health, as also Pliny says it is good for the stomach and the
 joints. Let us go further into this matter since here we are.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We read in Xenophon a law forbidding any one who was master of a horse to
 travel on foot. Trogus Pompeius and Justin say that the Parthians were
 wont to perform all offices and ceremonies, not only in war but also all
 affairs whether public or private, make bargains, confer, entertain, take
 the air, and all on horseback; and that the greatest distinction betwixt
 freemen and slaves amongst them was that the one rode on horseback and the
 other went on foot, an institution of which King Cyrus was the founder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There are several examples in the Roman history (and Suetonius more
 particularly observes it of Caesar) of captains who, on pressing
 occasions, commanded their cavalry to alight, both by that means to take
 from them all hopes of flight, as also for the advantage they hoped in
 this sort of fight.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quo baud dubie superat Romanus,"

 ["Wherein the Roman does questionless excel."?Livy, ix. 22.]
</pre>
 <p>
 says Livy. And so the first thing they did to prevent the mutinies and
 insurrections of nations of late conquest was to take from them their arms
 and horses, and therefore it is that we so often meet in Caesar:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Arma proferri, jumenta produci, obsides dari jubet."

 ["He commanded the arms to be produced, the horses brought out,
 hostages to be given."?De Bello Gall., vii. II.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The Grand Signior to this day suffers not a Christian or a Jew to keep a
 horse of his own throughout his empire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Our ancestors, and especially at the time they had war with the English,
 in all their greatest engagements and pitched battles fought for the most
 part on foot, that they might have nothing but their own force, courage,
 and constancy to trust to in a quarrel of so great concern as life and
 honour. You stake (whatever Chrysanthes in Xenophon says to the contrary)
 your valour and your fortune upon that of your horse; his wounds or death
 bring your person into the same danger; his fear or fury shall make you
 reputed rash or cowardly; if he have an ill mouth or will not answer to
 the spur, your honour must answer for it. And, therefore, I do not think
 it strange that those battles were more firm and furious than those that
 are fought on horseback:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Caedebant pariter, pariterque ruebant
 Victores victique; neque his fuga nota, neque illis."

 ["They fought and fell pell-mell, victors and vanquished; nor was
 flight thought of by either."?AEneid, x. 756.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Their battles were much better disputed. Nowadays there are nothing but
 routs:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Primus clamor atque impetus rem decernit."

 ["The first shout and charge decides the business."?Livy, xxv. 41.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And the means we choose to make use of in so great a hazard should be as
 much as possible at our own command: wherefore I should advise to choose
 weapons of the shortest sort, and such of which we are able to give the
 best account. A man may repose more confidence in a sword he holds in his
 hand than in a bullet he discharges out of a pistol, wherein there must be
 a concurrence of several circumstances to make it perform its office, the
 powder, the stone, and the wheel: if any of which fail it endangers your
 fortune. A man himself strikes much surer than the air can direct his
 blow:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Et, quo ferre velint, permittere vulnera ventis
 Ensis habet vires; et gens quaecumque virorum est,
 Bella gerit gladiis."

 ["And so where they choose to carry [the arrows], the winds allow
 the wounds; the sword has strength of arm: and whatever nation of
 men there is, they wage war with swords."?Lucan, viii. 384.]
</pre>
 <p>
 But of that weapon I shall speak more fully when I come to compare the
 arms of the ancients with those of modern use; only, by the way, the
 astonishment of the ear abated, which every one grows familiar with in a
 short time, I look upon it as a weapon of very little execution, and hope
 we shall one day lay it aside. That missile weapon which the Italians
 formerly made use of both with fire and by sling was much more terrible:
 they called a certain kind of javelin, armed at the point with an iron
 three feet long, that it might pierce through and through an armed man,
 Phalarica, which they sometimes in the field darted by hand, sometimes
 from several sorts of engines for the defence of beleaguered places; the
 shaft being rolled round with flax, wax, rosin, oil, and other combustible
 matter, took fire in its flight, and lighting upon the body of a man or
 his target, took away all the use of arms and limbs. And yet, coming to
 close fight, I should think they would also damage the assailant, and that
 the camp being as it were planted with these flaming truncheons, would
 produce a common inconvenience to the whole crowd:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Magnum stridens contorta Phalarica venit,
 Fulminis acta modo."

 ["The Phalarica, launched like lightning, flies through
 the air with a loud rushing sound."?AEneid, ix. 705.]
</pre>
 <p>
 They had, moreover, other devices which custom made them perfect in (which
 seem incredible to us who have not seen them), by which they supplied the
 effects of our powder and shot. They darted their spears with so great
 force, as ofttimes to transfix two targets and two armed men at once, and
 pin them together. Neither was the effect of their slings less certain of
 execution or of shorter carriage:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Culling round stones from the beach for their slings; and with
 these practising over the waves, so as from a great distance to
 throw within a very small circuit, they became able not only to
 wound an enemy in the head, but hit any other part at pleasure."
 ?Livy, xxxviii. 29.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Their pieces of battery had not only the execution but the thunder of our
 cannon also:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ad ictus moenium cum terribili sonitu editos,
 pavor et trepidatio cepit."

 ["At the battery of the walls, performed with a terrible noise,
 the defenders began to fear and tremble."?Idem, ibid., 5.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The Gauls, our kinsmen in Asia, abominated these treacherous missile arms,
 it being their use to fight, with greater bravery, hand to hand:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["They are not so much concerned about large gashes-the bigger and
 deeper the wound, the more glorious do they esteem the combat but
 when they find themselves tormented by some arrow-head or bullet
 lodged within, but presenting little outward show of wound,
 transported with shame and anger to perish by so imperceptible a
 destroyer, they fall to the ground."?-Livy, xxxviii. 21.]
</pre>
 <p>
 A pretty description of something very like an arquebuse-shot. The ten
 thousand Greeks in their long and famous retreat met with a nation who
 very much galled them with great and strong bows, carrying arrows so long
 that, taking them up, one might return them back like a dart, and with
 them pierce a buckler and an armed man through and through. The engines,
 that Dionysius invented at Syracuse to shoot vast massy darts and stones
 of a prodigious greatness with so great impetuosity and at so great a
 distance, came very near to our modern inventions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But in this discourse of horses and horsemanship, we are not to forget the
 pleasant posture of one Maistre Pierre Pol, a doctor of divinity, upon his
 mule, whom Monstrelet reports always to have ridden sideways through the
 streets of Paris like a woman. He says also, elsewhere, that the Gascons
 had terrible horses, that would wheel in their full speed, which the
 French, Picards, Flemings, and Brabanters looked upon as a miracle,
 "having never seen the like before," which are his very words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Caesar, speaking of the Suabians: "in the charges they make on horseback,"
 says he, "they often throw themselves off to fight on foot, having taught
 their horses not to stir in the meantime from the place, to which they
 presently run again upon occasion; and according to their custom, nothing
 is so unmanly and so base as to use saddles or pads, and they despise such
 as make use of those conveniences: insomuch that, being but a very few in
 number, they fear not to attack a great many." That which I have formerly
 wondered at, to see a horse made to perform all his airs with a switch
 only and the reins upon his neck, was common with the Massilians, who rid
 their horses without saddle or bridle:
 </p><br>

 King Alfonso,?[Alfonso XI., king of Leon and Castile, died 1350.]?
 he who first instituted the Order of the Band or Scarf in Spain, amongst
 other rules of the order, gave them this, that they should never ride mule
 or mulet, upon penalty of a mark of silver; this I had lately out of
 Guevara's Letters. Whoever gave these the title of Golden Epistles had
 another kind of opinion of them than I have. The Courtier says, that till
 his time it was a disgrace to a gentleman to ride on one of these
 creatures: but the Abyssinians, on the contrary, the nearer they are to
 the person of Prester John, love to be mounted upon large mules, for the
 greatest dignity and grandeur.

 Xenophon tells us, that the Assyrians were fain to keep their horses
 fettered in the stable, they were so fierce and vicious; and that it
 required so much time to loose and harness them, that to avoid any
 disorder this tedious preparation might bring upon them in case of
 surprise, they never sat down in their camp till it was first well
 fortified with ditches and ramparts. His Cyrus, who was so great a master
 in all manner of horse service, kept his horses to their due work, and
 never suffered them to have anything to eat till first they had earned it
 by the sweat of some kind of exercise. The Scythians when in the field and
 in scarcity of provisions used to let their horses blood, which they
 drank, and sustained themselves by that diet:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Venit et epoto Sarmata pastus equo."

 ["The Scythian comes, who feeds on horse-flesh"
 ?Martial, De Spectaculis Libey, Epigr. iii. 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Those of Crete, being besieged by Metellus, were in so great necessity for
 drink that they were fain to quench their thirst with their horses urine.?[Val.
 Max., vii. 6, ext. 1.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To shew how much cheaper the Turkish armies support themselves than our
 European forces, 'tis said that besides the soldiers drink nothing but
 water and eat nothing but rice and salt flesh pulverised (of which every
 one may easily carry about with him a month's provision), they know how to
 feed upon the blood of their horses as well as the Muscovite and Tartar,
 and salt it for their use.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These new-discovered people of the Indies [Mexico and Yucatan D.W.], when
 the Spaniards first landed amongst them, had so great an opinion both of
 the men and horses, that they looked upon the first as gods and the other
 as animals ennobled above their nature; insomuch that after they were
 subdued, coming to the men to sue for peace and pardon, and to bring them
 gold and provisions, they failed not to offer of the same to the horses,
 with the same kind of harangue to them they had made to the others:
 interpreting their neighing for a language of truce and friendship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the other Indies, to ride upon an elephant was the first and royal
 place of honour; the second to ride in a coach with four horses; the third
 to ride upon a camel; and the last and least honour to be carried or drawn
 by one horse only. Some one of our late writers tells us that he has been
 in countries in those parts where they ride upon oxen with pads, stirrups,
 and bridles, and very much at their ease.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, in a battle with the Samnites, seeing
 his horse, after three or four charges, had failed of breaking into the
 enemy's battalion, took this course, to make them unbridle all their
 horses and spur their hardest, so that having nothing to check their
 career, they might through weapons and men open the way to his foot, who
 by that means gave them a bloody defeat. The same command was given by
 Quintus Fulvius Flaccus against the Celtiberians:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["You will do your business with greater advantage of your horses'
 strength, if you send them unbridled upon the enemy, as it is
 recorded the Roman horse to their great glory have often done; their
 bits being taken off, they charged through and again back through
 the enemy's ranks with great slaughter, breaking down all their
 spears."?Idem, xl. 40.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The Duke of Muscovy was anciently obliged to pay this reverence to the
 Tartars, that when they sent an embassy to him he went out to meet them on
 foot, and presented them with a goblet of mares' milk (a beverage of
 greatest esteem amongst them), and if, in drinking, a drop fell by chance
 upon their horse's mane, he was bound to lick it off with his tongue. The
 army that Bajazet had sent into Russia was overwhelmed with so dreadful a
 tempest of snow, that to shelter and preserve themselves from the cold,
 many killed and embowelled their horses, to creep into their bellies and
 enjoy the benefit of that vital heat. Bajazet, after that furious battle
 wherein he was overthrown by Tamerlane, was in a hopeful way of securing
 his own person by the fleetness of an Arabian mare he had under him, had
 he not been constrained to let her drink her fill at the ford of a river
 in his way, which rendered her so heavy and indisposed, that he was
 afterwards easily overtaken by those that pursued him. They say, indeed,
 that to let a horse stale takes him off his mettle, but as to drinking, I
 should rather have thought it would refresh him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Croesus, marching his army through certain waste lands near Sardis, met
 with an infinite number of serpents, which the horses devoured with great
 appetite, and which Herodotus says was a prodigy of ominous portent to his
 affairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We call a horse entire, that has his mane and ears so, and no other will
 pass muster. The Lacedaemonians, having defeated the Athenians in Sicily,
 returning triumphant from the victory into the city of Syracuse, amongst
 other insolences, caused all the horses they had taken to be shorn and led
 in triumph. Alexander fought with a nation called Dahas, whose discipline
 it was to march two and two together armed on one horse, to the war; and
 being in fight, one of them alighted, and so they fought on horseback and
 on foot, one after another by turns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I do not think that for graceful riding any nation in the world excels the
 French. A good horseman, according to our way of speaking, seems rather to
 have respect to the courage of the man than address in riding. Of all that
 ever I saw, the most knowing in that art, who had the best seat and the
 best method in breaking horses, was Monsieur de Carnavalet, who served our
 King Henry II.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have seen a man ride with both his feet upon the saddle, take off his
 saddle, and at his return take it up again and replace it, riding all the
 while full speed; having galloped over a cap, make at it very good shots
 backwards with his bow; take up anything from the ground, setting one foot
 on the ground and the other in the stirrup: with twenty other ape's
 tricks, which he got his living by.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There has been seen in my time at Constantinople two men upon one horse,
 who, in the height of its speed, would throw themselves off and into the
 saddle again by turn; and one who bridled and saddled his horse with
 nothing but his teeth; an other who betwixt two horses, one foot upon one
 saddle and the other upon another, carrying the other man upon his
 shoulders, would ride full career, the other standing bolt upright upon
 and making very good shots with his bow; several who would ride full speed
 with their heels upward, and their heads upon the saddle betwixt several
 scimitars, with the points upwards, fixed in the harness. When I was a
 boy, the prince of Sulmona, riding an unbroken horse at Naples, prone to
 all sorts of action, held reals?[A small coin of Spain, the Two
 Sicilies, &amp;c.]?under his knees and toes, as if they had been
 nailed there, to shew the firmness of his seat.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XLIX??OF ANCIENT CUSTOMS
 </h2>
 <p>
 I should willingly pardon our people for admitting no other pattern or
 rule of perfection than their own peculiar manners and customs; for 'tis a
 common vice, not of the vulgar only, but almost of all men, to walk in the
 beaten road their ancestors have trod before them. I am content, when they
 see Fabricius or Laelius, that they look upon their countenance and
 behaviour as barbarous, seeing they are neither clothed nor fashioned
 according to our mode. But I find fault with their singular indiscretion
 in suffering themselves to be so blinded and imposed upon by the authority
 of the present usage as every month to alter their opinion, if custom so
 require, and that they should so vary their judgment in their own
 particular concern. When they wore the busk of their doublets up as high
 as their breasts, they stiffly maintained that they were in their proper
 place; some years after it was slipped down betwixt their thighs, and then
 they could laugh at the former fashion as uneasy and intolerable. The
 fashion now in use makes them absolutely condemn the other two with so
 great resolution and so universal consent, that a man would think there
 was a certain kind of madness crept in amongst them, that infatuates their
 understandings to this strange degree. Now, seeing that our change of
 fashions is so prompt and sudden, that the inventions of all the tailors
 in the world cannot furnish out new whim-whams enow to feed our vanity
 withal, there will often be a necessity that the despised forms must again
 come in vogue, these immediately after fall into the same contempt; and
 that the same judgment must, in the space of fifteen or twenty years, take
 up half-a-dozen not only divers but contrary opinions, with an incredible
 lightness and inconstancy; there is not any of us so discreet, who suffers
 not himself to be gulled with this contradiction, and both in external and
 internal sight to be insensibly blinded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I wish to muster up here some old customs that I have in memory, some of
 them the same with ours, the others different, to the end that, bearing in
 mind this continual variation of human things, we may have our judgment
 more clearly and firmly settled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thing in use amongst us of fighting with rapier and cloak was in
 practice amongst the Romans also:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sinistras sagis involvunt, gladiosque distringunt,"

 ["They wrapt their cloaks upon the left arm, and drew their
 swords."?De Bello Civili, i. 75.]
</pre>
 <p>
 says Caesar; and he observes a vicious custom of our nation, that
 continues yet amongst us, which is to stop passengers we meet upon the
 road, to compel them to give an account who they are, and to take it for
 an affront and just cause of quarrel if they refuse to do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the Baths, which the ancients made use of every day before they went to
 dinner, and as frequently as we wash our hands, they at first only bathed
 their arms and legs; but afterwards, and by a custom that has continued
 for many ages in most nations of the world, they bathed stark naked in
 mixed and perfumed water, looking upon it as a great simplicity to bathe
 in mere water. The most delicate and affected perfumed themselves all over
 three or four times a day. They often caused their hair to be pinched off,
 as the women of France have some time since taken up a custom to do their
 foreheads,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quod pectus, quod crura tibi, quod brachia veilis,"

 ["You pluck the hairs out of your breast, your arms, and thighs."
 ?Martial, ii. 62, i.]
</pre>
 <p>
 though they had ointments proper for that purpose:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Psilotro nitet, aut acids latet oblita creta."

 ["She shines with unguents, or with chalk dissolved in vinegar."
 ?Idem, vi. 93, 9.]
</pre>
 <p>
 They delighted to lie soft, and alleged it as a great testimony of
 hardiness to lie upon a mattress. They ate lying upon beds, much after the
 manner of the Turks in this age:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Inde thoro pater AEneas sic orsus ab alto."

 ["Thus Father AEneas, from his high bed of state, spoke."
 ?AEneid, ii. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And 'tis said of the younger Cato, that after the battle of Pharsalia,
 being entered into a melancholy disposition at the ill posture of the
 public affairs, he took his repasts always sitting, assuming a strict and
 austere course of life. It was also their custom to kiss the hands of
 great persons; the more to honour and caress them. And meeting with
 friends, they always kissed in salutation, as do the Venetians:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Gratatusque darem cum dulcibus oscula verbis."

 ["And kindest words I would mingle with kisses."
 ?Ovid, De Pont., iv. 9, 13]
</pre>
 <p>
 In petitioning or saluting any great man, they used to lay their hands
 upon his knees. Pasicles the philosopher, brother of Crates, instead of
 laying his hand upon the knee laid it upon the private parts, and being
 roughly repulsed by him to whom he made that indecent compliment: "What,"
 said he, "is not that part your own as well as the other?" ?[Diogenes
 Laertius, vi. 89.]?They used to eat fruit, as we do, after dinner.
 They wiped their fundaments (let the ladies, if they please, mince it
 smaller) with a sponge, which is the reason that 'spongia' is a smutty
 word in Latin; which sponge was fastened to the end of a stick, as appears
 by the story of him who, as he was led along to be thrown to the wild
 beasts in the sight of the people, asking leave to do his business, and
 having no other way to despatch himself, forced the sponge and stick down
 his throat and choked himself.?[Seneca, Ep., 70.] They used to wipe,
 after coition, with perfumed wool:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "At tibi nil faciam; sed Iota mentula lana."
</pre>
 <p>
 They had in the streets of Rome vessels and little tubs for passengers to
 urine in:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Pusi saepe lacum propter se, ac dolia curta.
 Somno devincti, credunt extollere vestem."

 ["The little boys in their sleep often think they are near the
 public urinal, and raise their coats to make use of it."
 ?Lucretius, iv.]
</pre>
 <p>
 They had collation betwixt meals, and had in summer cellars of snow to
 cool their wine; and some there were who made use of snow in winter, not
 thinking their wine cool enough, even at that cold season of the year. The
 men of quality had their cupbearers and carvers, and their buffoons to
 make them sport. They had their meat served up in winter upon chafing
 dishes, which were set upon the table, and had portable kitchens (of which
 I myself have seen some) wherein all their service was carried about with
 them:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Has vobis epulas habete, lauti
 Nos offendimur ambulante caena."

 ["Do you, if you please, esteem these feasts: we do not like the
 ambulatory suppers."?Martial, vii. 48, 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 In summer they had a contrivance to bring fresh and clear rills through
 their lower rooms, wherein were great store of living fish, which the
 guests took out with their own hands to be dressed every man according to
 his own liking. Fish has ever had this pre-eminence, and keeps it still,
 that the grandees, as to them, all pretend to be cooks; and indeed the
 taste is more delicate than that of flesh, at least to my fancy. But in
 all sorts of magnificence, debauchery, and voluptuous inventions of
 effeminacy and expense, we do, in truth, all we can to parallel them; for
 our wills are as corrupt as theirs: but we want ability to equal them. Our
 force is no more able to reach them in their vicious, than in their
 virtuous, qualities, for both the one and the other proceeded from a
 vigour of soul which was without comparison greater in them than in us;
 and souls, by how much the weaker they are, by so much have they less
 power to do either very well or very ill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The highest place of honour amongst them was the middle. The name going
 before, or following after, either in writing or speaking, had no
 signification of grandeur, as is evident by their writings; they will as
 soon say Oppius and Caesar, as Caesar and Oppius; and me and thee, as thee
 and me. This is the reason that made me formerly take notice in the life
 of Flaminius, in our French Plutarch, of one passage, where it seems as if
 the author, speaking of the jealousy of honour betwixt the AEtolians and
 Romans, about the winning of a battle they had with their joined forces
 obtained, made it of some importance, that in the Greek songs they had put
 the AEtolians before the Romans: if there be no amphibology in the words
 of the French translation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ladies, in their baths, made no scruple of admitting men amongst them,
 and moreover made use of their serving-men to rub and anoint them:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Inguina succinctus nigri tibi servus aluta
 Stat, quoties calidis nuda foveris aquis."

 ["A slave?his middle girded with a black apron?stands before you,
 when, naked, you take a hot bath."?Martial, vii. 35, i.]
</pre>
 <p>
 They all powdered themselves with a certain powder, to moderate their
 sweats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ancient Gauls, says Sidonius Apollinaris, wore their hair long before
 and the hinder part of the head shaved, a fashion that begins to revive in
 this vicious and effeminate age.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Romans used to pay the watermen their fare at their first stepping
 into the boat, which we never do till after landing:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Dum aes exigitur, dum mula ligatur,
 Tota abit hora."

 ["Whilst the fare's paying, and the mule is being harnessed, a whole
 hour's time is past."?Horace, Sat. i. 5, 13.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The women used to lie on the side of the bed next the wall: and for that
 reason they called Caesar,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Spondam regis Nicomedis,"

 ["The bed of King Nicomedes."?Suetonius, Life of Caesar, 49.]
</pre>
 <p>
 They took breath in their drinking, and watered their wine
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quis puer ocius
 Restinguet ardentis Falerni
 Pocula praetereunte lympha?"

 ["What boy will quickly come and cool the heat of the Falernian
 wine with clear water?"?Horace, Od., ii. z, 18.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And the roguish looks and gestures of our lackeys were also in use amongst
 them:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "O Jane, a tergo quern nulls ciconia pinsit,
 Nec manus, auriculas imitari est mobilis albas,
 Nec lingua, quantum sitiat canis Appula, tantum."

 ["O Janus, whom no crooked fingers, simulating a stork, peck at
 behind your back, whom no quick hands deride behind you, by
 imitating the motion of the white ears of the ass, against whom no
 mocking tongue is thrust out, as the tongue of the thirsty Apulian
 dog."?Persius, i. 58.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The Argian and Roman ladies mourned in white, as ours did formerly and
 should do still, were I to govern in this point. But there are whole books
 on this subject.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER L??OF DEMOCRITUS AND HERACLITUS
 </h2>
 <p>
 The judgment is an utensil proper for all subjects, and will have an oar
 in everything: which is the reason, that in these Essays I take hold of
 all occasions where, though it happen to be a subject I do not very well
 understand, I try, however, sounding it at a distance, and finding it too
 deep for my stature, I keep me on the shore; and this knowledge that a man
 can proceed no further, is one effect of its virtue, yes, one of those of
 which it is most proud. One while in an idle and frivolous subject, I try
 to find out matter whereof to compose a body, and then to prop and support
 it; another while, I employ it in a noble subject, one that has been
 tossed and tumbled by a thousand hands, wherein a man can scarce possibly
 introduce anything of his own, the way being so beaten on every side that
 he must of necessity walk in the steps of another: in such a case, 'tis
 the work of the judgment to take the way that seems best, and of a
 thousand paths, to determine that this or that is the best. I leave the
 choice of my arguments to fortune, and take that she first presents to me;
 they are all alike to me, I never design to go through any of them; for I
 never see all of anything: neither do they who so largely promise to show
 it others. Of a hundred members and faces that everything has, I take one,
 onewhile to look it over only, another while to ripple up the skin, and
 sometimes to pinch it to the bones: I give a stab, not so wide but as deep
 as I can, and am for the most part tempted to take it in hand by some new
 light I discover in it. Did I know myself less, I might perhaps venture to
 handle something or other to the bottom, and to be deceived in my own
 inability; but sprinkling here one word and there another, patterns cut
 from several pieces and scattered without design and without engaging
 myself too far, I am not responsible for them, or obliged to keep close to
 my subject, without varying at my own liberty and pleasure, and giving up
 myself to doubt and uncertainty, and to my own governing method,
 ignorance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All motion discovers us: the very same soul of Caesar, that made itself so
 conspicuous in marshalling and commanding the battle of Pharsalia, was
 also seen as solicitous and busy in the softer affairs of love and
 leisure. A man makes a judgment of a horse, not only by seeing him when he
 is showing off his paces, but by his very walk, nay, and by seeing him
 stand in the stable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Amongst the functions of the soul, there are some of a lower and meaner
 form; he who does not see her in those inferior offices as well as in
 those of nobler note, never fully discovers her; and, peradventure, she is
 best shown where she moves her simpler pace. The winds of passions take
 most hold of her in her highest flights; and the rather by reason that she
 wholly applies herself to, and exercises her whole virtue upon, every
 particular subject, and never handles more than one thing at a time, and
 that not according to it, but according to herself. Things in respect to
 themselves have, peradventure, their weight, measures, and conditions; but
 when we once take them into us, the soul forms them as she pleases. Death
 is terrible to Cicero, coveted by Cato, indifferent to Socrates. Health,
 conscience, authority, knowledge, riches, beauty, and their contraries,
 all strip themselves at their entering into us, and receive a new robe,
 and of another fashion, from the soul; and of what colour, brown, bright,
 green, dark, and of what quality, sharp, sweet, deep, or superficial, as
 best pleases each of them, for they are not agreed upon any common
 standard of forms, rules, or proceedings; every one is a queen in her own
 dominions. Let us, therefore, no more excuse ourselves upon the external
 qualities of things; it belongs to us to give ourselves an account of
 them. Our good or ill has no other dependence but on ourselves. 'Tis there
 that our offerings and our vows are due, and not to fortune she has no
 power over our manners; on the contrary, they draw and make her follow in
 their train, and cast her in their own mould. Why should not I judge of
 Alexander at table, ranting and drinking at the prodigious rate he
 sometimes used to do?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Or, if he played at chess? what string of his soul was not touched by this
 idle and childish game? I hate and avoid it, because it is not play
 enough, that it is too grave and serious a diversion, and I am ashamed to
 lay out as much thought and study upon it as would serve to much better
 uses. He did not more pump his brains about his glorious expedition into
 the Indies, nor than another in unravelling a passage upon which depends
 the safety of mankind. To what a degree does this ridiculous diversion
 molest the soul, when all her faculties are summoned together upon this
 trivial account! and how fair an opportunity she herein gives every one to
 know and to make a right judgment of himself? I do not more thoroughly
 sift myself in any other posture than this: what passion are we exempted
 from in it? Anger, spite, malice, impatience, and a vehement desire of
 getting the better in a concern wherein it were more excusable to be
 ambitious of being overcome; for to be eminent, to excel above the common
 rate in frivolous things, nowise befits a man of honour. What I say in
 this example may be said in all others. Every particle, every employment
 of man manifests him equally with any other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Democritus and Heraclitus were two philosophers, of whom the first,
 finding human condition ridiculous and vain, never appeared abroad but
 with a jeering and laughing countenance; whereas Heraclitus commiserating
 that same condition of ours, appeared always with a sorrowful look, and
 tears in his eyes:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Alter
 Ridebat, quoties a limine moverat unum
 Protuleratque pedem; flebat contrarius alter."

 ["The one always, as often as he had stepped one pace from his
 threshold, laughed, the other always wept."?Juvenal, Sat., x. 28.]

 [Or, as Voltaire: "Life is a comedy to those who think;
 a tragedy to those who feel." D.W.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I am clearly for the first humour; not because it is more pleasant to
 laugh than to weep, but because it expresses more contempt and
 condemnation than the other, and I think we can never be despised
 according to our full desert. Compassion and bewailing seem to imply some
 esteem of and value for the thing bemoaned; whereas the things we laugh at
 are by that expressed to be of no moment. I do not think that we are so
 unhappy as we are vain, or have in us so much malice as folly; we are not
 so full of mischief as inanity; nor so miserable as we are vile and mean.
 And therefore Diogenes, who passed away his time in rolling himself in his
 tub, and made nothing of the great Alexander, esteeming us no better than
 flies or bladders puffed up with wind, was a sharper and more penetrating,
 and, consequently in my opinion, a juster judge than Timon, surnamed the
 Man-hater; for what a man hates he lays to heart. This last was an enemy
 to all mankind, who passionately desired our ruin, and avoided our
 conversation as dangerous, proceeding from wicked and depraved natures:
 the other valued us so little that we could neither trouble nor infect him
 by our example; and left us to herd one with another, not out of fear, but
 from contempt of our society: concluding us as incapable of doing good as
 evil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of the same strain was Statilius' answer, when Brutus courted him into the
 conspiracy against Caesar; he was satisfied that the enterprise was just,
 but he did not think mankind worthy of a wise man's concern'; according to
 the doctrine of Hegesias, who said, that a wise man ought to do nothing
 but for himself, forasmuch as he only was worthy of it: and to the saying
 of Theodorus, that it was not reasonable a wise man should hazard himself
 for his country, and endanger wisdom for a company of fools. Our condition
 is as ridiculous as risible.

 CHAPTER LI??OF THE VANITY OF WORDS
 </h2>
 <p>
 A rhetorician of times past said, that to make little things appear great
 was his profession. This was a shoemaker, who can make a great shoe for a
 little foot.?[A saying of Agesilaus.]?They would in Sparta
 have sent such a fellow to be whipped for making profession of a tricky
 and deceitful act; and I fancy that Archidamus, who was king of that
 country, was a little surprised at the answer of Thucydides, when
 inquiring of him, which was the better wrestler, Pericles, or he, he
 replied, that it was hard to affirm; for when I have thrown him, said he,
 he always persuades the spectators that he had no fall and carries away
 the prize. ?[Quintilian, ii. 15.]?The women who paint, pounce,
 and plaster up their ruins, filling up their wrinkles and deformities, are
 less to blame, because it is no great matter whether we see them in their
 natural complexions; whereas these make it their business to deceive not
 our sight only but our judgments, and to adulterate and corrupt the very
 essence of things. The republics that have maintained themselves in a
 regular and well-modelled government, such as those of Lacedaemon and
 Crete, had orators in no very great esteem. Aristo wisely defined rhetoric
 to be "a science to persuade the people;" Socrates and Plato "an art to
 flatter and deceive." And those who deny it in the general description,
 verify it throughout in their precepts. The Mohammedans will not suffer
 their children to be instructed in it, as being useless, and the
 Athenians, perceiving of how pernicious consequence the practice of it
 was, it being in their city of universal esteem, ordered the principal
 part, which is to move the affections, with their exordiums and
 perorations, to be taken away. 'Tis an engine invented to manage and
 govern a disorderly and tumultuous rabble, and that never is made use of,
 but like physic to the sick, in a discomposed state. In those where the
 vulgar or the ignorant, or both together, have been all-powerful and able
 to give the law, as in those of Athens, Rhodes, and Rome, and where the
 public affairs have been in a continual tempest of commotion, to such
 places have the orators always repaired. And in truth, we shall find few
 persons in those republics who have pushed their fortunes to any great
 degree of eminence without the assistance of eloquence.

 <p>
 Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, Lucullus, Lentulus, Metellus, thence took their
 chiefest spring, to mount to that degree of authority at which they at
 last arrived, making it of greater use to them than arms, contrary to the
 opinion of better times; for, L. Volumnius speaking publicly in favour of
 the election of Q. Fabius and Pub. Decius, to the consular dignity: "These
 are men," said he, "born for war and great in execution; in the combat of
 the tongue altogether wanting; spirits truly consular. The subtle,
 eloquent, and learned are only good for the city, to make praetors of, to
 administer justice."?[Livy, x. 22.]
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eloquence most flourished at Rome when the public affairs were in the
 worst condition and most disquieted with intestine commotions; as a free
 and untilled soil bears the worst weeds. By which it should seem that a
 monarchical government has less need of it than any other: for the
 stupidity and facility natural to the common people, and that render them
 subject to be turned and twined and, led by the ears by this charming
 harmony of words, without weighing or considering the truth and reality of
 things by the force of reason: this facility, I say, is not easily found
 in a single person, and it is also more easy by good education and advice
 to secure him from the impression of this poison. There was never any
 famous orator known to come out of Persia or Macedon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have entered into this discourse upon the occasion of an Italian I
 lately received into my service, and who was clerk of the kitchen to the
 late Cardinal Caraffa till his death. I put this fellow upon an account of
 his office: when he fell to discourse of this palate-science, with such a
 settled countenance and magisterial gravity, as if he had been handling
 some profound point of divinity. He made a learned distinction of the
 several sorts of appetites; of that a man has before he begins to eat, and
 of those after the second and third service; the means simply to satisfy
 the first, and then to raise and actuate the other two; the ordering of
 the sauces, first in general, and then proceeded to the qualities of the
 ingredients and their effects; the differences of salads according to
 their seasons, those which ought to be served up hot, and which cold; the
 manner of their garnishment and decoration to render them acceptable to
 the eye. After which he entered upon the order of the whole service, full
 of weighty and important considerations:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nec minimo sane discrimine refert,
 Quo gestu lepores, et quo gallina secetur;"

 ["Nor with less discrimination observes how we should carve a hare,
 and how a hen." or, ("Nor with the least discrimination relates how
 we should carve hares, and how cut up a hen.)"
 ?Juvenal, Sat., v. 123.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and all this set out with lofty and magnificent words, the very same we
 make use of when we discourse of the government of an empire. Which
 learned lecture of my man brought this of Terence into my memory:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Hoc salsum est, hoc adustum est, hoc lautum est, parum:
 Illud recte: iterum sic memento: sedulo
 Moneo, qux possum, pro mea sapientia.
 Postremo, tanquam in speculum, in patinas,
 Demea, Inspicere jubeo, et moneo, quid facto usus sit."

 ["This is too salt, that's burnt, that's not washed enough; that's
 well; remember to do so another time. Thus do I ever advise them to
 have things done properly, according to my capacity; and lastly,
 Demea, I command my cooks to look into every dish as if it were a
 mirror, and tell them what they should do."
 ?Terence, Adelph., iii. 3, 71.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And yet even the Greeks themselves very much admired and highly applauded
 the order and disposition that Paulus AEmilius observed in the feast he
 gave them at his return from Macedon. But I do not here speak of effects,
 I speak of words only.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I do not know whether it may have the same operation upon other men that
 it has upon me, but when I hear our architects thunder out their bombast
 words of pilasters, architraves, and cornices, of the Corinthian and Doric
 orders, and suchlike jargon, my imagination is presently possessed with
 the palace of Apollidon; when, after all, I find them but the paltry
 pieces of my own kitchen door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To hear men talk of metonomies, metaphors, and allegories, and other
 grammar words, would not one think they signified some rare and exotic
 form of speaking? And yet they are phrases that come near to the babble of
 my chambermaid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And this other is a gullery of the same stamp, to call the offices of our
 kingdom by the lofty titles of the Romans, though they have no similitude
 of function, and still less of authority and power. And this also, which I
 doubt will one day turn to the reproach of this age of ours, unworthily
 and indifferently to confer upon any we think fit the most glorious
 surnames with which antiquity honoured but one or two persons in several
 ages. Plato carried away the surname of Divine, by so universal a consent
 that never any one repined at it, or attempted to take it from him; and
 yet the Italians, who pretend, and with good reason, to more sprightly
 wits and sounder sense than the other nations of their time, have lately
 bestowed the same title upon Aretin, in whose writings, save tumid phrases
 set out with smart periods, ingenious indeed but far-fetched and
 fantastic, and the eloquence, be it what it may, I see nothing in him
 above the ordinary writers of his time, so far is he from approaching the
 ancient divinity. And we make nothing of giving the surname of great to
 princes who have nothing more than ordinary in them.

 CHAPTER LII??OF THE PARSIMONY OF THE ANCIENTS
 </h2>
 <p>
 Attilius Regulus, general of the Roman army in Africa, in the height of
 all his glory and victories over the Carthaginians, wrote to the Republic
 to acquaint them that a certain hind he had left in trust with his estate,
 which was in all but seven acres of land, had run away with all his
 instruments of husbandry, and entreating therefore, that they would please
 to call him home that he might take order in his own affairs, lest his
 wife and children should suffer by this disaster. Whereupon the Senate
 appointed another to manage his business, caused his losses to be made
 good, and ordered his family to be maintained at the public expense.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elder Cato, returning consul from Spain, sold his warhorse to save the
 money it would have cost in bringing it back by sea into Italy; and being
 Governor of Sardinia, he made all his visits on foot, without other train
 than one officer of the Republic who carried his robe and a censer for
 sacrifices, and for the most part carried his trunk himself. He bragged
 that he had never worn a gown that cost above ten crowns, nor had ever
 sent above tenpence to the market for one day's provision; and that as to
 his country houses, he had not one that was rough-cast on the outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Scipio AEmilianus, after two triumphs and two consulships, went an embassy
 with no more than seven servants in his train. 'Tis said that Homer had
 never more than one, Plato three, and Zeno, founder of the sect of Stoics,
 none at all. Tiberius Gracchus was allowed but fivepence halfpenny a day
 when employed as public minister about the public affairs, and being at
 that time the greatest man of Rome.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER LIII??OF A SAYING OF CAESAR
 </h2>
 <p>
 If we would sometimes bestow a little consideration upon ourselves, and
 employ the time we spend in prying into other men's actions, and
 discovering things without us, in examining our own abilities we should
 soon perceive of how infirm and decaying material this fabric of ours is
 composed. Is it not a singular testimony of imperfection that we cannot
 establish our satisfaction in any one thing, and that even our own fancy
 and desire should deprive us of the power to choose what is most proper
 and useful for us? A very good proof of this is the great dispute that has
 ever been amongst the philosophers, of finding out man's sovereign good,
 that continues yet, and will eternally continue, without solution or
 accord:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Dum abest quod avemus, id exsuperare videtur
 Caetera; post aliud, quum contigit illud, avemus,
 Et sitis aequa tenet."

 ["While that which we desire is wanting, it seems to surpass all the
 rest; then, when we have got it, we want something else; 'tis ever
 the same thirst"?Lucretius, iii. 1095.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Whatever it is that falls into our knowledge and possession, we find that
 it satisfies not, and we still pant after things to come and unknown,
 inasmuch as those present do not suffice for us; not that, in my judgment,
 they have not in them wherewith to do it, but because we seize them with
 an unruly and immoderate haste:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nam quum vidit hic, ad victum qux flagitat usus,
 Et per quae possent vitam consistere tutam,
 Omnia jam ferme mortalibus esse parata;
 Divitiis homines, et honore, et laude potentes
 Aflluere, atque bona natorum excellere fama;
 Nec minus esse domi cuiquam tamen anxia corda,
 Atque animi ingratis vitam vexare querelis
 Causam, quae infestis cogit saevire querelis,
 Intellegit ibi; vitium vas efficere ipsum,
 Omniaque, illius vitio, corrumpier intus,
 Qux collata foris et commoda quomque venirent."

 ["For when he saw that almost all things necessarily required for
 subsistence, and which may render life comfortable, are already
 prepared to their hand, that men may abundantly attain wealth,
 honour, praise, may rejoice in the reputation of their children, yet
 that, notwithstanding, every one has none the less in his heart and
 home anxieties and a mind enslaved by wearing complaints, he saw
 that the vessel itself was in fault, and that all good things which
 were brought into it from without were spoilt by its own
 imperfections."?Lucretius, vi. 9.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Our appetite is irresolute and fickle; it can neither keep nor enjoy
 anything with a good grace: and man concluding it to be the fault of the
 things he is possessed of, fills himself with and feeds upon the idea of
 things he neither knows nor understands, to which he devotes his hopes and
 his desires, paying them all reverence and honour, according to the saying
 of Caesar:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Communi fit vitio naturae, ut invisis, latitantibus
 atque incognitis rebus magis confidamas,
 vehementiusque exterreamur."

 confidence, and receive the greatest apprehensions, from things
 unseen, concealed, and unknown."?De Bello Civil, xi. 4.]

 <h2>
 CHAPTER LIV??OF VAIN SUBTLETIES
 </h2>
 <p>
 There are a sort of little knacks and frivolous subtleties from which men
 sometimes expect to derive reputation and applause: as poets, who compose
 whole poems with every line beginning with the same letter; we see the
 shapes of eggs, globes, wings, and hatchets cut out by the ancient Greeks
 by the measure of their verses, making them longer or shorter, to
 represent such or such a figure. Of this nature was his employment who
 made it his business to compute into how many several orders the letters
 of the alphabet might be transposed, and found out that incredible number
 mentioned in Plutarch. I am mightily pleased with the humour of him,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["Alexander, as may be seen in Quintil., Institut. Orat., lib.
 ii., cap. 20, where he defines Maratarexvia to be a certain
 unnecessary imitation of art, which really does neither good nor
 harm, but is as unprofitable and ridiculous as was the labour of
 that man who had so perfectly learned to cast small peas through the
 eye of a needle at a good distance that he never missed one, and was
 justly rewarded for it, as is said, by Alexander, who saw the
 performance, with a bushel of peas."?Coste.]
</pre>
 <p>
 who having a man brought before him that had learned to throw a grain of
 millet with such dexterity and assurance as never to miss the eye of a
 needle; and being afterwards entreated to give something for the reward of
 so rare a performance, he pleasantly, and in my opinion justly, ordered a
 certain number of bushels of the same grain to be delivered to him, that
 he might not want wherewith to exercise so famous an art. 'Tis a strong
 evidence of a weak judgment when men approve of things for their being
 rare and new, or for their difficulty, where worth and usefulness are not
 conjoined to recommend them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I come just now from playing with my own family at who could find out the
 most things that hold by their two extremities; as Sire, which is a title
 given to the greatest person in the nation, the king, and also to the
 vulgar, as merchants, but never to any degree of men between. The women of
 great quality are called Dames, inferior gentlewomen, Demoiselles, and the
 meanest sort of women, Dames, as the first. The cloth of state over our
 tables is not permitted but in the palaces of princes and in taverns.
 Democritus said, that gods and beasts had sharper sense than men, who are
 of a middle form. The Romans wore the same habit at funerals and feasts.
 It is most certain that an extreme fear and an extreme ardour of courage
 equally trouble and relax the belly. The nickname of Trembling with which
 they surnamed Sancho XII., king of Navarre, tells us that valour will
 cause a trembling in the limbs as well as fear. Those who were arming that
 king, or some other person, who upon the like occasion was wont to be in
 the same disorder, tried to compose him by representing the danger less he
 was going to engage himself in: "You understand me ill," said he, "for
 could my flesh know the danger my courage will presently carry it into, it
 would sink down to the ground." The faintness that surprises us from
 frigidity or dislike in the exercises of Venus are also occasioned by a
 too violent desire and an immoderate heat. Extreme coldness and extreme
 heat boil and roast. Aristotle says, that sows of lead will melt and run
 with cold and the rigour of winter just as with a vehement heat. Desire
 and satiety fill all the gradations above and below pleasure with pain.
 Stupidity and wisdom meet in the same centre of sentiment and resolution,
 in the suffering of human accidents. The wise control and triumph over
 ill, the others know it not: these last are, as a man may say, on this
 side of accidents, the others are beyond them, who after having well
 weighed and considered their qualities, measured and judged them what they
 are, by virtue of a vigorous soul leap out of their reach; they disdain
 and trample them underfoot, having a solid and well-fortified soul,
 against which the darts of fortune, coming to strike, must of necessity
 rebound and blunt themselves, meeting with a body upon which they can fix
 no impression; the ordinary and middle condition of men are lodged betwixt
 these two extremities, consisting of such as perceive evils, feel them,
 and are not able to support them. Infancy and decrepitude meet in the
 imbecility of the brain; avarice and profusion in the same thirst and
 desire of getting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man may say with some colour of truth that there is an Abecedarian
 ignorance that precedes knowledge, and a doctoral ignorance that comes
 after it: an ignorance that knowledge creates and begets, at the same time
 that it despatches and destroys the first. Of mean understandings, little
 inquisitive, and little instructed, are made good Christians, who by
 reverence and obedience simply believe and are constant in their belief.
 In the average understandings and the middle sort of capacities, the error
 of opinion is begotten; they follow the appearance of the first
 impression, and have some colour of reason on their side to impute our
 walking on in the old beaten path to simplicity and stupidity, meaning us
 who have not informed ourselves by study. The higher and nobler souls,
 more solid and clear-sighted, make up another sort of true believers, who
 by a long and religious investigation of truth, have obtained a clearer
 and more penetrating light into the Scriptures, and have discovered the
 mysterious and divine secret of our ecclesiastical polity; and yet we see
 some, who by the middle step, have arrived at that supreme degree with
 marvellous fruit and confirmation, as to the utmost limit of Christian
 intelligence, and enjoy their victory with great spiritual consolation,
 humble acknowledgment of the divine favour, reformation of manners, and
 singular modesty. I do not intend with these to rank those others, who to
 clear themselves from all suspicion of their former errors and to satisfy
 us that they are sound and firm, render themselves extremely indiscreet
 and unjust, in the carrying on our cause, and blemish it with infinite
 reproaches of violence and oppression. The simple peasants are good
 people, and so are the philosophers, or whatever the present age calls
 them, men of strong and clear reason, and whose souls are enriched with an
 ample instruction of profitable sciences. The mongrels who have disdained
 the first form of the ignorance of letters, and have not been able to
 attain to the other (sitting betwixt two stools, as I and a great many
 more of us do), are dangerous, foolish, and importunate; these are they
 that trouble the world. And therefore it is that I, for my own part,
 retreat as much as I can towards the first and natural station, whence I
 so vainly attempted to advance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Popular and purely natural poesy
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["The term poesie populaire was employed, for the first time, in the
 French language on this occasion. Montaigne created the expression,
 and indicated its nature."?Ampere.]
</pre>
 <p>
 has in it certain artless graces, by which she may come into comparison
 with the greatest beauty of poetry perfected by art: as we see in our
 Gascon villanels and the songs that are brought us from nations that have
 no knowledge of any manner of science, nor so much as the use of writing.
 The middle sort of poesy betwixt these two is despised, of no value,
 honour, or esteem.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But seeing that the path once laid open to the fancy, I have found, as it
 commonly falls out, that what we have taken for a difficult exercise and a
 rare subject, prove to be nothing so, and that after the invention is once
 warm, it finds out an infinite number of parallel examples. I shall only
 add this one?that, were these Essays of mine considerable enough to
 deserve a critical judgment, it might then, I think, fall out that they
 would not much take with common and vulgar capacities, nor be very
 acceptable to the singular and excellent sort of men; the first would not
 understand them enough, and the last too much; and so they may hover in
 the middle region.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER LV??OF SMELLS
 </h2>
 <p>
 It has been reported of some, as of Alexander the Great, that their sweat
 exhaled an odoriferous smell, occasioned by some rare and extraordinary
 constitution, of which Plutarch and others have been inquisitive into the
 cause. But the ordinary constitution of human bodies is quite otherwise,
 and their best and chiefest excellency is to be exempt from smell. Nay,
 the sweetness even of the purest breath has nothing in it of greater
 perfection than to be without any offensive smell, like those of healthful
 children, which made Plautus say of a woman:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Mulier tum bene olet, ubi nihil olet."

 ["She smells sweetest, who smells not at all."
 ?Plautus, Mostel, i. 3, 116.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And such as make use of fine exotic perfumes are with good reason to be
 suspected of some natural imperfection which they endeavour by these
 odours to conceal. To smell, though well, is to stink:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Rides nos, Coracine, nil olentes
 Malo, quam bene olere, nil olere."

 ["You laugh at us, Coracinus, because we are not scented; I would,
 rather than smell well, not smell at all."?Martial, vi. 55, 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And elsewhere:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Posthume, non bene olet, qui bene semper olet."

 ["Posthumus, he who ever smells well does not smell well."
 ?Idem, ii. 12, 14.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I am nevertheless a great lover of good smells, and as much abominate the
 ill ones, which also I scent at a greater distance, I think, than other
 men:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Namque sagacius unus odoror,
 Polypus, an gravis hirsutis cubet hircus in aliis
 Quam canis acer, ubi latest sus."

 ["My nose is quicker to scent a fetid sore or a rank armpit, than a
 dog to smell out the hidden sow."?Horace, Epod., xii. 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Of smells, the simple and natural seem to me the most pleasing. Let the
 ladies look to that, for 'tis chiefly their concern: amid the most
 profound barbarism, the Scythian women, after bathing, were wont to powder
 and crust their faces and all their bodies with a certain odoriferous drug
 growing in their country, which being cleansed off, when they came to have
 familiarity with men they were found perfumed and sleek. 'Tis not to be
 believed how strangely all sorts of odours cleave to me, and how apt my
 skin is to imbibe them. He that complains of nature that she has not
 furnished mankind with a vehicle to convey smells to the nose had no
 reason; for they will do it themselves, especially to me; my very
 mustachios, which are full, perform that office; for if I stroke them but
 with my gloves or handkerchief, the smell will not out a whole day; they
 manifest where I have been, and the close, luscious, devouring, viscid
 melting kisses of youthful ardour in my wanton age left a sweetness upon
 my lips for several hours after. And yet I have ever found myself little
 subject to epidemic diseases, that are caught, either by conversing with
 the sick or bred by the contagion of the air, and have escaped from those
 of my time, of which there have been several sorts in our cities and
 armies. We read of Socrates, that though he never departed from Athens
 during the frequent plagues that infested the city, he only was never
 infected.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Physicians might, I believe, extract greater utility from odours than they
 do, for I have often observed that they cause an alteration in me and work
 upon my spirits according to their several virtues; which makes me approve
 of what is said, that the use of incense and perfumes in churches, so
 ancient and so universally received in all nations and religions, was
 intended to cheer us, and to rouse and purify the senses, the better to
 fit us for contemplation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could have been glad, the better to judge of it, to have tasted the
 culinary art of those cooks who had so rare a way of seasoning exotic
 odours with the relish of meats; as it was particularly observed in the
 service of the king of Tunis, who in our days?[Muley-Hassam, in
 1543.] ?landed at Naples to have an interview with Charles the
 Emperor. His dishes were larded with odoriferous drugs, to that degree of
 expense that the cookery of one peacock and two pheasants amounted to a
 hundred ducats to dress them after their fashion; and when the carver came
 to cut them up, not only the dining-room, but all the apartments of his
 palace and the adjoining streets were filled with an aromatic vapour which
 did not presently vanish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My chiefest care in choosing my lodgings is always to avoid a thick and
 stinking air; and those beautiful cities, Venice and Paris, very much
 lessen the kindness I have for them, the one by the offensive smell of her
 marshes, and the other of her dirt.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER LVI??OF PRAYERS
 </h2>
 <p>
 I propose formless and undetermined fancies, like those who publish
 doubtful questions, to be after a disputed upon in the schools, not to
 establish truth but to seek it; and I submit them to the judgments of
 those whose office it is to regulate, not my writings and actions only,
 but moreover my very thoughts. Let what I here set down meet with
 correction or applause, it shall be of equal welcome and utility to me,
 myself beforehand condemning as absurd and impious, if anything shall be
 found, through ignorance or inadvertency, couched in this rhapsody,
 contrary to the holy resolutions and prescriptions of the Catholic
 Apostolic and Roman Church, into which I was born and in which I will die.
 And yet, always submitting to the authority of their censure, which has an
 absolute power over me, I thus rashly venture at everything, as in
 treating upon this present subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I know not if or no I am wrong, but since, by a particular favour of the
 divine bounty, a certain form of prayer has been prescribed and dictated
 to us, word by word, from the mouth of God Himself, I have ever been of
 opinion that we ought to have it in more frequent use than we yet have;
 and if I were worthy to advise, at the sitting down to and rising from our
 tables, at our rising from and going to bed, and in every particular
 action wherein prayer is used, I would that Christians always make use of
 the Lord's Prayer, if not alone, yet at least always. The Church may
 lengthen and diversify prayers, according to the necessity of our
 instruction, for I know very well that it is always the same in substance
 and the same thing: but yet such a privilege ought to be given to that
 prayer, that the people should have it continually in their mouths; for it
 is most certain that all necessary petitions are comprehended in it, and
 that it is infinitely proper for all occasions. 'Tis the only prayer I use
 in all places and conditions, and which I still repeat instead of
 changing; whence it also happens that I have no other so entirely by heart
 as that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It just now came into my mind, whence it is we should derive that error of
 having recourse to God in all our designs and enterprises, to call Him to
 our assistance in all sorts of affairs, and in all places where our
 weakness stands in need of support, without considering whether the
 occasion be just or otherwise; and to invoke His name and power, in what
 state soever we are, or action we are engaged in, howsoever vicious. He is
 indeed, our sole and unique protector, and can do all things for us: but
 though He is pleased to honour us with this sweet paternal alliance, He
 is, notwithstanding, as just as He is good and mighty; and more often
 exercises His justice than His power, and favours us according to that,
 and not according to our petitions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plato in his Laws, makes three sorts of belief injurious to the gods;
 "that there are none; that they concern not themselves about our affairs;
 that they never refuse anything to our vows, offerings, and sacrifices."
 The first of these errors (according to his opinion, never continued
 rooted in any man from his infancy to his old age); the other two, he
 confesses, men might be obstinate in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 God's justice and His power are inseparable; 'tis in vain we invoke His
 power in an unjust cause. We are to have our souls pure and clean, at that
 moment at least wherein we pray to Him, and purified from all vicious
 passions; otherwise we ourselves present Him the rods wherewith to
 chastise us; instead of repairing anything we have done amiss, we double
 the wickedness and the offence when we offer to Him, to whom we are to sue
 for pardon, an affection full of irreverence and hatred. Which makes me
 not very apt to applaud those whom I observe to be so frequent on their
 knees, if the actions nearest to the prayer do not give me some evidence
 of amendment and reformation:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si, nocturnus adulter,
 Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo."

 ["If a night adulterer, thou coverest thy head with a Santonic
 cowl."?Juvenal, Sat., viii. 144.?The Santones were the people
 who inhabited Saintonge in France, from whom the Romans derived the
 use of hoods or cowls covering the head and face.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And the practice of a man who mixes devotion with an execrable life seems
 in some sort more to be condemned than that of a man conformable to his
 own propension and dissolute throughout; and for that reason it is that
 our Church denies admittance to and communion with men obstinate and
 incorrigible in any notorious wickedness. We pray only by custom and for
 fashion's sake; or rather, we read or pronounce our prayers aloud, which
 is no better than an hypocritical show of devotion; and I am scandalised
 to see a man cross himself thrice at the Benedicite, and as often at Grace
 (and the more, because it is a sign I have in great veneration and
 continual use, even when I yawn), and to dedicate all the other hours of
 the day to acts of malice, avarice, and injustice. One hour to God, the
 rest to the devil, as if by composition and compensation. 'Tis a wonder to
 see actions so various in themselves succeed one another with such an
 uniformity of method as not to interfere nor suffer any alteration, even
 upon the very confines and passes from the one to the other. What a
 prodigious conscience must that be that can be at quiet within itself
 whilst it harbours under the same roof, with so agreeing and so calm a
 society, both the crime and the judge?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man whose whole meditation is continually working upon nothing but
 impurity which he knows to be so odious to Almighty God, what can he say
 when he comes to speak to Him? He draws back, but immediately falls into a
 relapse. If the object of divine justice and the presence of his Maker
 did, as he pretends, strike and chastise his soul, how short soever the
 repentance might be, the very fear of offending the Infinite Majesty would
 so often present itself to his imagination that he would soon see himself
 master of those vices that are most natural and vehement in him. But what
 shall we say of those who settle their whole course of life upon the
 profit and emolument of sins, which they know to be mortal? How many
 trades and vocations have we admitted and countenanced amongst us, whose
 very essence is vicious? And he that, confessing himself to me,
 voluntarily told me that he had all his lifetime professed and practised a
 religion, in his opinion damnable and contrary to that he had in his
 heart, only to preserve his credit and the honour of his employments, how
 could his courage suffer so infamous a confession? What can men say to the
 divine justice upon this subject?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their repentance consisting in a visible and manifest reparation, they
 lose the colour of alleging it both to God and man. Are they so impudent
 as to sue for remission without satisfaction and without penitence? I look
 upon these as in the same condition with the first: but the obstinacy is
 not there so easy to be overcome. This contrariety and volubility of
 opinion so sudden, so violent, that they feign, are a kind of miracle to
 me: they present us with the state of an indigestible agony of mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It seemed to me a fantastic imagination in those who, these late years
 past, were wont to reproach every man they knew to be of any extraordinary
 parts, and made profession of the Catholic religion, that it was but
 outwardly; maintaining, moreover, to do him honour forsooth, that whatever
 he might pretend to the contrary he could not but in his heart be of their
 reformed opinion. An untoward disease, that a man should be so riveted to
 his own belief as to fancy that others cannot believe otherwise than as he
 does; and yet worse, that they should entertain so vicious an opinion of
 such great parts as to think any man so qualified, should prefer any
 present advantage of fortune to the promises of eternal life and the
 menaces of eternal damnation. They may believe me: could anything have
 tempted my youth, the ambition of the danger and difficulties in the late
 commotions had not been the least motives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is not without very good reason, in my opinion, that the Church
 interdicts the promiscuous, indiscreet, and irreverent use of the holy and
 divine Psalms, with which the Holy Ghost inspired King David. We ought not
 to mix God in our actions, but with the highest reverence and caution;
 that poesy is too holy to be put to no other use than to exercise the
 lungs and to delight our ears; it ought to come from the conscience, and
 not from the tongue. It is not fit that a prentice in his shop, amongst
 his vain and frivolous thoughts, should be permitted to pass away his time
 and divert himself with such sacred things. Neither is it decent to see
 the Holy Book of the holy mysteries of our belief tumbled up and down a
 hall or a kitchen they were formerly mysteries, but are now become sports
 and recreations. 'Tis a book too serious and too venerable to be cursorily
 or slightly turned over: the reading of the scripture ought to be a
 temperate and premeditated act, and to which men should always add this
 devout preface, 'sursum corda', preparing even the body to so humble and
 composed a gesture and countenance as shall evidence a particular
 veneration and attention. Neither is it a book for everyone to fist, but
 the study of select men set apart for that purpose, and whom Almighty God
 has been pleased to call to that office and sacred function: the wicked
 and ignorant grow worse by it. 'Tis, not a story to tell, but a history to
 revere, fear, and adore. Are not they then pleasant men who think they
 have rendered this fit for the people's handling by translating it into
 the vulgar tongue? Does the understanding of all therein contained only
 stick at words? Shall I venture to say further, that by coming so near to
 understand a little, they are much wider of the whole scope than before. A
 pure and simple ignorance and wholly depending upon the exposition of
 qualified persons, was far more learned and salutary than this vain and
 verbal knowledge, which has only temerity and presumption.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And I do further believe that the liberty every one has taken to disperse
 the sacred writ into so many idioms carries with it a great deal more of
 danger than utility. The Jews, Mohammedans, and almost all other peoples,
 have reverentially espoused the language wherein their mysteries were
 first conceived, and have expressly, and not without colour of reason,
 forbidden the alteration of them into any other. Are we assured that in
 Biscay and in Brittany there are enough competent judges of this affair to
 establish this translation into their own language? The universal Church
 has not a more difficult and solemn judgment to make. In preaching and
 speaking the interpretation is vague, free, mutable, and of a piece by
 itself; so 'tis not the same thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of our Greek historians age justly censures the he lived in, because
 the secrets of the Christian religion were dispersed into the hands of
 every mechanic, to expound and argue upon, according to his own fancy, and
 that we ought to be much ashamed, we who by God's especial favour enjoy
 the pure mysteries of piety, to suffer them to be profaned by the ignorant
 rabble; considering that the Gentiles expressly forbad Socrates, Plato,
 and the other sages to inquire into or so much as mention the things
 committed to the priests of Delphi; and he says, moreover, that the
 factions of princes upon theological subjects are armed not with zeal but
 fury; that zeal springs from the divine wisdom and justice, and governs
 itself with prudence and moderation, but degenerates into hatred and envy,
 producing tares and nettles instead of corn and wine when conducted by
 human passions. And it was truly said by another, who, advising the
 Emperor Theodosius, told him that disputes did not so much rock the
 schisms of the Church asleep, as it roused and animated heresies; that,
 therefore, all contentions and dialectic disputations were to be avoided,
 and men absolutely to acquiesce in the prescriptions and formulas of faith
 established by the ancients. And the Emperor Andronicus having overheard
 some great men at high words in his palace with Lapodius about a point of
 ours of great importance, gave them so severe a check as to threaten to
 cause them to be thrown into the river if they did not desist. The very
 women and children nowadays take upon them to lecture the oldest and most
 experienced men about the ecclesiastical laws; whereas the first of those
 of Plato forbids them to inquire so much as into the civil laws, which
 were to stand instead of divine ordinances; and, allowing the old men to
 confer amongst themselves or with the magistrate about those things, he
 adds, provided it be not in the presence of young or profane persons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A bishop has left in writing that at the other end of the world there is
 an isle, by the ancients called Dioscorides, abundantly fertile in all
 sorts of trees and fruits, and of an exceedingly healthful air; the
 inhabitants of which are Christians, having churches and altars, only
 adorned with crosses without any other images, great observers of fasts
 and feasts, exact payers of their tithes to the priests, and so chaste,
 that none of them is permitted to have to do with more than one woman in
 his life?[What Osorius says is that these people only had one wife
 at a time.]?as to the rest, so content with their condition, that
 environed with the sea they know nothing of navigation, and so simple that
 they understand not one syllable of the religion they profess and wherein
 they are so devout: a thing incredible to such as do not know that the
 Pagans, who are so zealous idolaters, know nothing more of their gods than
 their bare names and their statues. The ancient beginning of 'Menalippus',
 a tragedy of Euripides, ran thus:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "O Jupiter! for that name alone
 Of what thou art to me is known."
</pre>
 <p>
 I have also known in my time some men's writings found fault with for
 being purely human and philosophical, without any mixture of theology; and
 yet, with some show of reason, it might, on the contrary, be said that the
 divine doctrine, as queen and regent of the rest, better keeps her state
 apart, that she ought to be sovereign throughout, not subsidiary and
 suffragan, and that, peradventure, grammatical, rhetorical, logical
 examples may elsewhere be more suitably chosen, as also the material for
 the stage, games, and public entertainments, than from so sacred a matter;
 that divine reasons are considered with greater veneration and attention
 by themselves, and in their own proper style, than when mixed with and
 adapted to human discourse; that it is a fault much more often observed
 that the divines write too humanly, than that the humanists write not
 theologically enough. Philosophy, says St. Chrysostom, has long been
 banished the holy schools, as an handmaid altogether useless and thought
 unworthy to look, so much as in passing by the door, into the sanctuary of
 the holy treasures of the celestial doctrine; that the human way of
 speaking is of a much lower form and ought not to adopt for herself the
 dignity and majesty of divine eloquence. Let who will 'verbis
 indisciplinatis' talk of fortune, destiny, accident, good and evil hap,
 and other suchlike phrases, according to his own humour; I for my part
 propose fancies merely human and merely my own, and that simply as human
 fancies, and separately considered, not as determined by any decree from
 heaven, incapable of doubt or dispute; matter of opinion, not matter of
 faith; things which I discourse of according to my own notions, not as I
 believe, according to God; after a laical, not clerical, and yet always
 after a very religious manner, as children prepare their exercises, not to
 instruct but to be instructed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And might it not be said, that an edict enjoining all people but such as
 are public professors of divinity, to be very reserved in writing of
 religion, would carry with it a very good colour of utility and justice
 ?and to me, amongst the rest peradventure, to hold my prating? I
 have been told that even those who are not of our Church nevertheless
 amongst themselves expressly forbid the name of God to be used in common
 discourse, nor so much even by way of interjection, exclamation, assertion
 of a truth, or comparison; and I think them in the right: upon what
 occasion soever we call upon God to accompany and assist us, it ought
 always to be done with the greatest reverence and devotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There is, as I remember, a passage in Xenophon where he tells us that we
 ought so much the more seldom to call upon God, by how much it is hard to
 compose our souls to such a degree of calmness, patience, and devotion as
 it ought to be in at such a time; otherwise our prayers are not only vain
 and fruitless, but vicious: "forgive us," we say, "our trespasses, as we
 forgive them that trespass against us"; what do we mean by this petition
 but that we present to God a soul free from all rancour and revenge? And
 yet we make nothing of invoking God's assistance in our vices, and
 inviting Him into our unjust designs:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quae, nisi seductis, nequeas committere divis"

 ["Which you can only impart to the gods, when you have gained them
 over."?Persius, ii. 4.]
</pre>
 <p>
 the covetous man prays for the conservation of his vain and superfluous
 riches; the ambitious for victory and the good conduct of his fortune; the
 thief calls Him to his assistance, to deliver him from the dangers and
 difficulties that obstruct his wicked designs, or returns Him thanks for
 the facility he has met with in cutting a man's throat; at the door of the
 house men are going to storm or break into by force of a petard, they fall
 to prayers for success, their intentions and hopes of cruelty, avarice,
 and lust.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Hoc igitur, quo to Jovis aurem impellere tentas,
 Dic agedum Staio: 'proh Jupiter! O bone, clamet,
 Jupiter!' At sese non clamet Jupiter ipse."

 ["This therefore, with which you seek to draw the ear of Jupiter,
 say to Staius. 'O Jupiter! O good Jupiter!' let him cry. Think
 you Jupiter himself would not cry out upon it?"?Persius, ii. 21.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Marguerite, Queen of Navarre,?[In the Heptameron.]?tells of a
 young prince, who, though she does not name him, is easily enough by his
 great qualities to be known, who going upon an amorous assignation to lie
 with an advocate's wife of Paris, his way thither being through a church,
 he never passed that holy place going to or returning from his pious
 exercise, but he always kneeled down to pray. Wherein he would employ the
 divine favour, his soul being full of such virtuous meditations, I leave
 others to judge, which, nevertheless, she instances for a testimony of
 singular devotion. But this is not the only proof we have that women are
 not very fit to treat of theological affairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A true prayer and religious reconciling of ourselves to Almighty God
 cannot enter into an impure soul, subject at the very time to the dominion
 of Satan. He who calls God to his assistance whilst in a course of vice,
 does as if a cut-purse should call a magistrate to help him, or like those
 who introduce the name of God to the attestation of a lie.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tacito mala vota susurro
 Concipimus."

 ["We whisper our guilty prayers."?-Lucan, v. 104.]
</pre>
 <p>
 There are few men who durst publish to the world the prayers they make to
 Almighty God:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Haud cuivis promptum est, murmurque, humilesque susurros
 Tollere de templis, et aperto vivere voto"

 ["'Tis not convenient for every one to bring the prayers he mutters
 out of the temple, and to give his wishes to the public ear.
 ?"Persius, ii. 6.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and this is the reason why the Pythagoreans would have them always public
 and heard by every one, to the end they might not prefer indecent or
 unjust petitions as this man:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Clare quum dixit, Apollo!
 Labra movet, metuens audiri: Pulcra Laverna,
 Da mihi fallere, da justum sanctumque videri;
 Noctem peccatis, et fraudibus objice nubem."

 ["When he has clearly said Apollo! he moves his lips, fearful to be
 heard; he murmurs: O fair Laverna, grant me the talent to deceive;
 grant me to appear holy and just; shroud my sins with night, and
 cast a cloud over my frauds."?Horace, Ep., i. 16, 59.?(Laverna
 was the goddess of thieves.)]
</pre>
 <p>
 The gods severely punished the wicked prayers of OEdipus in granting them:
 he had prayed that his children might amongst themselves determine the
 succession to his throne by arms, and was so miserable as to see himself
 taken at his word. We are not to pray that all things may go as we would
 have them, but as most concurrent with prudence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We seem, in truth, to make use of our prayers as of a kind of jargon, and
 as those do who employ holy words about sorceries and magical operations;
 and as if we reckoned the benefit we are to reap from them as depending
 upon the contexture, sound, and jingle of words, or upon the grave
 composing of the countenance. For having the soul contaminated with
 concupiscence, not touched with repentance, or comforted by any late
 reconciliation with God, we go to present Him such words as the memory
 suggests to the tongue, and hope from thence to obtain the remission of
 our sins. There is nothing so easy, so sweet, and so favourable, as the
 divine law: it calls and invites us to her, guilty and abominable as we
 are; extends her arms and receives us into her bosom, foul and polluted as
 we at present are, and are for the future to be. But then, in return, we
 are to look upon her with a respectful eye; we are to receive this pardon
 with all gratitude and submission, and for that instant at least, wherein
 we address ourselves to her, to have the soul sensible of the ills we have
 committed, and at enmity with those passions that seduced us to offend
 her; neither the gods nor good men (says Plato) will accept the present of
 a wicked man:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Immunis aram si terigit manus,
 Non sumptuosa blandior hostia
 Mollivit aversos Penates
 Farre pio et saliente mica."

 ["If a pure hand has touched the altar, the pious offering of a
 small cake and a few grains of salt will appease the offended gods
 more effectually than costly sacrifices."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER LVII??OF AGE
 </h2>
 <p>
 I cannot allow of the way in which we settle for ourselves the duration of
 our life. I see that the sages contract it very much in comparison of the
 common opinion: "what," said the younger Cato to those who would stay his
 hand from killing himself, "am I now of an age to be reproached that I go
 out of the world too soon?" And yet he was but eight-and-forty years old.
 He thought that to be a mature and advanced age, considering how few
 arrive unto it. And such as, soothing their thoughts with I know not what
 course of nature, promise to themselves some years beyond it, could they
 be privileged from the infinite number of accidents to which we are by a
 natural subjection exposed, they might have some reason so to do. What am
 idle conceit is it to expect to die of a decay of strength, which is the
 effect of extremest age, and to propose to ourselves no shorter lease of
 life than that, considering it is a kind of death of all others the most
 rare and very seldom seen? We call that only a natural death; as if it
 were contrary to nature to see a man break his neck with a fall, be
 drowned in shipwreck, be snatched away with a pleurisy or the plague, and
 as if our ordinary condition did not expose us to these inconveniences.
 Let us no longer flatter ourselves with these fine words; we ought rather,
 peradventure, to call that natural which is general, common, and
 universal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To die of old age is a death rare, extraordinary, and singular, and,
 therefore, so much less natural than the others; 'tis the last and
 extremest sort of dying: and the more remote, the less to be hoped for. It
 is, indeed, the bourn beyond which we are not to pass, and which the law
 of nature has set as a limit, not to be exceeded; but it is, withal, a
 privilege she is rarely seen to give us to last till then. 'Tis a lease
 she only signs by particular favour, and it may be to one only in the
 space of two or three ages, and then with a pass to boot, to carry him
 through all the traverses and difficulties she has strewed in the way of
 this long career. And therefore my opinion is, that when once forty years
 we should consider it as an age to which very few arrive. For seeing that
 men do not usually proceed so far, it is a sign that we are pretty well
 advanced; and since we have exceeded the ordinary bounds, which is the
 just measure of life, we ought not to expect to go much further; having
 escaped so many precipices of death, whereinto we have seen so many other
 men fall, we should acknowledge that so extraordinary a fortune as that
 which has hitherto rescued us from those eminent perils, and kept us alive
 beyond the ordinary term of living, is not like to continue long.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis a fault in our very laws to maintain this error: these say that a man
 is not capable of managing his own estate till he be five-and-twenty years
 old, whereas he will have much ado to manage his life so long. Augustus
 cut off five years from the ancient Roman standard, and declared that
 thirty years old was sufficient for a judge. Servius Tullius superseded
 the knights of above seven-and-forty years of age from the fatigues of
 war; Augustus dismissed them at forty-five; though methinks it seems a
 little unreasonable that men should be sent to the fireside till
 five-and-fifty or sixty years of age. I should be of opinion that our
 vocation and employment should be as far as possible extended for the
 public good: I find the fault on the other side, that they do not employ
 us early enough. This emperor was arbiter of the whole world at nineteen,
 and yet would have a man to be thirty before he could be fit to determine
 a dispute about a gutter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For my part, I believe our souls are adult at twenty as much as they are
 ever like to be, and as capable then as ever. A soul that has not by that
 time given evident earnest of its force and virtue will never after come
 to proof. The natural qualities and virtues produce what they have of
 vigorous and fine, within that term or never,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si l'espine rion picque quand nai,
 A pene que picque jamai,"

 ["If the thorn does not prick at its birth,
 'twill hardly ever prick at all."]
</pre>
 <p>
 as they say in Dauphin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of all the great human actions I ever heard or read of, of what sort
 soever, I have observed, both in former ages and our own, more were
 performed before the age of thirty than after; and this ofttimes in the
 very lives of the same men. May I not confidently instance in those of
 Hannibal and his great rival Scipio? The better half of their lives they
 lived upon the glory they had acquired in their youth; great men after,
 'tis true, in comparison of others; but by no means in comparison of
 themselves. As to my own particular, I do certainly believe that since
 that age, both my understanding and my constitution have rather decayed
 than improved, and retired rather than advanced. 'Tis possible, that with
 those who make the best use of their time, knowledge and experience may
 increase with their years; but vivacity, promptitude, steadiness, and
 other pieces of us, of much greater importance, and much more essentially
 our own, languish and decay:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ubi jam validis quassatum est viribus aevi
 Corpus, et obtusis ceciderunt viribus artus,
 Claudicat ingenium, delirat linguaque, mensque."

 ["When once the body is shaken by the violence of time,
 blood and vigour ebbing away, the judgment halts,
 the tongue and the mind dote."?Lucretius, iii. 452.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Sometimes the body first submits to age, sometimes the mind; and I have
 seen enough who have got a weakness in their brains before either in their
 legs or stomach; and by how much the more it is a disease of no great pain
 to the sufferer, and of obscure symptoms, so much greater is the danger.
 For this reason it is that I complain of our laws, not that they keep us
 too long to our work, but that they set us to work too late. For the
 frailty of life considered, and to how many ordinary and natural rocks it
 is exposed, one ought not to give up so large a portion of it to
 childhood, idleness, and apprenticeship.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [Which Cotton thus renders: "Birth though noble, ought not to share
 so large a vacancy, and so tedious a course of education." Florio
 (1613) makes the passage read as-follows: "Methinks that,
 considering the weakness of our life, and seeing the infinite number
 of ordinary rocks and natural dangers it is subject unto, we should
 not, so soon as we come into the world, allot so large a share
 thereof unto unprofitable wantonness in youth, ill-breeding
 idleness, and slow-learning prentisage."]

 <h2>
 CHAPTER I??OF THE INCONSTANCY OF OUR ACTIONS
 </h2>
 <p>
 Such as make it their business to oversee human actions, do not find
 themselves in anything so much perplexed as to reconcile them and bring
 them into the world's eye with the same lustre and reputation; for they
 commonly so strangely contradict one another that it seems impossible they
 should proceed from one and the same person. We find the younger Marius
 one while a son of Mars and another a son of Venus. Pope Boniface VIII.
 entered, it is said, into his Papacy like a fox, behaved himself in it
 like a lion, and died like a dog; and who could believe it to be the same
 Nero, the perfect image of all cruelty, who, having the sentence of a
 condemned man brought to him to sign, as was the custom, cried out, "O
 that I had never been taught to write!" so much it went to his heart to
 condemn a man to death. All story is full of such examples, and every man
 is able to produce so many to himself, or out of his own practice or
 observation, that I sometimes wonder to see men of understanding give
 themselves the trouble of sorting these pieces, considering that
 irresolution appears to me to be the most common and manifest vice of our
 nature witness the famous verse of the player Publius:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Malum consilium est, quod mutari non potest."

 ["'Tis evil counsel that will admit no change."
 ?Pub. Mim., ex Aul. Gell., xvii. 14.]
</pre>
 <p>
 There seems some reason in forming a judgment of a man from the most usual
 methods of his life; but, considering the natural instability of our
 manners and opinions, I have often thought even the best authors a little
 out in so obstinately endeavouring to make of us any constant and solid
 contexture; they choose a general air of a man, and according to that
 interpret all his actions, of which, if they cannot bend some to a
 uniformity with the rest, they are presently imputed to dissimulation.
 Augustus has escaped them, for there was in him so apparent, sudden, and
 continual variety of actions all the whole course of his life, that he has
 slipped away clear and undecided from the most daring critics. I can more
 hardly believe a man's constancy than any other virtue, and believe
 nothing sooner than the contrary. He that would judge of a man in detail
 and distinctly, bit by bit, would oftener be able to speak the truth. It
 is a hard matter, from all antiquity, to pick out a dozen men who have
 formed their lives to one certain and constant course, which is the
 principal design of wisdom; for to comprise it all in one word, says one
 of the ancients, and to contract all the rules of human life into one, "it
 is to will, and not to will, always one and the same thing: I will not
 vouchsafe," says he, "to add, provided the will be just, for if it be not
 just, it is impossible it should be always one." I have indeed formerly
 learned that vice is nothing but irregularity, and want of measure, and
 therefore 'tis impossible to fix constancy to it. 'Tis a saying of.
 Demosthenes, "that the beginning oh all virtue is consultation and
 deliberation; the end and perfection, constancy." If we would resolve on
 any certain course by reason, we should pitch upon the best, but nobody
 has thought on't:

 <p>
 Our ordinary practice is to follow the inclinations of our appetite, be it
 to the left or right, upwards or downwards, according as we are wafted by
 the breath of occasion. We never meditate what we would have till the
 instant we have a mind to have it; and change like that little creature
 which receives its colour from what it is laid upon. What we but just now
 proposed to ourselves we immediately alter, and presently return again to
 it; 'tis nothing but shifting and inconsistency:

<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ducimur, ut nervis alienis mobile lignum."

 We do not go, we are driven; like things that float, now leisurely, then
 with violence, according to the gentleness or rapidity of the current:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nonne videmus,
 Quid sibi quisque velit, nescire, et quaerere semper
 Commutare locum, quasi onus deponere possit?"

 for something new, as if they could get rid of the burthen."

 Juppiter auctificas lustravit lumine terras."

 ["Such are the minds of men, that they change as the light with

 ?Cicero, Frag. Poet, lib. x.]
</pre>
 <p>
 We fluctuate betwixt various inclinations; we will nothing freely, nothing
 absolutely, nothing constantly. In any one who had prescribed and
 established determinate laws and rules in his head for his own conduct, we
 should perceive an equality of manners, an order and an infallible
 relation of one thing or action to another, shine through his whole life;
 Empedocles observed this discrepancy in the Agrigentines, that they gave
 themselves up to delights, as if every day was their last, and built as if
 they had been to live for ever. The judgment would not be hard to make, as
 is very evident in the younger Cato; he who therein has found one step, it
 will lead him to all the rest; 'tis a harmony of very according sounds,
 that cannot jar. But with us 't is quite contrary; every particular action
 requires a particular judgment. The surest way to steer, in my opinion,
 would be to take our measures from the nearest allied circumstances,
 without engaging in a longer inquisition, or without concluding any other
 consequence. I was told, during the civil disorders of our poor kingdom,
 that a maid, hard by the place where I then was, had thrown herself out of
 a window to avoid being forced by a common soldier who was quartered in
 the house; she was not killed by the fall, and therefore, repeating her
 attempt would have cut her own throat, had she not been prevented; but
 having, nevertheless, wounded herself to some show of danger, she
 voluntarily confessed that the soldier had not as yet importuned her
 otherwise; than by courtship, earnest solicitation, and presents; but that
 she was afraid that in the end he would have proceeded to violence, all
 which she delivered with such a countenance and accent, and withal embrued
 in her own blood, the highest testimony of her virtue, that she appeared
 another Lucretia; and yet I have since been very well assured that both
 before and after she was not so difficult a piece. And, according to my
 host's tale in Ariosto, be as handsome a man and as worthy a gentleman as
 you will, do not conclude too much upon your mistress's inviolable
 chastity for having been repulsed; you do not know but she may have a
 better stomach to your muleteer.

 Antigonus, having taken one of his soldiers into a great degree of favour
 and esteem for his valour, gave his physicians strict charge to cure him
 of a long and inward disease under which he had a great while languished,
 and observing that, after his cure, he went much more coldly to work than
 before, he asked him what had so altered and cowed him: "Yourself, sir,"
 replied the other, "by having eased me of the pains that made me weary of
 my life." Lucullus's soldier having been rifled by the enemy, performed
 upon them in revenge a brave exploit, by which having made himself a
 gainer, Lucullus, who had conceived a good opinion of him from that
 action, went about to engage him in some enterprise of very great danger,
 with all the plausible persuasions and promises he could think of;
 </p><br>

 ["Some poor fellow, who has lost his purse, will go whither you

</pre>
 <p>
 and flatly refused to go. When we read that Mahomet having furiously rated
 Chasan, Bassa of the Janissaries, because he had seen the Hungarians break
 into his squadrons, and himself behave very ill in the business, and that
 Chasan, instead of any other answer, rushed furiously alone, scimitar in
 hand, into the first body of the enemy, where he was presently cut to
 pieces, we are not to look upon that action, peradventure, so much as
 vindication as a turn of mind, not so much natural valour as a sudden
 despite. The man you saw yesterday so adventurous and brave, you must not
 think it strange to see him as great a poltroon the next: anger,
 necessity, company, wine, or the sound of the trumpet had roused his
 spirits; this is no valour formed and established by reason, but
 accidentally created by such circumstances, and therefore it is no wonder
 if by contrary circumstances it appear quite another thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These supple variations and contradictions so manifest in us, have given
 occasion to some to believe that man has two souls; other two distinct
 powers that always accompany and incline us, the one towards good and the
 other towards ill, according to their own nature and propension; so abrupt
 a variety not being imaginable to flow from one and the same source.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For my part, the puff of every accident not only carries me along with it
 according to its own proclivity, but moreover I discompose and trouble
 myself by the instability of my own posture; and whoever will look
 narrowly into his own bosom, will hardly find himself twice in the same
 condition. I give to my soul sometimes one face and sometimes another,
 according to the side I turn her to. If I speak variously of myself, it is
 because I consider myself variously; all the contrarieties are there to be
 found in one corner or another; after one fashion or another: bashful,
 insolent; chaste, lustful; prating, silent; laborious, delicate;
 ingenious, heavy; melancholic, pleasant; lying, true; knowing, ignorant;
 liberal, covetous, and prodigal: I find all this in myself, more or less,
 according as I turn myself about; and whoever will sift himself to the
 bottom, will find in himself, and even in his own judgment, this
 volubility and discordance. I have nothing to say of myself entirely,
 simply, and solidly without mixture and confusion. 'Distinguo' is the most
 universal member of my logic. Though I always intend to speak well of good
 things, and rather to interpret such things as fall out in the best sense
 than otherwise, yet such is the strangeness of our condition, that we are
 often pushed on to do well even by vice itself, if well-doing were not
 judged by the intention only. One gallant action, therefore, ought not to
 conclude a man valiant; if a man were brave indeed, he would be always so,
 and upon all occasions. If it were a habit of valour and not a sally, it
 would render a man equally resolute in all accidents; the same alone as in
 company; the same in lists as in a battle: for, let them say what they
 will, there is not one valour for the pavement and another for the field;
 he would bear a sickness in his bed as bravely as a wound in the field,
 and no more fear death in his own house than at an assault. We should not
 then see the same man charge into a breach with a brave assurance, and
 afterwards torment himself like a woman for the loss of a trial at law or
 the death of a child; when, being an infamous coward, he is firm in the
 necessities of poverty; when he shrinks at the sight of a barber's razor,
 and rushes fearless upon the swords of the enemy, the action is
 commendable, not the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Many of the Greeks, says Cicero,?[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 27.]?
 cannot endure the sight of an enemy, and yet are courageous in sickness;
 the Cimbrians and Celtiberians quite contrary;

<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nihil enim potest esse aequabile,

 ["Nothing can be regular that does not proceed from a fixed ground

</pre>
 <p>
 No valour can be more extreme in its kind than that of Alexander: but it
 is of but one kind, nor full enough throughout, nor universal.
 Incomparable as it is, it has yet some blemishes; of which his being so
 often at his wits' end upon every light suspicion of his captains
 conspiring against his life, and the carrying himself in that inquisition
 with so much vehemence and indiscreet injustice, and with a fear that
 subverted his natural reason, is one pregnant instance. The superstition,
 also, with which he was so much tainted, carries along with it some image
 of pusillanimity; and the excess of his penitence for the murder of Clytus
 is also a testimony of the unevenness of his courage. All we perform is no
 other than a cento, as a man may say, of several pieces, and we would
 acquire honour by a false title. Virtue cannot be followed but for
 herself, and if one sometimes borrows her mask to some other purpose, she
 presently pulls it away again. 'Tis a vivid and strong tincture which,
 when the soul has once thoroughly imbibed it, will not out but with the
 piece. And, therefore, to make a right judgment of a man, we are long and
 very observingly to follow his trace: if constancy does not there stand
 firm upon her own proper base,

 if the variety of occurrences makes him alter his pace (his path, I mean,
 for the pace may be faster or slower) let him go; such an one runs before

 <p>
 'Tis no wonder, says one of the ancients, that chance has so great a
 dominion over us, since it is by chance we live. It is not possible for
 any one who has not designed his life for some certain end, it is
 impossible for any one to arrange the pieces, who has not the whole form
 already contrived in his imagination. Of what use are colours to him that
 knows not what he is to paint? No one lays down a certain design for his
 life, and we only deliberate thereof by pieces. The archer ought first to
 know at what he is to aim, and then accommodate his arm, bow, string,
 shaft, and motion to it; our counsels deviate and wander, because not
 levelled to any determinate end. No wind serves him who addresses his
 voyage to no certain, port. I cannot acquiesce in the judgment given by
 one in the behalf of Sophocles, who concluded him capable of the
 management of domestic affairs, against the accusation of his son, from
 having read one of his tragedies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Neither do I allow of the conjecture of the Parians, sent to regulate the
 Milesians sufficient for such a consequence as they from thence derived
 coming to visit the island, they took notice of such grounds as were best
 husbanded, and such country-houses as were best governed; and having taken
 the names of the owners, when they had assembled the citizens, they
 appointed these farmers for new governors and magistrates; concluding that
 they, who had been so provident in their own private concerns, would be so
 of the public too. We are all lumps, and of so various and inform a
 contexture, that every piece plays, every moment, its own game, and there
 is as much difference betwixt us and ourselves as betwixt us and others:

 Since ambition can teach man valour, temperance, and liberality, and even
 justice too; seeing that avarice can inspire the courage of a shop-boy,
 bred and nursed up in obscurity and ease, with the assurance to expose
 himself so far from the fireside to the mercy of the waves and angry
 Neptune in a frail boat; that she further teaches discretion and prudence;
 and that even Venus can inflate boys under the discipline of the rod with
 boldness and resolution, and infuse masculine courage into the heart of
 tender virgins in their mothers' arms:

 CHAPTER II??OF DRUNKENNESS
 </h2>
 <p>
 The world is nothing but variety and disemblance, vices are all alike, as
 they are vices, and peradventure the Stoics understand them so; but
 although they are equally vices, yet they are not all equal vices; and he
 who has transgressed the ordinary bounds a hundred paces:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum,"

 ["Beyond or within which the right cannot exist."
 ?Horace, Sat., i, 1, 107.]
</pre>
 <p>
 should not be in a worse condition than he that has advanced but ten, is
 not to be believed; or that sacrilege is not worse than stealing a
 cabbage:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nec vincet ratio hoc, tantumdem ut peccet, idemque,
 Qui teneros caules alieni fregerit horti,
 Et qui nocturnus divum sacra legerit."
</pre>
 <p>
 There is in this as great diversity as in anything whatever. The
 confounding of the order and measure of sins is dangerous: murderers,
 traitors, and tyrants get too much by it, and it is not reasonable they
 should flatter their consciences, because another man is idle, lascivious,
 or not assiduous at his devotion. Every one overrates the offence of his
 companions, but extenuates his own. Our very instructors themselves rank
 them sometimes, in my opinion, very ill. As Socrates said that the
 principal office of wisdom was to distinguish good from evil, we, the best
 of whom are vicious, ought also to say the same of the science of
 distinguishing betwixt vice and vice, without which, and that very exactly
 performed, the virtuous and the wicked will remain confounded and
 unrecognised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, amongst the rest, drunkenness seems to me to be a gross and brutish
 vice. The soul has greater part in the rest, and there are some vices that
 have something, if a man may so say, of generous in them; there are vices
 wherein there is a mixture of knowledge, diligence, valour, prudence,
 dexterity, and address; this one is totally corporeal and earthly. And the
 rudest nation this day in Europe is that alone where it is in fashion.
 Other vices discompose the understanding: this totally overthrows it and
 renders the body stupid:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Cum vini vis penetravit . . .
 Consequitur gravitas membrorum, praepediuntur
 Crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens,
 Nant oculi; clamor, singultus, jurgia, gliscunt."

 ["When the power of wine has penetrated us, a heaviness of the limbs
 follows, the legs of the tottering person are impeded; the tongue
 grows torpid, the mind is dimmed, the eyes swim; noise, hiccup, and
 quarrels arise.?"Lucretius, i. 3, 475.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The worst state of man is that wherein he loses the knowledge and
 government of himself. And 'tis said amongst other things upon this
 subject, that, as the must fermenting in a vessel, works up to the top
 whatever it has in the bottom, so wine, in those who have drunk beyond
 measure, vents the most inward secrets:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Tu sapientum
 Curas et arcanum jocoso
 Consilium retegis Lyaeo."

 ["Thou disclosest to the merry Lyacus the cares and secret
 counsel of the wise."?Horace, Od., xxi. 1, 114.]

 [Lyacus, a name given to Bacchus.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Josephus tells us that by giving an ambassador the enemy had sent to him
 his full dose of liquor, he wormed out his secrets. And yet, Augustus,
 committing the most inward secrets of his affairs to Lucius Piso, who
 conquered Thrace, never found him faulty in the least, no more than
 Tiberias did Cossus, with whom he intrusted his whole counsels, though we
 know they were both so given to drink that they have often been fain to
 carry both the one and the other drunk out of the Senate:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Hesterno inflatum venas ut semper, Lyaeo."

 ["Their veins full, as usual, of yesterday's wine."
 ?Virgil, Egl., vi. 15.]

 <p>
 And the design of killing Caesar was as safely communicated to Cimber,
 though he would often be drunk, as to Cassius, who drank nothing but
 water.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> [As to which Cassius pleasantly said: "What, shall I bear
 a tyrant, I who cannot bear wine?"]
</pre>
 <p>
 We see our Germans, when drunk as the devil, know their post, remember the
 word, and keep to their ranks:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nec facilis victoria de madidis, et
 Blaesis, atque mero titubantibus."

 ["Nor is a victory easily obtained over men so drunk, they can
 scarce speak or stand."?Juvenal, Sat., xv. 47.]
</pre>
 <p>
 I could not have believed there had been so profound, senseless, and dead
 a degree of drunkenness had I not read in history that Attalus having, to
 put a notable affront upon him, invited to supper the same Pausanias, who
 upon the very same occasion afterwards killed Philip of Macedon, a king
 who by his excellent qualities gave sufficient testimony of his education
 in the house and company of Epaminondas, made him drink to such a pitch
 that he could after abandon his beauty, as of a hedge strumpet, to the
 muleteers and servants of the basest office in the house. And I have been
 further told by a lady whom I highly honour and esteem, that near Bordeaux
 and about Castres where she lives, a country woman, a widow of chaste
 repute, perceiving in herself the first symptoms of breeding, innocently
 told her neighbours that if she had a husband she should think herself
 with child; but the causes of suspicion every day more and more
 increasing, and at last growing up to a manifest proof, the poor woman was
 reduced to the necessity of causing it to be proclaimed in her parish
 church, that whoever had done that deed and would frankly confess it, she
 did not only promise to forgive, but moreover to marry him, if he liked
 the motion; whereupon a young fellow that served her in the quality of a
 labourer, encouraged by this proclamation, declared that he had one
 holiday found her, having taken too much of the bottle, so fast asleep by
 the chimney and in so indecent a posture, that he could conveniently do
 his business without waking her; and they yet live together man and wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is true that antiquity has not much decried this vice; the writings
 even of several philosophers speak very tenderly of it, and even amongst
 the Stoics there are some who advise folks to give themselves sometimes
 the liberty to drink, nay, to drunkenness, to refresh the soul:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Hoc quoque virtutum quondam certamine, magnum
 Socratem palmam promeruisse ferunt."

 ["In this trial of power formerly they relate that the great
 Socrates deserved the palm."?Cornet. Gallus, Ep., i. 47.]
</pre>
 <p>
 That censor and reprover of others, Cato, was reproached that he was a
 hard drinker:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Narratur et prisci Catonis
 Saepe mero caluisse virtus."

 ["And of old Cato it is said, that his courage was often warmed with
 wine."?Horace, Od., xxi. 3, 11.?Cato the Elder.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Cyrus, that so renowned king, amongst the other qualities by which he
 claimed to be preferred before his brother Artaxerxes, urged this
 excellence, that he could drink a great deal more than he. And in the best
 governed nations this trial of skill in drinking is very much in use. I
 have heard Silvius, an excellent physician of Paris, say that lest the
 digestive faculties of the stomach should grow idle, it were not amiss
 once a month to rouse them by this excess, and to spur them lest they
 should grow dull and rusty; and one author tells us that the Persians used
 to consult about their most important affairs after being well warmed with
 wine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My taste and constitution are greater enemies to this vice than my
 discourse; for besides that I easily submit my belief to the authority of
 ancient opinions, I look upon it indeed as an unmanly and stupid vice, but
 less malicious and hurtful than the others, which, almost all, more
 directly jostle public society. And if we cannot please ourselves but it
 must cost us something, as they hold, I find this vice costs a man's
 conscience less than the others, besides that it is of no difficult
 preparation, nor hard to be found, a consideration not altogether to be
 despised. A man well advanced both in dignity and age, amongst three
 principal commodities that he said remained to him of life, reckoned to me
 this for one, and where would a man more justly find it than amongst the
 natural conveniences? But he did not take it right, for delicacy and the
 curious choice of wines is therein to be avoided. If you found your
 pleasure upon drinking of the best, you condemn yourself to the penance of
 drinking of the worst. Your taste must be more indifferent and free; so
 delicate a palate is not required to make a good toper. The Germans drink
 almost indifferently of all wines with delight; their business is to pour
 down and not to taste; and it's so much the better for them: their
 pleasure is so much the more plentiful and nearer at hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Secondly, to drink, after the French fashion, but at two meals, and then
 very moderately, is to be too sparing of the favours of the god. There is
 more time and constancy required than so. The ancients spent whole nights
 in this exercise, and ofttimes added the day following to eke it out, and
 therefore we are to take greater liberty and stick closer to our work. I
 have seen a great lord of my time, a man of high enterprise and famous
 success, that without setting himself to't, and after his ordinary rate of
 drinking at meals, drank not much less than five quarts of wine, and at
 his going away appeared but too wise and discreet, to the detriment of our
 affairs. The pleasure we hold in esteem for the course of our lives ought
 to have a greater share of our time dedicated to it; we should, like
 shopboys and labourers, refuse no occasion nor omit any opportunity of
 drinking, and always have it in our minds. Methinks we every day abridge
 and curtail the use of wine, and that the after breakfasts, dinner
 snatches, and collations I used to see in my father's house, when I was a
 boy, were more usual and frequent then than now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Is it that we pretend to a reformation? Truly, no: but it may be we are
 more addicted to Venus than our fathers were. They are two exercises that
 thwart and hinder one another in their vigour. Lechery weakens our stomach
 on the one side; and on the other sobriety renders us more spruce and
 amorous for the exercise of love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis wonderful what strange stories I have heard my father tell of the
 chastity of that age wherein he lived. It was for him to say it, being
 both by art and nature cut out and finished for the service of ladies. He
 spoke well and little: ever mixing his language with some illustration out
 of authors most in use, especially in Spanish, and among the Spanish he
 whom they called Marcus Aurelius?[ Guevara's Golden Book of Marcus
 Aurelius Antoninus.]?was ordinarily in his mouth. His behaviour was
 gently grave, humble, and very modest; he was very solicitous of neatness
 and propriety both in his person and clothes, whether on horseback or
 afoot, he was monstrously punctual in his word; and of a conscience and
 religion generally tending rather towards superstition than otherwise. For
 a man of little stature, very strong, well proportioned, and well knit; of
 a pleasing countenance inclining to brown, and very adroit in all noble
 exercises. I have yet in the house to be seen canes poured full of lead,
 with which they say he exercised his arms for throwing the bar or the
 stone, or in fencing; and shoes with leaden soles to make him lighter for
 running or leaping. Of his vaulting he has left little miracles behind
 him: I have seen him when past three score laugh at our exercises, and
 throw himself in his furred gown into the saddle, make the tour of a table
 upon his thumbs and scarce ever mount the stairs into his chamber without
 taking three or four steps at a time. But as to what I was speaking of
 before; he said there was scarce one woman of quality of ill fame in the
 whole province: he would tell of strange confidences, and some of them his
 own, with virtuous women, free from any manner of suspicion of ill, and
 for his own part solemnly swore he was a virgin at his marriage; and yet
 it was after a long practice of arms beyond the mountains, of which wars
 he left us a journal under his own hand, wherein he has given a precise
 account from point to point of all passages, both relating to the public
 and to himself. And he was, moreover, married at a well advanced maturity,
 in the year 1528, the three-and-thirtieth year of his age, upon his way
 home from Italy. But let us return to our bottles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The incommodities of old age, that stand in need of some refreshment and
 support, might with reason beget in me a desire of this faculty, it being
 as it were the last pleasure the course of years deprives us of. The
 natural heat, say the good-fellows, first seats itself in the feet: that
 concerns infancy; thence it mounts into the middle region, where it makes
 a long abode and produces, in my opinion, the sole true pleasures of human
 life; all other pleasures in comparison sleep; towards the end, like a
 vapour that still mounts upward, it arrives at the throat, where it makes
 its final residence, and concludes the progress. I do not, nevertheless,
 understand how a man can extend the pleasure of drinking beyond thirst,
 and forge in his imagination an appetite artificial and against nature; my
 stomach would not proceed so far; it has enough to do to deal with what it
 takes in for its necessity. My constitution is not to care for drink but
 as following eating and washing down my meat, and for that reason my last
 draught is always the greatest. And seeing that in old age we have our
 palate furred with phlegms or depraved by some other ill constitution, the
 wine tastes better to us as the pores are cleaner washed and laid more
 open. At least, I seldom taste the first glass well. Anacharsis wondered
 that the Greeks drank in greater glasses towards the end of a meal than at
 the beginning; which was, I suppose, for the same reason the Germans do
 the same, who then begin the battle of drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plato forbids children wine till eighteen years of age, and to get drunk
 till forty; but, after forty, gives them leave to please themselves, and
 to mix a little liberally in their feasts the influence of Dionysos, that
 good deity who restores to younger men their gaiety and to old men their
 youth; who mollifies the passions of the soul, as iron is softened by
 fire; and in his Lazes allows such merry meetings, provided they have a
 discreet chief to govern and keep them in order, as good and of great
 utility; drunkenness being, he says, a true and certain trial of every
 one's nature, and, withal, fit to inspire old men with mettle to divert
 themselves in dancing and music; things of great use, and that they dare
 not attempt when sober. He, moreover, says that wine is able to supply the
 soul with temperance and the body with health. Nevertheless, these
 restrictions, in part borrowed from the Carthaginians, please him: that
 men forbear excesses in the expeditions of war; that every judge and
 magistrate abstain from it when about the administrations of his place or
 the consultations of the public affairs; that the day is not to be
 employed with it, that being a time due to other occupations, nor the
 night on which a man intends to get children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tis said that the philosopher Stilpo, when oppressed with age, purposely
 hastened his end by drinking pure wine. The same thing, but not designed
 by him, despatched also the philosopher Arcesilaus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But 'tis an old and pleasant question, whether the soul of a wise man can
 be overcome by the strength of wine?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si munitae adhibet vim sapientiae."

 <p>
 To what vanity does the good opinion we have of ourselves push us? The
 most regular and most perfect soul in the world has but too much to do to
 keep itself upright, and from being overthrown by its own weakness. There
 is not one of a thousand that is right and settled so much as one minute
 in a whole life, and that may not very well doubt, whether according to
 her natural condition she ever can be; but to join constancy to it is her
 utmost perfection; I mean when nothing should jostle and discompose her,
 which a thousand accidents may do. 'Tis to much purpose that the great
 poet Lucretius keeps such a clatter with his philosophy, when, behold! he
 goes mad with a love philtre. Is it to be imagined that an apoplexy will
 not stun Socrates as well as a porter? Some men have forgotten their own
 names by the violence of a disease; and a slight wound has turned the
 judgment of others topsy-turvy. Let him be as wise as he will, after all
 he is but a man; and than that what is there more frail, more miserable,
 or more nothing? Wisdom does not force our natural dispositions,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sudores itaque, et pallorem exsistere toto
 Corpore, et infringi linguam, vocemque aboriri,
 Caligare oculos, sonere aures, succidere artus,

 ["Sweat and paleness come over the whole body, the tongue is
 rendered powerless, the voice dies away, the eyes are darkened,
 there is ringing in the ears, the limbs sink under us by the
 influence of fear."?Lucretius, iii. 155.]
</pre>
 <p>
 he must shut his eyes against the blow that threatens him; he must tremble
 upon the margin of a precipice, like a child; nature having reserved these
 light marks of her authority, not to be forced by our reason and the stoic
 virtue, to teach man his mortality and our weakness; he turns pale with
 fear, red with shame, and groans with the cholic, if not with desperate
 outcry, at least with hoarse and broken voice:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Humani a se nihil alienum putet."

 ["Let him not think himself exempt from that which is incidental to
 men in general."?Terence, Heauton, i. 1, 25.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The poets, that feign all things at pleasure, dare not acquit their
 greatest heroes of tears:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sic fatur lacrymans, classique immittit habenas."

 ["Thus he speaks, weeping, and then sets sail with his fleet."
 ?Aeneid, vi. i.]
</pre>
 <p>
 'Tis sufficient for a man to curb and moderate his inclinations, for
 totally to suppress them is not in him to do. Even our great Plutarch,
 that excellent and perfect judge of human actions, when he sees Brutus and
 Torquatus kill their children, begins to doubt whether virtue could
 proceed so far, and to question whether these persons had not rather been
 stimulated by some other passion.?[Plutarch, Life of Publicola, c.
 3.] ?All actions exceeding the ordinary bounds are liable to
 sinister interpretation, for as much as our liking no more holds with what
 is above than with what is below it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let us leave that other sect, that sets up an express profession of
 scornful superiority?[The Stoics.]?: but when even in that
 sect, reputed the most quiet and gentle, we hear these rhodomontades of
 Metrodorus:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Occupavi te, Fortuna, atque cepi: omnesque aditus tuos
 interclusi ut ad me aspirare non posses;"

 ["Fortune, I have got the better of thee, and have made all the
 avenues so sure thou canst not come at me."
 ?Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 9.]
</pre>
 <p>
 when Anaxarchus, by command of Nicocreon the tyrant of Cyprus, was put
 into a stone mortar, and laid upon with mauls of iron, ceases not to say,
 "Strike, batter, break; 'tis not Anaxarchus, 'tis but his sheath that you
 pound and bray so"; when we hear our martyrs cry out to the tyrant from
 the middle of the flame, "This side is roasted enough, fall to and eat, it
 is enough done; fall to work with the other;" when we hear the child in
 Josephus' torn piece-meal with pincers, defying Antiochus, and crying out
 with a constant and assured voice: "Tyrant, thou losest thy labour, I am
 still at ease; where is the pain, where are the torments with which thou
 didst so threaten me? Is this all thou canst do? My constancy torments
 thee more than thy cruelty does me. O pitiful coward, thou faintest, and I
 grow stronger; make me complain, make me bend, make me yield if thou
 canst; encourage thy guards, cheer up thy executioners; see, see they
 faint, and can do no more; arm them, flesh them anew, spur them up";
 truly, a man must confess that there is some phrenzy, some fury, how holy
 soever, that at that time possesses those souls. When we come to these
 Stoical sallies: "I had rather be mad than voluptuous," a saying of
 Antisthenes. When Sextius tells us, "he had rather be fettered with
 affliction than pleasure": when Epicurus takes upon him to play with his
 gout, and, refusing health and ease, defies all torments, and despising
 the lesser pains, as disdaining to contend with them, he covets and calls
 out for others sharper, more violent, and more worthy of him;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Spumantemque dari, pecora inter inertia, votis
 Optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem:"

 ["And instead of timid beasts, wishes the foaming boar or tawny lion
 would come from the mountain."?AEneid, iv. 158.]
</pre>
 <p>
 who but must conclude that these are wild sallies pushed on by a courage
 that has broken loose from its place? Our soul cannot from her own seat
 reach so high; 'tis necessary she must leave it, raise herself up, and,
 taking the bridle in her teeth, transport her man so far that he shall
 afterwards himself be astonished at what he has done; as, in war, the heat
 of battle impels generous soldiers to perform things of so infinite
 danger, as afterwards, recollecting them, they themselves are the first to
 wonder at; as it also fares with the poets, who are often rapt with
 admiration of their own writings, and know not where again to find the
 track through which they performed so fine a Career; which also is in them
 called fury and rapture. And as Plato says, 'tis to no purpose for a
 sober-minded man to knock at the door of poesy: so Aristotle says, that no
 excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness; and he has reason to
 call all transports, how commendable soever, that surpass our own judgment
 and understanding, madness; forasmuch as wisdom is a regular government of
 the soul, which is carried on with measure and proportion, and for which
 she is to herself responsible. Plato argues thus, that the faculty of
 prophesying is so far above us, that we must be out of ourselves when we
 meddle with it, and our prudence must either be obstructed by sleep or
 sickness, or lifted from her place by some celestial rapture.

 <p>
 If to philosophise be, as 'tis defined, to doubt, much more to write at
 random and play the fool, as I do, ought to be reputed doubting, for it is
 for novices and freshmen to inquire and to dispute, and for the chairman
 to moderate and determine.

 My moderator is the authority of the divine will, that governs us without
 contradiction, and that is seated above these human and vain
 contestations.

 <p>
 Philip having forcibly entered into Peloponnesus, and some one saying to
 Damidas that the Lacedaemonians were likely very much to suffer if they
 did not in time reconcile themselves to his favour: "Why, you pitiful
 fellow," replied he, "what can they suffer who do not fear to die?" It
 being also asked of Agis, which way a man might live free? "Why," said he,
 "by despising death." These, and a thousand other sayings to the same
 purpose, distinctly sound of something more than the patient attending the
 stroke of death when it shall come; for there are several accidents in
 life far worse to suffer than death itself. Witness the Lacedaemonian boy
 taken by Antigonus, and sold for a slave, who being by his master
 commanded to some base employment: "Thou shalt see," says the boy, "whom
 thou hast bought; it would be a shame for me to serve, being so near the
 reach of liberty," and having so said, threw himself from the top of the
 house. Antipater severely threatening the Lacedaemonians, that he might
 the better incline them to acquiesce in a certain demand of his: "If thou
 threatenest us with more than death," replied they, "we shall the more
 willingly die"; and to Philip, having written them word that he would
 frustrate all their enterprises: "What, wilt thou also hinder us from
 dying?" This is the meaning of the sentence, "That the wise man lives as
 long as he ought, not so long as he can; and that the most obliging
 present Nature has made us, and which takes from us all colour of
 complaint of our condition, is to have delivered into our own custody the
 keys of life; she has only ordered, one door into life, but a hundred
 thousand ways out. We may be straitened for earth to live upon, but earth
 sufficient to die upon can never be wanting, as Boiocalus answered the
 Romans."?[Tacitus, Annal., xiii. 56.]?Why dost thou complain
 of this world? it detains thee not; thy own cowardice is the cause, if
 thou livest in pain. There needs no more to die but to will to die:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ubique mors est; optime hoc cavit deus.
 Eripere vitam nemo non homini potest;
 At nemo mortem; mille ad hanc aditus patent."

 ["Death is everywhere: heaven has well provided for that. Any one
 may deprive us of life; no one can deprive us of death. To death
 there are a thousand avenues."?Seneca, Theb:, i, I, 151.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Neither is it a recipe for one disease only; death is the infallible cure
 of all; 'tis a most assured port that is never to be feared, and very
 often to be sought. It comes all to one, whether a man give himself his
 end, or stays to receive it by some other means; whether he pays before
 his day, or stay till his day of payment come; from whencesoever it comes,
 it is still his; in what part soever the thread breaks, there's the end of
 the clue. The most voluntary death is the finest. Life depends upon the
 pleasure of others; death upon our own. We ought not to accommodate
 ourselves to our own humour in anything so much as in this. Reputation is
 not concerned in such an enterprise; 'tis folly to be concerned by any
 such apprehension. Living is slavery if the liberty of dying be wanting.
 The ordinary method of cure is carried on at the expense of life; they
 torment us with caustics, incisions, and amputations of limbs; they
 interdict aliment and exhaust our blood; one step farther and we are cured
 indeed and effectually. Why is not the jugular vein as much at our
 disposal as the median vein? For a desperate disease a desperate cure.
 Servius the grammarian, being tormented with the gout, could think of no
 better remedy than to apply poison to his legs, to deprive them of their
 sense; let them be gouty at their will, so they were insensible of pain.
 God gives us leave enough to go when He is pleased to reduce us to such a
 condition that to live is far worse than to die. 'Tis weakness to truckle
 under infirmities, but it's madness to nourish them. The Stoics say, that
 it is living according to nature in a wise man to, take his leave of life,
 even in the height of prosperity, if he do it opportunely; and in a fool
 to prolong it, though he be miserable, provided he be not indigent of
 those things which they repute to be according to nature. As I do not
 offend the law against thieves when I embezzle my own money and cut my own
 purse; nor that against incendiaries when I burn my own wood; so am I not
 under the lash of those made against murderers for having deprived myself
 of my own life. Hegesias said, that as the condition of life did, so the
 condition of death ought to depend upon our own choice. And Diogenes
 meeting the philosopher Speusippus, so blown up with an inveterate dropsy
 that he was fain to be carried in a litter, and by him saluted with the
 compliment, "I wish you good health." "No health to thee," replied the
 other, "who art content to live in such a condition."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in fact, not long after, Speusippus, weary of so languishing a state
 of life, found a means to die.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But this does not pass without admitting a dispute: for many are of
 opinion that we cannot quit this garrison of the world without the express
 command of Him who has placed us in it; and that it appertains to God who
 has placed us here, not for ourselves only but for His Glory and the
 service of others, to dismiss us when it shall best please Him, and not
 for us to depart without His licence: that we are not born for ourselves
 only, but for our country also, the laws of which require an account from
 us upon the score of their own interest, and have an action of
 manslaughter good against us; and if these fail to take cognisance of the
 fact, we are punished in the other world as deserters of our duty:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Proxima deinde tenent maesti loca, qui sibi letum
 Insontes peperere manu, lucemque perosi
 Proiecere animas."

 ["Thence the sad ones occupy the next abodes, who, though free
 from guilt, were by their own hands slain, and, hating light,
 sought death."?AEneid, vi. 434.]
</pre>
 <p>
 There is more constancy in suffering the chain we are tied to than in
 breaking it, and more pregnant evidence of fortitude in Regulus than in
 Cato; 'tis indiscretion and impatience that push us on to these
 precipices: no accidents can make true virtue turn her back; she seeks and
 requires evils, pains, and grief, as the things by which she is nourished
 and supported; the menaces of tyrants, racks, and tortures serve only to
 animate and rouse her:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
 Nigrae feraci frondis in Algido,
 Per damma, percmdes, ab ipso
 Ducit opes, animumque ferro."

 ["As in Mount Algidus, the sturdy oak even from the axe itself
 derives new vigour and life."?Horace, Od., iv. 4, 57.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And as another says:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Non est, ut putas, virtus, pater,
 Timere vitam; sed malis ingentibus
 Obstare, nec se vertere, ac retro dare."

 ["Father, 'tis no virtue to fear life, but to withstand great
 misfortunes, nor turn back from them."?Seneca, Theb., i. 190.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Or as this:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Rebus in adversis facile est contemnere mortem
 Fortius ille facit, qui miser esse potest."

 ["It is easy in adversity to despise death; but he acts more
 bravely, who can live wretched."?Martial, xi. 56, 15.]
</pre>
 <p>
 'Tis cowardice, not virtue, to lie squat in a furrow, under a tomb, to
 evade the blows of fortune; virtue never stops nor goes out of her path,
 for the greatest storm that blows:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Si fractus illabatur orbis,
 Impavidum ferient ruinae."

 ["Should the world's axis crack, the ruins will but crush
 a fearless head."?Horace, Od., iii. 3, 7.]
</pre>
 <p>
 For the most part, the flying from other inconveniences brings us to this;
 nay, endeavouring to evade death, we often run into its very mouth:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Hic, rogo, non furor est, ne moriare, mori?"

 ["Tell me, is it not madness, that one should die for fear
 of dying?"?Martial, ii. 80, 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 like those who, from fear of a precipice, throw themselves headlong into
 it;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Multos in summa pericula misfit
 Venturi timor ipse mali: fortissimus ille est,
 Qui promptus metuenda pati, si cominus instent,
 Et differre potest."

 ["The fear of future ills often makes men run into extreme danger;
 he is truly brave who boldly dares withstand the mischiefs he
 apprehends, when they confront him and can be deferred."
 ?Lucan, vii. 104.]

 "Usque adeo, mortis formidine, vitae
 Percipit humanos odium, lucisque videndae,
 Ut sibi consciscant moerenti pectore lethum
 Obliti fontem curarum hunc esse timorem."

 ["Death to that degree so frightens some men, that causing them to
 hate both life and light, they kill themselves, miserably forgetting
 that this same fear is the fountain of their cares."
 ?Lucretius, iii. 79.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Plato, in his Laws, assigns an ignominious sepulture to him who has
 deprived his nearest and best friend, namely himself, of life and his
 destined course, being neither compelled so to do by public judgment, by
 any sad and inevitable accident of fortune, nor by any insupportable
 disgrace, but merely pushed on by cowardice and the imbecility of a
 timorous soul. And the opinion that makes so little of life, is
 ridiculous; for it is our being, 'tis all we have. Things of a nobler and
 more elevated being may, indeed, reproach ours; but it is against nature
 for us to contemn and make little account of ourselves; 'tis a disease
 particular to man, and not discerned in any other creatures, to hate and
 despise itself. And it is a vanity of the same stamp to desire to be
 something else than what we are; the effect of such a desire does not at
 all touch us, forasmuch as it is contradicted and hindered in itself. He
 that desires of a man to be made an angel, does nothing for himself; he
 would be never the better for it; for, being no more, who shall rejoice or
 be sensible of this benefit for him.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Debet enim, misere cui forti, aegreque futurum est,
 Ipse quoque esse in eo turn tempore, cum male possit
 Accidere."

 ["For he to whom misery and pain are to be in the future, must
 himself then exist, when these ills befall him."
 ?Idem, ibid., 874.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Security, indolence, impassability, the privation of the evils of this
 life, which we pretend to purchase at the price of dying, are of no manner
 of advantage to us: that man evades war to very little purpose who can
 have no fruition of peace; and as little to the purpose does he avoid
 trouble who cannot enjoy repose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Amongst those of the first of these two opinions, there has been great
 debate, what occasions are sufficient to justify the meditation of
 self-murder, which they call "A reasonable exit."?[ Diogenes
 Laertius, Life of Zeno.]?For though they say that men must often die
 for trivial causes, seeing those that detain us in life are of no very
 great weight, yet there is to be some limit. There are fantastic and
 senseless humours that have prompted not only individual men, but whole
 nations to destroy themselves, of which I have elsewhere given some
 examples; and we further read of the Milesian virgins, that by a frantic
 compact they hanged themselves one after another till the magistrate took
 order in it, enacting that the bodies of such as should be found so hanged
 should be drawn by the same halter stark naked through the city. When
 Therykion tried to persuade Cleomenes to despatch himself, by reason of
 the ill posture of his affairs, and, having missed a death of more honour
 in the battle he had lost, to accept of this the second in honour to it,
 and not to give the conquerors leisure to make him undergo either an
 ignominious death or an infamous life; Cleomenes, with a courage truly
 Stoic and Lacedaemonian, rejected his counsel as unmanly and mean; "that,"
 said he, "is a remedy that can never be wanting, but which a man is never
 to make use of, whilst there is an inch of hope remaining": telling him,
 "that it was sometimes constancy and valour to live; that he would that
 even his death should be of use to his country, and would make of it an
 act of honour and virtue." Therykion, notwithstanding, thought himself in
 the right, and did his own business; and Cleomenes afterwards did the
 same, but not till he had first tried the utmost malevolence of fortune.
 All the inconveniences in the world are not considerable enough that a man
 should die to evade them; and, besides, there being so many, so sudden and
 unexpected changes in human things, it is hard rightly to judge when we
 are at the end of our hope:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sperat et in saeva victus gladiator arena,
 Sit licet infesto pollice turba minax."

 ["The gladiator conquered in the lists hopes on, though the
 menacing spectators, turning their thumb, order him to die."
 ?Pentadius, De Spe, ap. Virgilii Catadecta.]
</pre>
 <p>
 All things, says an old adage, are to be hoped for by a man whilst he
 lives; ay, but, replies Seneca, why should this rather be always running
 in a man's head that fortune can do all things for the living man, than
 this, that fortune has no power over him that knows how to die? Josephus,
 when engaged in so near and apparent danger, a whole people being
 violently bent against him, that there was no visible means of escape,
 nevertheless, being, as he himself says, in this extremity counselled by
 one of his friends to despatch himself, it was well for him that he yet
 maintained himself in hope, for fortune diverted the accident beyond all
 human expectation, so that he saw himself delivered without any manner of
 inconvenience. Whereas Brutus and Cassius, on the contrary, threw away the
 remains of the Roman liberty, of which they were the sole protectors, by
 the precipitation and temerity wherewith they killed themselves before the
 due time and a just occasion. Monsieur d'Anguien, at the battle of
 Serisolles, twice attempted to run himself through, despairing of the
 fortune of the day, which went indeed very untowardly on that side of the
 field where he was engaged, and by that precipitation was very near
 depriving himself of the enjoyment of so brave a victory. I have seen a
 hundred hares escape out of the very teeth of the greyhounds:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Aliquis carnifici suo superstes fuit."

 ["Some have survived their executioners."?Seneca, Ep., 13.]

 "Multa dies, variusque labor mutabilis nevi
 Rettulit in melius; multos alterna revisens
 Lusit, et in solido rursus fortuna locavit."

 ["Length of days, and the various labour of changeful time, have
 brought things to a better state; fortune turning, shews a reverse
 face, and again restores men to prosperity."?AEneid, xi. 425.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Piny says there are but three sorts of diseases, to escape which a man has
 good title to destroy himself; the worst of which is the stone in the
 bladder, when the urine is suppressed.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> ["In the quarto edition of these essays, in 1588, Pliny is said to
 mention two more, viz., a pain in the stomach and a headache, which,
 he says (lib. xxv. c. 9.), were the only three distempers almost
 for which men killed themselves."]
</pre>
 <p>
 Seneca says those only which for a long time are discomposing the
 functions of the soul. And some there have been who, to avoid a worse
 death, have chosen one to their own liking. Democritus, general of the
 AEtolians, being brought prisoner to Rome, found means to make his escape
 by night: but close pursued by his keepers, rather than suffer himself to
 be retaken, he fell upon his own sword and died. Antinous and Theodotus,
 their city of Epirus being reduced by the Romans to the last extremity,
 gave the people counsel universally to kill themselves; but, these
 preferring to give themselves up to the enemy, the two chiefs went to seek
 the death they desired, rushing furiously upon the enemy, with intention
 to strike home but not to ward a blow. The Island of Gozzo being taken
 some years ago by the Turks, a Sicilian, who had two beautiful daughters
 marriageable, killed them both with his own hand, and their mother,
 running in to save them, to boot, which having done, sallying out of the
 house with a cross-bow and harquebus, with two shots he killed two of the
 Turks nearest to his door, and drawing his sword, charged furiously in
 amongst the rest, where he was suddenly enclosed and cut to pieces, by
 that means delivering his family and himself from slavery and dishonour.
 The Jewish women, after having circumcised their children, threw them and
 themselves down a precipice to avoid the cruelty of Antigonus. I have been
 told of a person of condition in one of our prisons, that his friends,
 being informed that he would certainly be condemned, to avoid the ignominy
 of such a death suborned a priest to tell him that the only means of his
 deliverance was to recommend himself to such a saint, under such and such
 vows, and to fast eight days together without taking any manner of
 nourishment, what weakness or faintness soever he might find in himself
 during the time; he followed their advice, and by that means destroyed
 himself before he was aware, not dreaming of death or any danger in the
 experiment. Scribonia advising her nephew Libo to kill himself rather than
 await the stroke of justice, told him that it was to do other people's
 business to preserve his life to put it after into the hands of those who
 within three or four days would fetch him to execution, and that it was to
 serve his enemies to keep his blood to gratify their malice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We read in the Bible that Nicanor, the persecutor of the law of God,
 having sent his soldiers to seize upon the good old man Razis, surnamed in
 honour of his virtue the father of the Jews: the good man, seeing no other
 remedy, his gates burned down, and the enemies ready to seize him,
 choosing rather to die nobly than to fall into the hands of his wicked
 adversaries and suffer himself to be cruelly butchered by them, contrary
 to the honour of his rank and quality, stabbed himself with his own sword,
 but the blow, for haste, not having been given home, he ran and threw
 himself from the top of a wall headlong among them, who separating
 themselves and making room, he pitched directly upon his head;
 notwithstanding which, feeling yet in himself some remains of life, he
 renewed his courage, and starting up upon his feet all bloody and wounded
 as he was, and making his way through the crowd to a precipitous rock,
 there, through one of his wounds, drew out his bowels, which, tearing and
 pulling to pieces with both his hands, he threw amongst his pursuers, all
 the while attesting and invoking the Divine vengeance upon them for their
 cruelty and injustice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of violences offered to the conscience, that against the chastity of woman
 is, in my opinion, most to be avoided, forasmuch as there is a certain
 pleasure naturally mixed with it, and for that reason the dissent therein
 cannot be sufficiently perfect and entire, so that the violence seems to
 be mixed with a little consent of the forced party. The ecclesiastical
 history has several examples of devout persons who have embraced death to
 secure them from the outrages prepared by tyrants against their religion
 and honour. Pelagia and Sophronia, both canonised, the first of these
 precipitated herself with her mother and sisters into the river to avoid
 being forced by some soldiers, and the last also killed herself to avoid
 being ravished by the Emperor Maxentius.

to persuade the ladies of our age rather to take any other course than to
enter into the horrid meditation of such a despair. I am sorry he had
never heard, that he might have inserted it amongst his other stories,
the saying of a woman, which was told me at Toulouse, who had passed
through the handling of some soldiers: "God be praised," said she, "that
once at least in my life I have had my fill without sin." In truth,
these cruelties are very unworthy the French good nature, and also, God
be thanked, our air is very well purged of them since this good advice:
'tis enough that they say "no" in doing it, according to the rule of the
good Marot.

 History is everywhere full of those who by a thousand ways have exchanged
 a painful and irksome life for death. Lucius Aruntius killed himself, to
 fly, he said, both the future and the past. Granius Silvanus and Statius
 Proximus, after having been pardoned by Nero, killed themselves; either
 disdaining to live by the favour of so wicked a man, or that they might
 not be troubled, at some other time, to obtain a second pardon,
 considering the proclivity of his nature to suspect and credit accusations
 against worthy men. Spargapises, son of Queen Tomyris, being a prisoner of
 war to Cyrus, made use of the first favour Cyrus shewed him, in commanding
 him to be unbound, to kill himself, having pretended to no other benefit
 of liberty, but only to be revenged of himself for the disgrace of being
 taken. Boges, governor in Eion for King Xerxes, being besieged by the
 Athenian army under the conduct of Cimon, refused the conditions offered,
 that he might safe return into Asia with all his wealth, impatient to
 survive the loss of a place his master had given him to keep; wherefore,
 having defended the city to the last extremity, nothing being left to eat,
 he first threw all the gold and whatever else the enemy could make booty
 of into the river Strymon, and then causing a great pile to be set on
 fire, and the throats of all the women, children, concubines, and servants
 to be cut, he threw their bodies into the fire, and at last leaped into it
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ninachetuen, an Indian lord, so soon as he heard the first whisper of the
 Portuguese Viceroy's determination to dispossess him, without any apparent
 cause, of his command in Malacca, to transfer it to the King of Campar, he
 took this resolution with himself: he caused a scaffold, more long than
 broad, to be erected, supported by columns royally adorned with tapestry
 and strewed with flowers and abundance of perfumes; all which being
 prepared, in a robe of cloth of gold, set full of jewels of great value,
 he came out into the street, and mounted the steps to the scaffold, at one
 corner of which he had a pile lighted of aromatic wood. Everybody ran to
 see to what end these unusual preparations were made; when Ninachetuen,
 with a manly but displeased countenance, set forth how much he had obliged
 the Portuguese nation, and with how unspotted fidelity he had carried
 himself in his charge; that having so often, sword in hand, manifested in
 the behalf of others, that honour was much more dear to him than life, he
 was not to abandon the concern of it for himself: that fortune denying him
 all means of opposing the affront designed to be put upon him, his courage
 at least enjoined him to free himself from the sense of it, and not to
 serve for a fable to the people, nor for a triumph to men less deserving
 than himself; which having said he leaped into the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sextilia, wife of Scaurus, and Paxaea, wife of Labeo, to encourage their
 husbands to avoid the dangers that pressed upon them, wherein they had no
 other share than conjugal affection, voluntarily sacrificed their own
 lives to serve them in this extreme necessity for company and example.
 What they did for their husbands, Cocceius Nerva did for his country, with
 less utility though with equal affection: this great lawyer, flourishing
 in health, riches, reputation, and favour with the Emperor, had no other
 cause to kill himself but the sole compassion of the miserable state of
 the Roman Republic. Nothing can be added to the beauty of the death of the
 wife of Fulvius, a familiar favourite of Augustus: Augustus having
 discovered that he had vented an important secret he had entrusted him
 withal, one morning that he came to make his court, received him very
 coldly and looked frowningly upon him. He returned home, full of, despair,
 where he sorrowfully told his wife that, having fallen into this
 misfortune, he was resolved to kill himself: to which she roundly replied,
 "'tis but reason you should, seeing that having so often experienced the
 incontinence of my tongue, you could not take warning: but let me kill
 myself first," and without any more saying ran herself through the body
 with a sword. Vibius Virrius, despairing of the safety of his city
 besieged by the Romans and of their mercy, in the last deliberation of his
 city's senate, after many arguments conducing to that end, concluded that
 the most noble means to escape fortune was by their own hands: telling
 them that the enemy would have them in honour, and Hannibal would be
 sensible how many faithful friends he had abandoned; inviting those who
 approved of his advice to come to a good supper he had ready at home,
 where after they had eaten well, they would drink together of what he had
 prepared; a beverage, said he, that will deliver our bodies from torments,
 our souls from insult, and our eyes and ears from the sense of so many
 hateful mischiefs, as the conquered suffer from cruel and implacable
 conquerors. I have, said he, taken order for fit persons to throw our
 bodies into a funeral pile before my door so soon as we are dead. Many
 enough approved this high resolution, but few imitated it;
 seven-and-twenty senators followed him, who, after having tried to drown
 the thought of this fatal determination in wine, ended the feast with the
 mortal mess; and embracing one another, after they had jointly deplored
 the misfortune of their country, some retired home to their own houses,
 others stayed to be burned with Vibius in his funeral pyre; and were all
 of them so long in dying, the vapour of the wine having prepossessed the
 veins, and by that means deferred the effect of poison, that some of them
 were within an hour of seeing the enemy inside the walls of Capua, which
 was taken the next morning, and of undergoing the miseries they had at so
 dear a rate endeavoured to avoid. Jubellius Taurea, another citizen of the
 same country, the Consul Fulvius returning from the shameful butchery he
 had made of two hundred and twenty-five senators, called him back fiercely
 by name, and having made him stop: "Give the word," said he, "that
 somebody may dispatch me after the massacre of so many others, that thou
 mayest boast to have killed a much more valiant man than thyself."
 Fulvius, disdaining him as a man out of his wits, and also having received
 letters from Rome censuring the inhumanity of his execution which tied his
 hands, Jubellius proceeded: "Since my country has been taken, my friends
 dead, and having with my own hands slain my wife and children to rescue
 them from the desolation of this ruin, I am denied to die the death of my
 fellow-citizens, let me borrow from virtue vengeance on this hated life,"
 and therewithal drawing a short sword he carried concealed about him, he
 ran it through his own bosom, falling down backward, and expiring at the
 consul's feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Alexander, laying siege to a city of the Indies, those within, finding
 themselves very hardly set, put on a vigorous resolution to deprive him of
 the pleasure of his victory, and accordingly burned themselves in general,
 together with their city, in despite of his humanity: a new kind of war,
 where the enemies sought to save them, and they to destroy themselves,
 doing to make themselves sure of death, all that men do to secure life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Astapa, a city of Spain, finding itself weak in walls and defence to
 withstand the Romans, the inhabitants made a heap of all their riches and
 furniture in the public place; and, having ranged upon this heap all the
 women and children, and piled them round with wood and other combustible
 matter to take sudden fire, and left fifty of their young men for the
 execution of that whereon they had resolved, they made a desperate sally,
 where for want of power to overcome, they caused themselves to be every
 man slain. The fifty, after having massacred every living soul throughout
 the whole city, and put fire to this pile, threw themselves lastly into
 it, finishing their generous liberty, rather after an insensible, than
 after a sorrowful and disgraceful manner, giving the enemy to understand,
 that if fortune had been so pleased, they had as well the courage to
 snatch from them victory as they had to frustrate and render it dreadful,
 and even mortal to those who, allured by the splendour of the gold melting
 in this flame, having approached it, a great number were there suffocated
 and burned, being kept from retiring by the crowd that followed after.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Abydeans, being pressed by King Philip, put on the same resolution;
 but, not having time, they could not put it 'in effect. The king, who was
 struck with horror at the rash precipitation of this execution (the
 treasure and movables that they had condemned to the flames being first
 seized), drawing off his soldiers, granted them three days' time to kill
 themselves in, that they might do it with more order and at greater ease:
 which time they filled with blood and slaughter beyond the utmost excess
 of all hostile cruelty, so that not so much as any one soul was left alive
 that had power to destroy itself. There are infinite examples of like
 popular resolutions which seem the more fierce and cruel in proportion as
 the effect is more universal, and yet are really less so than when singly
 executed; what arguments and persuasion cannot do with individual men,
 they can do with all, the ardour of society ravishing particular
 judgments.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The condemned who would live to be executed in the reign of Tiberius,
 forfeited their goods and were denied the rites of sepulture; those who,
 by killing themselves, anticipated it, were interred, and had liberty to
 dispose of their estates by will.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But men sometimes covet death out of hope of a greater good. "I desire,"
 says St. Paul, "to be with Christ," and "who shall rid me of these bands?"
 Cleombrotus of Ambracia, having read Plato's Pheedo, entered into so great
 a desire of the life to come that, without any other occasion, he threw
 himself into the sea. By which it appears how improperly we call this
 voluntary dissolution, despair, to which the eagerness of hope often
 inclines us, and, often, a calm and temperate desire proceeding from a
 mature and deliberate judgment. Jacques du Chastel, bishop of Soissons, in
 St. Louis's foreign expedition, seeing the king and whole army upon the
 point of returning into France, leaving the affairs of religion imperfect,
 took a resolution rather to go into Paradise; wherefore, having taken
 solemn leave of his friends, he charged alone, in the sight of every one,
 into the enemy's army, where he was presently cut to pieces. In a certain
 kingdom of the new discovered world, upon a day of solemn procession, when
 the idol they adore is drawn about in public upon a chariot of marvellous
 greatness; besides that many are then seen cutting off pieces of their
 flesh to offer to him, there are a number of others who prostrate
 themselves upon the place, causing themselves to be crushed and broken to
 pieces under the weighty wheels, to obtain the veneration of sanctity
 after death, which is accordingly paid them. The death of the bishop,
 sword in hand, has more of magnanimity in it, and less of sentiment, the
 ardour of combat taking away part of the latter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There are some governments who have taken upon them to regulate the
 justice and opportunity of voluntary death. In former times there was kept
 in our city of Marseilles a poison prepared out of hemlock, at the public
 charge, for those who had a mind to hasten their end, having first, before
 the six hundred, who were their senate, given account of the reasons and
 motives of their design, and it was not otherwise lawful, than by leave
 from the magistrate and upon just occasion to do violence to themselves.?[Valerius
 Maximus, ii. 6, 7.]?The same law was also in use in other places.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sextus Pompeius, in his expedition into Asia, touched at the isle of Cea
 in Negropont: it happened whilst he was there, as we have it from one that
 was with him, that a woman of great quality, having given an account to
 her citizens why she was resolved to put an end to her life, invited
 Pompeius to her death, to render it the more honourable, an invitation
 that he accepted; and having long tried in vain by the power of his
 eloquence, which was very great, and persuasion, to divert her from that
 design, he acquiesced in the end in her own will. She had passed the age
 of four score and ten in a very happy state, both of body and mind; being
 then laid upon her bed, better dressed than ordinary and leaning upon her
 elbow, "The gods," said she, "O Sextus Pompeius, and rather those I leave
 than those I go to seek, reward thee, for that thou hast not disdained to
 be both the counsellor of my life and the witness of my death. For my
 part, having always experienced the smiles of fortune, for fear lest the
 desire of living too long may make me see a contrary face, I am going, by
 a happy end, to dismiss the remains of my soul, leaving behind two
 daughters of my body and a legion of nephews"; which having said, with
 some exhortations to her family to live in peace, she divided amongst them
 her goods, and recommending her domestic gods to her eldest daughter, she
 boldly took the bowl that contained the poison, and having made her vows
 and prayers to Mercury to conduct her to some happy abode in the other
 world, she roundly swallowed the mortal poison. This being done, she
 entertained the company with the progress of its operation, and how the
 cold by degrees seized the several parts of her body one after another,
 till having in the end told them it began to seize upon her heart and
 bowels, she called her daughters to do the last office and close her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pliny tells us of a certain Hyperborean nation where, by reason of the
 sweet temperature of the air, lives rarely ended but by the voluntary
 surrender of the inhabitants, who, being weary of and satiated with
 living, had the custom, at a very old age, after having made good cheer,
 to precipitate themselves into the sea from the top of a certain rock,
 assigned for that service. Pain and the fear of a worse death seem to me
 the most excusable incitements.

 CHAPTER IV??TO-MORROW'S A NEW DAY
 </h2>
 <p>
 I give, as it seems to me, with good reason the palm to Jacques Amyot of
 all our French writers, not only for the simplicity and purity of his
 language, wherein he excels all others, nor for his constancy in going
 through so long a work, nor for the depth of his knowledge, having been
 able so successfully to smooth and unravel so knotty and intricate an
 author (for let people tell me what they will, I understand nothing of
 Greek; but I meet with sense so well united and maintained throughout his
 whole translation, that certainly he either knew the true fancy of the
 author, or having, by being long conversant with him, imprinted a vivid
 and general idea of that of Plutarch in his soul, he has delivered us
 nothing that either derogates from or contradicts him), but above all, I
 am the most taken with him for having made so discreet a choice of a book
 so worthy and of so great utility wherewith to present his country. We
 ignorant fellows had been lost, had not this book raised us out of the
 dirt; by this favour of his we dare now speak and write; the ladies are
 able to read to schoolmasters; 'tis our breviary. If this good man be yet
 living, I would recommend to him Xenophon, to do as much by that; 'tis a
 much more easy task than the other, and consequently more proper for his
 age. And, besides, though I know not how, methinks he does briskly?and
 clearly enough trip over steps another would have stumbled at, yet
 nevertheless his style seems to be more his own where he does not
 encounter those difficulties, and rolls away at his own ease.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was just now reading this passage where Plutarch says of himself, that
 Rusticus being present at a declamation of his at Rome, there received a
 packet from the emperor, and deferred to open it till all was done: for
 which, says he, all the company highly applauded the gravity of this
 person. 'Tis true, that being upon the subject of curiosity and of that
 eager passion for news, which makes us with so much indiscretion and
 impatience leave all to entertain a newcomer, and without any manner of
 respect or outcry, tear open on a sudden, in what company soever, the
 letters that are delivered to us, he had reason to applaud the gravity of
 Rusticus upon this occasion; and might moreover have added to it the
 commendation of his civility and courtesy, that would not interrupt the
 current of his declamation. But I doubt whether any one can commend his
 prudence; for receiving unexpected letters, and especially from an
 emperor, it might have fallen out that the deferring to read them might
 have been of great prejudice. The vice opposite to curiosity is
 negligence, to which I naturally incline, and wherein I have seen some men
 so extreme that one might have found letters sent them three or four days
 before, still sealed up in their pockets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I never open any letters directed to another; not only those intrusted
 with me, but even such as fortune has guided to my hand; and am angry with
 myself if my eyes unawares steal any contents of letters of importance he
 is reading when I stand near a great man. Never was man less inquisitive
 or less prying into other men's affairs than I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In our fathers' days, Monsieur de Boutieres had like to have lost Turin
 from having, while engaged in good company at supper, delayed to read
 information that was sent him of the treason plotted against that city
 where he commanded. And this very Plutarch has given me to understand,
 that Julius Caesar had preserved himself, if, going to the Senate the day
 he was assassinated by the conspirators, he had read a note which was
 presented to him by, the way. He tells also the story of Archias, the
 tyrant of Thebes, that the night before the execution of the design
 Pelopidas had plotted to kill him to restore his country to liberty, he
 had a full account sent him in writing by another Archias, an Athenian, of
 the whole conspiracy, and that, this packet having been delivered to him
 while he sat at supper, he deferred the opening of it, saying, which
 afterwards turned to a proverb in Greece, "Business to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A wise man may, I think, out of respect to another, as not to disturb the
 company, as Rusticus did, or not to break off another affair of importance
 in hand, defer to read or hear any new thing that is brought him; but for
 his own interest or particular pleasure, especially if he be a public
 minister, that he will not interrupt his dinner or break his sleep is
 inexcusable. And there was anciently at Rome, the consular place, as they
 called it, which was the most honourable at the table, as being a place of
 most liberty, and of more convenient access to those who came in to speak
 to the person seated there; by which it appears, that being at meat, they
 did not totally abandon the concern of other affairs and incidents. But
 when all is said, it is very hard in human actions to give so exact a rule
 upon moral reasons, that fortune will not therein maintain her own right.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V??OF CONSCIENCE
 </h2>
 <p>
 The Sieur de la Brousse, my brother, and I, travelling one day together
 during the time of our civil wars, met a gentleman of good sort. He was of
 the contrary party, though I did not know so much, for he pretended
 otherwise: and the mischief on't is, that in this sort of war the cards
 are so shuffled, your enemy not being distinguished from yourself by any
 apparent mark either of language or habit, and being nourished under the
 same law, air, and manners, it is very hard to avoid disorder and
 confusion. This made me afraid myself of meeting any of our troops in a
 place where I was not known, that I might not be in fear to tell my name,
 and peradventure of something worse; as it had befallen me before, where,
 by such a mistake, I lost both men and horses, and amongst others an
 Italian gentleman my page, whom I bred with the greatest care and
 affection, was miserably slain, in whom a youth of great promise and
 expectation was extinguished. But the gentleman my brother and I met had
 so desperate, half-dead a fear upon him at meeting with any horse, or
 passing by any of the towns that held for the King, that I at last
 discovered it to be alarms of conscience. It seemed to the poor man as if
 through his visor and the crosses upon his cassock, one would have
 penetrated into his bosom and read the most secret intentions of his
 heart; so wonderful is the power of conscience. It makes us betray,
 accuse, and fight against ourselves, and for want of other witnesses, to
 give evidence against ourselves:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Occultum quatiens animo tortore flagellum."

 ["The torturer of the soul brandishing a sharp scourge within."
 ?Juvenal, iii. 195.]
</pre>
 <p>
 This story is in every child's mouth: Bessus the Paeonian, being
 reproached for wantonly pulling down a nest of young sparrows and killing
 them, replied, that he had reason to do so, seeing that those little birds
 never ceased falsely to accuse him of the murder of his father. This
 parricide had till then been concealed and unknown, but the revenging fury
 of conscience caused it to be discovered by him himself, who was to suffer
 for it. Hesiod corrects the saying of Plato, that punishment closely
 follows sin, it being, as he says, born at the same time with it. Whoever
 expects punishment already suffers it, and whoever has deserved it expects
 it. Wickedness contrives torments against itself:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Malum consilium consultori pessimum."

 ["Ill designs are worst to the contriver."
 ?Apud Aul. Gellium, iv. 5.]
</pre>
 <p>
 as the wasp stings and hurts another, but most of all itself, for it there
 loses its sting and its use for ever,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Vitasque in vulnere ponunt."

 ["And leave their own lives in the wound."
 ?Virgil, Geo., iv. 238.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Cantharides have somewhere about them, by a contrariety of nature, a
 counterpoison against their poison. In like manner, at the same time that
 men take delight in vice, there springs in the conscience a displeasure
 that afflicts us sleeping and waking with various tormenting imaginations:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Quippe ubi se multi, per somnia saepe loquentes,
 Aut morbo delirantes, protraxe ferantur,
 Et celata diu in medium peccata dedisse."

 ["Surely where many, often talking in their sleep, or raving in
 disease, are said to have betrayed themselves, and to have given
 publicity to offences long concealed."?Lucretius, v. 1157.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Apollodorus dreamed that he saw himself flayed by the Scythians and
 afterwards boiled in a cauldron, and that his heart muttered these words
 "I am the cause of all these mischiefs that have befallen thee." Epicurus
 said that no hiding-hole could conceal the wicked, since they could never
 assure themselves of being hid whilst their conscience discovered them to
 themselves.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Prima est haec ultio, quod se
 Judice nemo nocens absohitur."

 ["Tis the first punishment of sin that no man absolves himself." or:
 "This is the highest revenge, that by its judgment no offender is
 absolved."?Juvenal, xiii. 2.]
</pre>
 <p>
 As an ill conscience fills us with fear, so a good one gives us greater
 confidence and assurance; and I can truly say that I have gone through
 several hazards with a more steady pace in consideration of the secret
 knowledge I had of my own will and the innocence of my intentions:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Conscia mens ut cuique sua est, ita concipit intra
 Pectora pro facto spemque metumque suo."

 ["As a man's conscience is, so within hope or fear prevails, suiting
 to his design."?Ovid, Fast., i. 485.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Of this are a thousand examples; but it will be enough to instance three
 of one and the same person. Scipio, being one day accused before the
 people of Rome of some crimes of a very high nature, instead of excusing
 himself or flattering his judges: "It will become you well," said he, "to
 sit in judgment upon a head, by whose means you have the power to judge
 all the world." Another time, all the answer he gave to several
 impeachments brought against him by a tribune of the people, instead of
 making his defence: "Let us go, citizens," said he, "let us go render
 thanks to the gods for the victory they gave me over the Carthaginians as
 this day," and advancing himself before towards the Temple, he had
 presently all the assembly and his very accuser himself following at his
 heels. And Petilius, having been set on by Cato to demand an account of
 the money that had passed through his hands in the province of Antioch,
 Scipio being come into the senate to that purpose, produced a book from
 under his robe, wherein he told them was an exact account of his receipts
 and disbursements; but being required to deliver it to the prothonotary to
 be examined, he refused, saying, he would not do himself so great a
 disgrace; and in the presence of the whole senate tore the book with his
 own hands to pieces. I do not believe that the most seared conscience
 could have counterfeited so great an assurance. He had naturally too high
 a spirit and was accustomed to too high a fortune, says Titius Livius, to
 know how to be criminal, and to lower himself to the meanness of defending
 his innocence. The putting men to the rack is a dangerous invention, and
 seems to be rather a trial of patience than of truth. Both he who has the
 fortitude to endure it conceals the truth, and he who has not: for why
 should pain sooner make me confess what really is, than force me to say
 what is not? And, on the contrary, if he who is not guilty of that whereof
 he is accused, has the courage to undergo those torments, why should not
 he who is guilty have the same, so fair a reward as life being in his
 prospect? I believe the ground of this invention proceeds from the
 consideration of the force of conscience: for, to the guilty, it seems to
 assist the rack to make him confess his fault and to shake his resolution;
 and, on the other side, that it fortifies the innocent against the
 torture. But when all is done, 'tis, in plain truth, a trial full of
 uncertainty and danger what would not a man say, what would not a man do,
 to avoid so intolerable torments?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Etiam innocentes cogit mentiri dolor."

 ["Pain will make even the innocent lie."?Publius Syrus, De Dolore.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Whence it comes to pass, that him whom the judge has racked that he may
 not die innocent, he makes him die both innocent and racked. A thousand
 and a thousand have charged their own heads by false confessions, amongst
 whom I place Philotas, considering the circumstances of the trial
 Alexander put upon him and the progress of his torture. But so it is that
 some say it is the least evil human weakness could invent; very inhumanly,
 notwithstanding, and to very little purpose, in my opinion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Many nations less barbarous in this than the Greeks and Romans who call
 them so, repute it horrible and cruel to torment and pull a man to pieces
 for a fault of which they are yet in doubt. How can he help your
 ignorance? Are not you unjust, that, not to kill him without cause, do
 worse than kill him? And that this is so, do but observe how often men
 prefer to die without reason than undergo this examination, more painful
 than execution itself; and that oft-times by its extremity anticipates
 execution, and perform it. I know not where I had this story, but it
 exactly matches the conscience of our justice in this particular. A
 country-woman, to a general of a very severe discipline, accused one of
 his soldiers that he had taken from her children the little soup meat she
 had left to nourish them withal, the army having consumed all the rest;
 but of this proof there was none. The general, after having cautioned the
 woman to take good heed to what she said, for that she would make herself
 guilty of a false accusation if she told a lie, and she persisting, he
 presently caused the soldier's belly to be ripped up to clear the truth of
 the fact, and the woman was found to be right. An instructive sentence.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI??USE MAKES PERFECT
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Tis not to be expected that argument and instruction, though we never so
 voluntarily surrender our belief to what is read to us, should be of force
 to lead us on so far as to action, if we do not, over and above, exercise
 and form the soul by experience to the course for which we design it; it
 will, otherwise, doubtless find itself at a loss when it comes to the
 pinch of the business. This is the reason why those amongst the
 philosophers who were ambitious to attain to a greater excellence, were
 not contented to await the severities of fortune in the retirement and
 repose of their own habitations, lest he should have surprised them raw
 and inexpert in the combat, but sallied out to meet her, and purposely
 threw themselves into the proof of difficulties. Some of them abandoned
 riches to exercise themselves in a voluntary poverty; others sought out
 labour and an austerity of life, to inure them to hardships and
 inconveniences; others have deprived themselves of their dearest members,
 as of sight, and of the instruments of generation, lest their too
 delightful and effeminate service should soften and debauch the stability
 of their souls.

 But in dying, which is the greatest work we have to do, practice can give
 us no assistance at all. A man may by custom fortify himself against pain,
 shame, necessity, and such-like accidents, but as to death, we can
 experiment it but once, and are all apprentices when we come to it. There
 have, anciently, been men so excellent managers of their time that they
 have tried even in death itself to relish and taste it, and who have bent
 their utmost faculties of mind to discover what this passage is, but they
 are none of them come back to tell us the news:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nemo expergitus exstat,
 Frigida quern semel est vitai pausa sequuta."

 ["No one wakes who has once fallen into the cold sleep of death."
 ?Lucretius, iii. 942]
</pre>
 <p>
 Julius Canus, a noble Roman, of singular constancy and virtue, having been
 condemned to die by that worthless fellow Caligula, besides many
 marvellous testimonies that he gave of his resolution, as he was just
 going to receive the stroke of the executioner, was asked by a
 philosopher, a friend of his: "Well, Canus, whereabout is your soul now?
 what is she doing? What are you thinking of?"?"I was thinking,"
 replied the other, "to keep myself ready, and the faculties of my mind
 full settled and fixed, to try if in this short and quick instant of
 death, I could perceive the motion of the soul when she parts from the
 body, and whether she has any sentiment at the separation, that I may
 after come again if I can, to acquaint my friends with it." This man
 philosophises not unto death only, but in death itself. What a strange
 assurance was this, and what bravery of courage, to desire his death
 should be a lesson to him, and to have leisure to think of other things in
 so great an affair:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Jus hoc animi morientis habebat."

 ["This mighty power of mind he had dying."-Lucan, viii. 636.]
</pre>
 <p>
 And yet I fancy, there is a certain way of making it familiar to us, and
 in some sort of making trial what it is. We may gain experience, if not
 entire and perfect, yet such, at least, as shall not be totally useless to
 us, and that may render us more confident and more assured. If we cannot
 overtake it, we may approach it and view it, and if we do not advance so
 far as the fort, we may at least discover and make ourselves acquainted
 with the avenues. It is not without reason that we are taught to consider
 sleep as a resemblance of death: with how great facility do we pass from
 waking to sleeping, and with how little concern do we lose the knowledge
 of light and of ourselves. Peradventure, the faculty of sleeping would
 seem useless and contrary to nature, since it deprives us of all action
 and sentiment, were it not that by it nature instructs us that she has
 equally made us to die as to live; and in life presents to us the eternal
 state she reserves for us after it, to accustom us to it and to take from
 us the fear of it. But such as have by violent accident fallen into a
 swoon, and in it have lost all sense, these, methinks, have been very near
 seeing the true and natural face of death; for as to the moment of the
 passage, it is not to be feared that it brings with it any pain or
 displeasure, forasmuch as we can have no feeling without leisure; our
 sufferings require time, which in death is so short, and so precipitous,
 that it must necessarily be insensible. They are the approaches that we
 are to fear, and these may fall within the limits of experience.

 Many things seem greater by imagination than they are in effect; I have
 passed a good part of my life in a perfect and entire health; I say, not
 only entire, but, moreover, sprightly and wanton. This state, so full of
 verdure, jollity, and vigour, made the consideration of sickness so
 formidable to me, that when I came to experience it, I found the attacks
 faint and easy in comparison with what I had apprehended. Of this I have
 daily experience; if I am under the shelter of a warm room, in a stormy
 and tempestuous night, I wonder how people can live abroad, and am
 afflicted for those who are out in the fields: if I am there myself, I do
 not wish to be anywhere else. This one thing of being always shut up in a
 chamber I fancied insupportable: but I was presently inured to be so
 imprisoned a week, nay a month together, in a very weak, disordered, and
 sad condition; and I have found that, in the time of my health, I much
 more pitied the sick, than I think myself to be pitied when I am so, and
 that the force of my imagination enhances near one-half of the essence and
 reality of the thing. I hope that when I come to die I shall find it the
 same, and that, after all, it is not worth the pains I take, so much
 preparation and so much assistance as I call in, to undergo the stroke.
 But, at all events, we cannot give ourselves too much advantage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the time of our third or second troubles (I do not well remember
 which), going one day abroad to take the air, about a league from my own
 house, which is seated in the very centre of all the bustle and mischief
 of the late civil wars in France; thinking myself in all security and so
 near to my retreat that I stood in need of no better equipage, I had taken
 a horse that went very easy upon his pace, but was not very strong. Being
 upon my return home, a sudden occasion falling out to make use of this
 horse in a kind of service that he was not accustomed to, one of my train,
 a lusty, tall fellow, mounted upon a strong German horse, that had a very
 ill mouth, fresh and vigorous, to play the brave and set on ahead of his
 fellows, comes thundering full speed in the very track where I was,
 rushing like a Colossus upon the little man and the little horse, with
 such a career of strength and weight, that he turned us both over and
 over, topsy-turvy with our heels in the air: so that there lay the horse
 overthrown and stunned with the fall, and I ten or twelve paces from him
 stretched out at length, with my face all battered and broken, my sword
 which I had had in my hand, above ten paces beyond that, and my belt
 broken all to pieces, without motion or sense any more than a stock. 'Twas
 the only swoon I was ever in till that hour in my life. Those who were
 with me, after having used all the means they could to bring me to myself,
 concluding me dead, took me up in their arms, and carried me with very
 much difficulty home to my house, which was about half a French league
 from thence. On the way, having been for more than two hours given over
 for a dead man, I began to move and to fetch my breath; for so great
 abundance of blood was fallen into my stomach, that nature had need to
 rouse her forces to discharge it. They then raised me upon my feet, where
 I threw off a whole bucket of clots of blood, as this I did also several
 times by the way. This gave me so much ease, that I began to recover a
 little life, but so leisurely and by so small advances, that my first
 sentiments were much nearer the approaches of death than life:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Perche, dubbiosa ancor del suo ritorno,
 Non s'assicura attonita la mente."

 ["For the soul, doubtful as to its return, could not compose itself"
 ?Tasso, Gierus. Lib., xii. 74.]
</pre>
 <p>
 The remembrance of this accident, which is very well imprinted in my
 memory, so naturally representing to me the image and idea of death, has
 in some sort reconciled me to that untoward adventure. When I first began
 to open my eyes, it was with so perplexed, so weak and dead a sight, that
 I could yet distinguish nothing but only discern the light:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Come quel ch'or apre, or'chiude
 Gli occhi, mezzo tra'l sonno e l'esser desto."

 ["As a man that now opens, now shuts his eyes, between sleep
 and waking."?Tasso, Gierus. Lib., viii., 26.]
</pre>
 <p>
 As to the functions of the soul, they advanced with the same pace and
 measure with those of the body. I saw myself all bloody, my doublet being
 stained all over with the blood I had vomited. The first thought that came
 into my mind was that I had a harquebuss shot in my head, and indeed, at
 the time there were a great many fired round about us. Methought my life
 but just hung upon my, lips: and I shut my eyes, to help, methought, to
 thrust it out, and took a pleasure in languishing and letting myself go.
 It was an imagination that only superficially floated upon my soul, as
 tender and weak as all the rest, but really, not only exempt from anything
 displeasing, but mixed with that sweetness that people feel when they
 glide into a slumber.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I believe it is the very same condition those people are in, whom we see
 swoon with weakness in the agony of death we pity them without cause,
 supposing them agitated with grievous dolours, or that their souls suffer
 under painful thoughts. It has ever been my belief, contrary to the
 opinion of many, and particularly of La Boetie, that those whom we see so
 subdued and stupefied at the approaches of their end, or oppressed with
 the length of the disease, or by accident of an apoplexy or falling
 sickness,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Vi morbi saepe coactus
 Ante oculos aliquis nostros, ut fulminis ictu,
 Concidit, et spumas agit; ingemit, et tremit artus;
 Desipit, extentat nervos, torquetur, anhelat,
 Inconstanter, et in jactando membra fatigat;"

 ["Often, compelled by the force of disease, some one as
 thunderstruck falls under our eyes, and foams, groans, and trembles,
 stretches, twists, breathes irregularly, and in paroxysms wears out
 his strength."?Lucretius, iii. 485.]
</pre>
 <p>
 or hurt in the head, whom we hear to mutter, and by fits to utter grievous
 groans; though we gather from these signs by which it seems as if they had
 some remains of consciousness, and that there are movements of the body; I
 have always believed, I say, both the body and the soul benumbed and
 asleep,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Vivit, et est vitae nescius ipse suae,"

 ["He lives, and does not know that he is alive."
 ?Ovid, Trist., i. 3, 12.]
</pre>
 <p>
 and could not believe that in so great a stupefaction of the members and
 so great a defection of the senses, the soul could maintain any force
 within to take cognisance of herself, and that, therefore, they had no
 tormenting reflections to make them consider and be sensible of the misery
 of their condition, and consequently were not much to be pitied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I can, for my part, think of no state so insupportable and dreadful, as to
 have the soul vivid and afflicted, without means to declare itself; as one
 should say of such as are sent to execution with their tongues first cut
 out (were it not that in this kind of dying, the most silent seems to me
 the most graceful, if accompanied with a grave and constant countenance);
 or if those miserable prisoners, who fall into the hands of the base
 hangman soldiers of this age, by whom they are tormented with all sorts of
 inhuman usage to compel them to some excessive and impossible ransom;
 kept, in the meantime, in such condition and place, where they have no
 means of expressing or signifying their thoughts and their misery. The
 poets have feigned some gods who favour the deliverance of such as suffer
 under a languishing death:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Hunc ego Diti
 Sacrum jussa fero, teque isto corpore solvo."

 ["I bidden offer this sacred thing to Pluto, and from that body
 dismiss thee."?AEneid, iv. 782.]
</pre>
 <p>
 both the interrupted words, and the short and irregular answers one gets
 from them sometimes, by bawling and keeping a clutter about them; or the
 motions which seem to yield some consent to what we would have them do,
 are no testimony, nevertheless, that they live, an entire life at least.
 So it happens to us in the yawning of sleep, before it has fully possessed
 us, to perceive, as in a dream, what is done about us, and to follow the
 last things that are said with a perplexed and uncertain hearing which
 seems but to touch upon the borders of the soul; and to make answers to
 the last words that have been spoken to us, which have more in them of
 chance than sense.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now seeing I have in effect tried it, I have no doubt but I have hitherto
 made a right judgment; for first, being in a swoon, I laboured to rip open
 the buttons of my doublet with my nails, for my sword was gone; and yet I
 felt nothing in my imagination that hurt me; for we have many motions in
 us that do not proceed from our direction;
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Semianimesque micant digiti, ferrumque retractant;"

 ["Half-dead fingers grope about, and grasp again the sword."
 ?AEneid, x. 396.]
</pre>
 <p>
 so falling people extend their arms before them by a natural impulse,
 which prompts our limbs to offices and motions without any commission from
 our reason.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Falciferos memorant currus abscindere membra . . .
 Ut tremere in terra videatur ab artubus id quod
 Decidit abscissum; cum mens tamen atque hominis vis
 Mobilitate mali, non quit sentire dolorem."

 ["They relate that scythe-bearing chariots mow off limbs, so that
 they quiver on the ground; and yet the mind of him from whom the
 limb is taken by the swiftness of the blow feels no pain."
 ?Lucretius, iii. 642.]
</pre>
 <p>
 My stomach was so oppressed with the coagulated blood, that my hands moved
 to that part, of their own voluntary motion, as they frequently do to the
 part that itches, without being directed by our will. There are several
 animals, and even men, in whom one may perceive the muscles to stir and
 tremble after they are dead. Every one experimentally knows that there are
 some members which grow stiff and flag without his leave. Now, those
 passions which only touch the outward bark of us, cannot be said to be
 ours: to make them so, there must be a concurrence of the whole man; and
 the pains which are felt by the hand or the foot while we are sleeping,
 are none of ours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I drew near my own house, where the alarm of my fall was already got
 before me, and my family were come out to meet me, with the hubbub usual
 in such cases, not only did I make some little answer to some questions
 which were asked me; but they moreover tell me, that I was sufficiently
 collected to order them to bring a horse to my wife whom on the road, I
 saw struggling and tiring herself which is hilly and rugged. This should
 seem to proceed from a soul its functions; but it was nothing so with me.
 I knew not what I said or did, and they were nothing but idle thoughts in
 the clouds, that were stirred up by the senses of the eyes and ears, and
 proceeded not from me. I knew not for all that, whence I came or whither I
 went, neither was I capable to weigh and consider what was said to me:
 these were light effects, that the senses produced of themselves as of
 custom; what the soul contributed was in a dream, lightly touched, licked
 and bedewed by the soft impression of the senses. Notwithstanding, my
 condition was, in truth, very easy and quiet; I had no affliction upon me,
 either for others or myself; it was an extreme languor and weakness,
 without any manner of pain. I saw my own house, but knew it not. When they
 had put me to bed I found an inexpressible sweetness in that repose; for I
 had been desperately tugged and lugged by those poor people who had taken
 the pains to carry me upon their arms a very great and a very rough way,
 and had in so doing all quite tired out themselves, twice or thrice one
 after another. They offered me several remedies, but I would take none,
 certainly believing that I was mortally wounded in the head. And, in
 earnest, it had been a very happy death, for the weakness of my
 understanding deprived me of the faculty of discerning, and that of my
 body of the sense of feeling; I was suffering myself to glide away so
 sweetly and after so soft and easy a manner, that I scarce find any other
 action less troublesome than that was. But when I came again to myself and
 to resume my faculties:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Ut tandem sensus convaluere mei,"

 ["When at length my lost senses again returned."
 ?Ovid, Trist., i. 3, 14.]
</pre>
 <p>
 which was two or three hours after, I felt myself on a sudden involved in
 terrible pain, having my limbs battered and ground with my fall, and was.
 so ill for two or three nights after, that I thought I was once more dying
 again, but a more painful death, having concluded myself as good as dead
 before, and to this hour am sensible of the bruises of that terrible
 shock. I will not here omit, that the last thing I could make them beat
 into my head, was the memory of this accident, and I had it over and over
 again repeated to me, whither I was going, from whence I came, and at what
 time of the day this mischance befell me, before I could comprehend it. As
 to the manner of my fall, that was concealed from me in favour to him who
 had been the occasion, and other flim-flams were invented. But a long time
 after, and the very next day that my memory began to return and to
 represent to me the state wherein I was, at the instant that I perceived
 this horse coming full drive upon me (for I had seen him at my heels, and
 gave myself for gone, but this thought had been so sudden, that fear had
 had no leisure to introduce itself) it seemed to me like a flash of
 lightning that had pierced my soul, and that I came from the other world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This long story of so light an accident would appear vain enough, were it
 not for the knowledge I have gained by it for my own use; for I do really
 find, that to get acquainted with death, needs no more but nearly to
 approach it. Every one, as Pliny says, is a good doctrine to himself,
 provided he be capable of discovering himself near at hand. Here, this is
 not my doctrine, 'tis my study; and is not the lesson of another, but my
 own; and if I communicate it, it ought not to be ill taken, for that which
 is of use to me, may also, peradventure, be useful to another. As to the
 rest, I spoil nothing, I make use of nothing but my own; and if I play the
 fool, 'tis at my own expense, and nobody else is concerned in't; for 'tis
 a folly that will die with me, and that no one is to inherit. We hear but
 of two or three of the ancients, who have beaten this path, and yet I
 cannot say if it was after this manner, knowing no more of them but their
 names. No one since has followed the track: 'tis a rugged road, more so
 than it seems, to follow a pace so rambling and uncertain, as that of the
 soul; to penetrate the dark profundities of its intricate internal
 windings; to choose and lay hold of so many little nimble motions; 'tis a
 new and extraordinary undertaking, and that withdraws us from the common
 and most recommended employments of the world. 'Tis now many years since
 that my thoughts have had no other aim and level than myself, and that I
 have only pried into and studied myself: or, if I study any other thing,
 'tis to apply it to or rather in myself. And yet I do not think it a
 fault, if, as others do by other much less profitable sciences, I
 communicate what I have learned in this, though I am not very well pleased
 with my own progress. There is no description so difficult, nor doubtless
 of so great utility, as that of a man's self: and withal, a man must curl
 his hair and set out and adjust himself, to appear in public: now I am
 perpetually tricking myself out, for I am eternally upon my own
 description. Custom has made all speaking of a man's self vicious, and
 positively interdicts it, in hatred to the boasting that seems inseparable
 from the testimony men give of themselves:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "In vitium ducit culpae fuga."

 ["The avoiding a mere fault often leads us into a greater."
 Or: "The escape from a fault leads into a vice"
 ?Horace, De Arte Poetics, verse 31.]
</pre>
 <p>
 Instead of blowing the child's nose, this is to take his nose off
 altogether. I think the remedy worse than the disease. But, allowing it to
 be true that it must of necessity be presumption to entertain people with
 discourses of one's self, I ought not, pursuing my general design, to
 forbear an action that publishes this infirmity of mine, nor conceal the
 fault which I not only practise but profess. Notwithstanding, to speak my
 thought freely, I think that the custom of condemning wine, because some
 people will be drunk, is itself to be condemned; a man cannot abuse
 anything but what is good in itself; and I believe that this rule has only
 regard to the popular vice. They are bits for calves, with which neither
 the saints whom we hear speak so highly of themselves, nor the
 philosophers, nor the divines will be curbed; neither will I, who am as
 little the one as the other, If they do not write of it expressly, at all
 events, when the occasions arise, they don't hesitate to put themselves on
 the public highway. Of what does Socrates treat more largely than of
 himself? To what does he more direct and address the discourses of his
 disciples, than to speak of themselves, not of the lesson in their book,
 but of the essence and motion of their souls? We confess ourselves
 religiously to God and our confessor; as our neighbours, do to all the
 people. But some will answer that we there speak nothing but accusation
 against ourselves; why then, we say all; for our very virtue itself is
 faulty and penetrable. My trade and art is to live; he that forbids me to
 speak according to my own sense, experience, and practice, may as well
 enjoin an architect not to speak of building according to his own
 knowledge, but according to that of his neighbour; according to the
 knowledge of another, and not according to his own. If it be vainglory for
 a man to publish his own virtues, why does not Cicero prefer the eloquence
 of Hortensius, and Hortensius that of Cicero? Peradventure they mean that
 I should give testimony of myself by works and effects, not barely by
 words. I chiefly paint my thoughts, a subject void of form and incapable
 of operative production; 'tis all that I can do to couch it in this airy
 body of the voice; the wisest and devoutest men have lived in the greatest
 care to avoid all apparent effects. Effects would more speak of fortune
 than of me; they manifest their own office and not mine, but uncertainly
 and by conjecture; patterns of some one particular virtue. I expose myself
 entire; 'tis a body where, at one view, the veins, muscles, and tendons
 are apparent, every of them in its proper place; here the effects of a
 cold; there of the heart beating, very dubiously. I do not write my own
 acts, but myself and my essence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I am of opinion that a man must be very cautious how he values himself,
 and equally conscientious to give a true report, be it better or worse,
 impartially. If I thought myself perfectly good and wise, I would rattle
 it out to some purpose. To speak less of one's self than what one really
 is is folly, not modesty; and to take that for current pay which is under
 a man's value is pusillanimity and cowardice, according to, Aristotle. No
 virtue assists itself with falsehood; truth is never matter of error. To
 speak more of one's self than is really true is not always mere
 presumption; 'tis, moreover, very often folly; to, be immeasurably pleased
 with what one is, and to fall into an indiscreet self-love, is in my
 opinion the substance of this vice. The most sovereign remedy to cure it,
 is to do quite contrary to what these people direct who, in forbidding men
 to speak of themselves, consequently, at the same time, interdict thinking
 of themselves too. Pride dwells in the thought; the tongue can have but a
 very little share in it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They fancy that to think of one's self is to be delighted with one's self;
 to frequent and converse with one's self, to be overindulgent; but this
 excess springs only in those who take but a superficial view of
 themselves, and dedicate their main inspection to their affairs; who call
 it mere reverie and idleness to occupy one's self with one's self, and the
 building one's self up a mere building of castles in the air; who look
 upon themselves as a third person only, a stranger. If any one be in
 rapture with his own knowledge, looking only on those below him, let him
 but turn his eye upward towards past ages, and his pride will be abated,
 when he shall there find so many thousand wits that trample him under
 foot. If he enter into a flattering presumption of his personal valour,
 let him but recollect the lives of Scipio, Epaminondas; so many armies, so
 many nations, that leave him so far behind them. No particular quality can
 make any man proud, that will at the same time put the many other weak and
 imperfect ones he has in the other scale, and the nothingness of human
 condition to make up the weight. Because Socrates had alone digested to
 purpose the precept of his god, "to know himself," and by that study
 arrived at the perfection of setting himself at nought, he only was
 reputed worthy the title of a sage. Whosoever shall so know himself, let
 him boldly speak it out.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII??OF RECOMPENSES OF HONOUR
 </h2>
 <p>
 They who write the life of Augustus Caesar,?[Suetonius, Life of
 Augustus, c. 25.]?observe this in his military discipline, that he
 was wonderfully liberal of gifts to men of merit, but that as to the true
 recompenses of honour he was as sparing; yet he himself had been gratified
 by his uncle with all the military recompenses before he had ever been in
 the field. It was a pretty invention, and received into most governments
 of the world, to institute certain vain and in themselves valueless
 distinctions to honour and recompense virtue, such as the crowns of
 laurel, oak, and myrtle, the particular fashion of some garment, the
 privilege to ride in a coach in the city, or at night with a torch, some
 peculiar place assigned in public assemblies, the prerogative of certain
 additional names and titles, certain distinctions in the bearing of coats
 of arms, and the like, the use of which, according to the several humours
 of nations, has been variously received, and yet continues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We in France, as also several of our neighbours, have orders of knighthood
 that are instituted only for this end. And 'tis, in earnest, a very good
 and profitable custom to find out an acknowledgment for the worth of rare
 and excellent men, and to satisfy them with rewards that are not at all
 chargeable either to prince or people. And that which has always been
 found by ancient experience, and which we have heretofore observed among
 ourselves, that men of quality have ever been more jealous of such
 recompenses than of those wherein there was gain and profit, is not
 without very good ground and reason. If with the reward, which ought to be
 simply a recompense of honour, they should mix other commodities and add
 riches, this mixture, instead of procuring an increase of estimation,
 would debase and abate it. The Order of St. Michael, which has been so
 long in repute amongst us, had no greater commodity than that it had no
 communication with any other commodity, which produced this effect, that
 formerly there was no office or title whatever to which the gentry
 pretended with so great desire and affection as they did to that; no
 quality that carried with it more respect and grandeur, valour and worth
 more willingly embracing and with greater ambition aspiring to a
 recompense purely its own, and rather glorious than profitable. For, in
 truth, other gifts have not so great a dignity of usage, by reason they
 are laid out upon all sorts of occasions; with money a man pays the wages
 of a servant, the diligence of a courier, dancing, vaulting, speaking, and
 the meanest offices we receive; nay, and reward vice with it too, as
 flattery, treachery, and pimping; and therefore 'tis no wonder if virtue
 less desires and less willingly receives this common sort of payment, than
 that which is proper and peculiar to her, throughout generous and noble.
 Augustus had reason to be more sparing of this than the other, insomuch
 that honour is a privilege which derives its principal essence from
 rarity; and so virtue itself:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Cui malus est nemo, quis bonus esse potest?"

 ["To whom no one is ill who can be good?"-Martial, xii. 82.]
</pre>
 <p>
 We do not intend it for a commendation when we say that such a one is
 careful in the education of his children, by reason it is a common act,
 how just and well done soever; no more than we commend a great tree, where
 the whole forest is the same. I do not think that any citizen of Sparta
 glorified himself much upon his valour, it being the universal virtue of
 the whole nation; and as little upon his fidelity and contempt of riches.
 There is no recompense becomes virtue, how great soever, that is once
 passed into a custom; and I know not withal whether we can ever call it
 great, being common.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Seeing, then, that these remunerations of honour have no other value and
 estimation but only this, that few people enjoy them, 'tis but to be
 liberal of them to bring them down to nothing. And though there should be
 now more men found than in former times worthy of our order, the
 estimation of it nevertheless should not be abated, nor the honour made
 cheap; and it may easily happen that more may merit it; for there is no
 virtue that so easily spreads as that of military valour. There is another
 virtue, true, perfect, and philosophical, of which I do not speak, and
 only make use of the word in our common acceptation, much greater than
 this and more full, which is a force and assurance of the soul, equally
 despising all sorts of adverse accidents, equable, uniform, and constant,
 of which ours is no more than one little ray. Use, education, example, and
 custom can do all in all to the establishment of that whereof I am
 speaking, and with great facility render it common, as by the experience
 of our civil wars is manifest enough; and whoever could at this time unite
 us all, Catholic and Huguenot, into one body, and set us upon some brave
 common enterprise, we should again make our ancient military reputation
 flourish. It is most certain that in times past the recompense of this
 order had not only a regard to valour, but had a further prospect; it
 never was the reward of a valiant soldier but of a great captain; the
 science of obeying was not reputed worthy of so honourable a guerdon.
 There was therein a more universal military expertness required, and that
 comprehended the most and the greatest qualities of a military man:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Neque enim eaedem militares et imperatorix artes sunt,"

 ["For the arts of soldiery and generalship are not the same."
 ?Livy, xxv. 19.]
</pre>
 <p>
 as also, besides, a condition suitable to such a dignity. But, I say,
 though more men were worthy than formerly, yet ought it not to be more
 liberally distributed, and it were better to fall short in not giving it
 at all to whom it should be due, than for ever to lose, as we have lately
 done, the fruit of so profitable an invention. No man of spirit will deign
 to advantage himself with what is in common with many; and such of the
 present time as have least merited this recompense themselves make the
 greater show of disdaining it, in order thereby to be ranked with those to
 whom so much wrong has been done by the unworthy conferring and debasing
 the distinction which was their particular right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, to expect that in obliterating and abolishing this, suddenly to
 create and bring into credit a like institution, is not a proper attempt
 for so licentious and so sick a time as this wherein we now are; and it
 will fall out that the last will from its birth incur the same
 inconveniences that have ruined the other.?[Montaigne refers to the
 Order of the Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henry III. in 1578.]?The
 rules for dispensing this new order had need to be extremely clipt and
 bound under great restrictions, to give it authority; and this tumultuous
 season is incapable of such a curb: besides that, before this can be
 brought into repute, 'tis necessary that the memory of the first, and of
 the contempt into which it is fallen, be buried in oblivion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This place might naturally enough admit of some discourse upon the
 consideration of valour, and the difference of this virtue from others;
 but, Plutarch having so often handled this subject, I should give myself
 an unnecessary trouble to repeat what he has said. But this is worth
 considering: that our nation places valour, vaillance, in the highest
 degree of virtue, as its very word evidences, being derived from valeur,
 and that, according to our use, when we say a man of high worth a good
 man, in our court style?'tis to say a valiant man, after the Roman
 way; for the general appellation of virtue with them takes etymology from
 vis, force. The proper, sole, and essential profession of, the French
 noblesse is that of arms: and 'tis likely that the first virtue that
 discovered itself amongst men and has given to some advantage over others,
 was that by which the strongest and most valiant have mastered the weaker,
 and acquired a particular authority and reputation, whence came to it that
 dignified appellation; or else, that these nations, being very warlike,
 gave the pre-eminence to that of the virtues which was most familiar to
 them; just as our passion and the feverish solicitude we have of the
 chastity of women occasions that to say, a good woman, a woman of worth, a
 woman of honour and virtue, signifies merely a chaste woman as if, to
 oblige them to that one duty, we were indifferent as to all the rest, and
 gave them the reins in all other faults whatever to compound for that one
 of incontinence.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VIII??OF THE AFFECTION OF FATHERS TO THEIR CHILDREN
 </h2>
 <h3>
 To Madame D'Estissac.
 </h3>
 <p>
 MADAM, if the strangeness and novelty of my subject, which are wont to
 give value to things, do not save me, I shall never come off with honour
 from this foolish attempt: but 'tis so fantastic, and carries a face so
 unlike the common use, that this, peradventure, may make it pass. 'Tis a
 melancholic humour, and consequently a humour very much an enemy to my
 natural complexion, engendered by the pensiveness of the solitude into
 which for some years past I have retired myself, that first put into my
 head this idle fancy of writing. Wherein, finding myself totally
 unprovided and empty of other matter, I presented myself to myself for
 argument and subject. 'Tis the only book in the world of its kind, and of
 a wild and extravagant design. There is nothing worth remark in this
 affair but that extravagancy: for in a subject so vain and frivolous, the
 best workman in the world could not have given it a form fit to recommend
 it to any manner of esteem.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, madam, having to draw my own picture to the life, I had omitted one
 important feature, had I not therein represented the honour I have ever
 had for you and your merits; which I have purposely chosen to say in the
 beginning of this chapter, by reason that amongst the many other excellent
 qualities you are mistress of, that of the tender love you have manifested
 to your children, is seated in one of the highest places. Whoever knows at
 what age Monsieur D'Estissac, your husband, left you a widow, the great
 and honourable matches that have since been offered to you, as many as to
 any lady of your condition in France, the constancy and steadiness
 wherewith, for so many years, you have sustained so many sharp
 difficulties, the burden and conduct of affairs, which have persecuted you
 in every corner of the kingdom, and are not yet weary of tormenting you,
 and the happy direction you have given to all these, by your sole prudence
 or good fortune, will easily conclude with me that we have not so vivid an
 example as yours of maternal affection in our times. I praise God, madam,
 that it has been so well employed; for the great hopes Monsieur
 D'Estissac, your son, gives of himself, render sufficient assurance that
 when he comes of age you will reap from him all the obedience and
 gratitude of a very good man. But, forasmuch as by reason of his tender
 years, he has not been capable of taking notice of those offices of
 extremest value he has in so great number received from you, I will, if
 these papers shall one day happen to fall into his hands, when I shall
 neither have mouth nor speech left to deliver it to him, that he shall
 receive from me a true account of those things, which shall be more
 effectually manifested to him by their own effects, by which he will
 understand that there is not a gentleman in France who stands more
 indebted to a mother's care; and that he cannot, in the future, give a
 better nor more certain testimony of his own worth and virtue than by
 acknowledging you for that excellent mother you are.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If there be any law truly natural, that is to say, any instinct that is
 seen universally and perpetually imprinted in both beasts and men (which
 is not without controversy), I can say, that in my opinion, next to the
 care every animal has of its own preservation, and to avoid that which may
 hurt him, the affection that the begetter bears to his offspring holds the
 second place in this rank. And seeing that nature appears to have
 recommended it to us, having regard to the extension and progression of
 the successive pieces of this machine of hers, 'tis no wonder if, on the
 contrary, that of children towards their parents is not so great. To which
 we may add this other Aristotelian consideration, that he who confers a
 benefit on any one, loves him better than he is beloved by him again: that
 he to whom is owing, loves better than he who owes; and that every
 artificer is fonder of his work, than, if that work had sense, it would be
 of him; by reason that it is dear to us to be, and to be consists in
 movement and action; therefore every one has in some sort a being in his
 work. He who confers a benefit exercises a fine and honest action; he who
 receives it exercises the useful only. Now the useful is much less lovable
 than the honest; the honest is stable and permanent, supplying him who has
 done it with a continual gratification. The useful loses itself, easily
 slides away, and the memory of it is neither so fresh nor so pleasing.
 Those things are dearest to us that have cost us most, and giving is more
 chargeable than receiving.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since it has pleased God to endue us with some capacity of reason, to the
 end we may not, like brutes, be servilely subject and enslaved to the laws
 common to both, but that we should by judgment and a voluntary liberty
 apply ourselves to them, we ought, indeed, something to yield to the
 simple authority of nature, but not suffer ourselves to be tyrannically
 hurried away and transported by her; reason alone should have the conduct
 of our inclinations. I, for my part, have a strange disgust for those
 propensions that are started in us without the mediation and direction of
 the judgment, as, upon the subject I am speaking of, I cannot entertain
 that passion of dandling and caressing infants scarcely born, having as
 yet neither motion of soul nor shape of body distinguishable, by which
 they can render themselves amiable, and have not willingly suffered them
 to be nursed near me. A true and regular affection ought to spring and
 increase with the knowledge they give us of themselves, and then, if they
 are worthy of it, the natural propension walking hand in hand with reason,
 to cherish them with a truly paternal love; and so to judge, also, if they
 be otherwise, still rendering ourselves to reason, notwithstanding the
 inclination of nature. 'Tis oft-times quite otherwise; and, most commonly,
 we find ourselves more taken with the running up and down, the games, and
 puerile simplicities of our children, than we do, afterwards, with their
 most complete ac
