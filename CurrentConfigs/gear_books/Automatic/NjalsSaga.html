<p id="id00013">There was a man named Mord whose surname was Fiddle; he was the
son of Sigvat the Red, and he dwelt at the "Vale" in the
Rangrivervales. He was a mighty chief, and a great taker up of
suits, and so great a lawyer that no judgments were thought
lawful unless he had a hand in them. He had an only daughter,
named Unna. She was a fair, courteous, and gifted woman, and
that was thought the best match in all the Rangrivervales.</p><br>

<p id="id00014">Now the story turns westward to the Broadfirth dales, where, at
Hauskuldstede, in Laxriverdale, dwelt a man named Hauskuld, who
was Dalakoll's son, and his mother's name was Thorgerda.(1) He
had a brother named Hrut, who dwelt at Hrutstede; he was of the
same mother as Hauskuld, but his father's name was Heriolf. Hrut
was handsome, tall and strong, well skilled in arms, and mild of
temper; he was one of the wisest of men ??? stern towards his
foes, but a good counsellor on great matters. It happened once
that Hauskuld bade his friends to a feast, and his brother Hrut
was there, and sat next him. Hauskuld had a daughter named
Hallgerda, who was playing on the floor with some other girls.
She was fair of face and tall of growth, and her hair was as soft
as silk; it was so long, too, that it came down to her waist.
Hauskuld called out to her, "Come hither to me, daughter." So
she went up to him, and he took her by the chin, and kissed her;
and after that she went away.</p><br>

<p id="id00015">Then Hauskuld said to Hrut, "What dost thou think of this maiden?
Is she not fair?" Hrut held his peace. Hauskuld said the same
thing to him a second time, and then Hrut answered, "Fair enough
is this maid, and many will smart for it, but this I know not,
whence thief's eyes have come into our race." Then Hauskuld was
wroth, and for a time the brothers saw little of each other.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00016" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id00017" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">(1) Thorgerda was daughter of Thorstein the Red who was Olaf the
 White's son, Ingialld's son, Helgi's son. Ingialld's mother
 was Thora, daughter of Sigurd Snake-i'-the-eye, who was
 Ragnar Hairybreek's son. And the Deeply-wealthy was
 Thorstein the Red's mother; she was daughter of Kettle
 Flatnose, who was Bjorn Boun's son, Grim's son, Lord of Sogn
 in Norway.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00018" style="margin-top: 3em">2. HRUT WOOS UNNA</h3>

<p id="id00019">It happened once that those brothers, Hauskuld and Hrut, rode to
the Althing, and there was much people at it. Then Hauskuld said
to Hrut, "One thing I wish, brother, and that is, that thou
wouldst better thy lot and woo thyself a wife."</p><br>

<p id="id00020">Hrut answered, "That has been long on my mind, though there
always seemed to be two sides to the matter; but now I will do as
thou wishest; whither shall we turn our eyes?"</p><br>

<p id="id00021">Hauskuld answered, "Here now are many chiefs at the Thing, and
there is plenty of choice, but I have already set my eyes on a
spot where a match lies made to thy hand. The woman's name is
Unna, and she is a daughter of Fiddle Mord, one of the wisest of
men. He is here at the Thing and his daughter too, and thou
mayest see her if it pleases thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00022">Now the next day, when men were going to the High Court, they saw
some well-dressed women standing outside the booths of the men
from the Rangrivervales. Then Hauskuld said to Hrut "Yonder now
is Unna, of whom I spoke; what thinkest thou of her?"</p><br>

<p id="id00023">"Well," answered Hrut; "but yet I do not know whether we should
get on well together."</p><br>

<p id="id00024">After that they went to the High Court, where Fiddle Mord was
laying down the law as was his wont, and after he had done he
went home to his booth.</p><br>

<p id="id00025">Then Hauskuld and Hrut rose, and went to Mord's booth. They went
in and found Mord sitting in the innermost part of the booth, and
they bade him "Good-day." He rose to meet them, and took
Hauskuld by the hand and made him sit down by his side, and Hrut
sat next to Hauskuld. So after they had talked much of this and
that, at last Hauskuld said, "I have a bargain to speak to thee
about; Hrut wishes to become thy son-in-law, and buy thy
daughter, and I, for my part, will not be sparing in the matter."</p><br>

<p id="id00026">Mord answered, "I know that thou art a great chief, but thy
brother is unknown to me."</p><br>

<p id="id00027">"He is a better man than I," answered Hauskuld.</p><br>

<p id="id00028">"Thou wilt need to lay down a large sum with him, for she is heir
to all I leave behind me," said Mord.</p><br>

<p id="id00029">"There is no need," said Hauskuld, "to wait long before thou
hearest what I give my word he shall have. He shall have
Kamness and Hrutstede, up as far as Thrandargil, and a trading-
ship beside, now on her voyage."</p><br>

<p id="id00030">Then said Hrut to Mord, "Bear in mind, now, husband, that my
brother has praised me much more than I deserve for love's sake;
but if after what thou hast heard, thou wilt make the match, I am
willing to let thee lay down the terms thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id00031">Mord answered, "I have thought over the terms; she shall have
sixty hundreds down, and this sum shall be increased by a third
more in thine house, but if ye two have heirs, ye shall go halves
in the goods."</p><br>

<p id="id00032">Then said Hrut, "I agree to these terms, and now let us take
witness." After that they stood up and shook hands, and Mord
betrothed his daughter Unna to Hrut, and the bridal feast was to
be at Mord's house, half a month after Midsummer.</p><br>

<p id="id00033">Now both sides ride home from the Thing, and Hauskuld and Hrut
ride westward by Hallbjorn's beacon. Then Thiostolf, the son of
Bjorn Gullbera of Reykriverdale, rode to meet them, and told them
how a ship had come out from Norway to the White River, and how
aboard of her was Auzur Hrut's father's brother, and he wished
Hrut to come to him as soon as ever he could. When Hrut heard
this, he asked Hauskuld to go with him to the ship, so Hauskuld
went with his brother, and when they reached the ship, Hrut gave
his kinsman Auzur a kind and hearty welcome. Auzur asked them
into his booth to drink, so their horses were unsaddled, and they
went in and drank, and while they were drinking, Hrut said to
Auzur, "Now, kinsman, thou must ride west with me, and stay with
me this winter."</p><br>

<p id="id00034">"That cannot be, kinsman, for I have to tell thee the death of
thy brother Eyvind, and he has left thee his heir at the Gula
Thing, and now thy foes will seize thy heritage, unless thou
comest to claim it."</p><br>

<p id="id00035">"What's to be done now, brother?" said Hrut to Hauskuld, "for
this seems a hard matter, coming just as I have fixed my bridal
day."</p><br>

<p id="id00036">"Thou must ride south," said Hauskuld, "and see Mord, and ask him
to change the bargain which ye two have made, and to let his
daughter sit for thee three winters as thy betrothed, but I will
ride home and bring down thy wares to the ship."</p><br>

<p id="id00037">Then said Hrut, "My wish is that thou shouldest take meal and
timber, and whatever else thou needest out of the lading." So
Hrut had his horses brought out, and he rode south, while
Hauskuld rode home west. Hrut came east to the Rangrivervales to
Mord, and had a good welcome, and he told Mord all his business,
and asked his advice what he should do.</p><br>

<p id="id00038">"How much money is this heritage," asked Mord, and Hrut said it
would come to a hundred marks, if he got it all.</p><br>

<p id="id00039">"Well," said Mord, "that is much when set against what I shall
leave behind me, and thou shalt go for it, if thou wilt."</p><br>

<p id="id00040">After that they broke their bargain, and Unna was to sit waiting
for Hrut three years as his betrothed. Now Hrut rides back to
the ship, and stays by her during the summer, till she was ready
to sail, and Hauskuld brought down all Hrut's wares and money to
the ship, and Hrut placed all his other property in Hauskuld's
hands to keep for him while he was away. Then Hauskuld rode home
to his house, and a little while after they got a fair wind and
sail away to sea. They were out three weeks, and the first land
they made was Hern, near Bergen, and so sail eastward to the Bay.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00041" style="margin-top: 3em">3. HRUT AND GUNNHILLDA, KING'S MOTHER</h3>

<p id="id00042">At that time Harold Grayfell reigned in Norway; he was the son of
Eric Bloodaxe, who was the son of Harold Fair-hair; his mother's
name was Gunnhillda, a daughter of Auzur Toti, and they had their
abode east, at the King's Crag. Now the news was spread, how a
ship had come thither east into the Bay, and as soon as
Gunnhillda heard of it, she asked what men from Iceland were
abroad, and they told her Hrut was the man's name, Auzur's
brother's son. Then Gunnhillda said, "I see plainly that he
means to claim his heritage, but there is a man named Soti, who
has laid his hands on it."</p><br>

<p id="id00043">After that she called her waiting-man, whose name was Augmund,
and said, "I am going to send thee to the Bay to find out Auzur
and Hrut, and tell them that I ask them both to spend this winter
with me. Say, too, that I will be their friend, and if Hrut will
carry out my counsel, I will see after his suit, and anything
else he takes in hand, and I will speak a good word, too, for him
to the king."</p><br>

<p id="id00044">After that he set off and found them; and as soon as they knew
that he was Gunnhillda's servant, they gave him good welcome. He
took them aside and told them his errand, and after that they
talked over their plans by themselves. Then Auzur said to Hrut,
"Methinks, kinsman, here is little need for long talk, our plans
are ready made for us; for I know Gunnhillda's temper; as soon as
ever we say we will not go to her she will drive us out of the
land, and take all our goods by force; but if we go to her, then
she will do us such honour as she has promised."</p><br>

<p id="id00045">Augmund went home, and when he saw Gunnhillda, he told her how
his errand had ended, and that they would come, and Gunnhillda
said, "It is only what was to be looked for; for Hrut is said to
be a wise and well-bred man; and now do thou keep a sharp look
out, and tell me as soon as ever they come to the town."</p><br>

<p id="id00046">Hrut and Auzur went east to the King's Crag, and when they
reached the town, their kinsmen and friends went out to meet and
welcome them. They asked whether the king were in the town, and
they told them he was. After that they met Augmund, and he
brought them a greeting from Gunnhillda, saying, that she could
not ask them to her house before they had seen the king, lest men
should say, "I make too much of them." Still she would do all
she could for them, and she went on, "Tell Hrut to be out-spoken
before the king, and to ask to be made one of his body-guard;"
"and here," said Augmund, "is a dress of honour which she sends
to thee, Hrut, and in it thou must go in before the king." After
that he went away.</p><br>

<p id="id00047">The next day Hrut said, "Let us go before the king."</p><br>

<p id="id00048">"That may well be," answered Auzur.</p><br>

<p id="id00049">So they went, twelve of them together, and all of them friends or
kinsmen, and came into the hall where the king sat over his
drink. Hrut went first and bade the king "Good-day," and the
king, looking steadfastly at the man who was well-dressed, asked
him his name. So he told his name.</p><br>

<p id="id00050">"Art thou an Icelander?" said the king.</p><br>

<p id="id00051">He answered, "Yes."</p><br>

<p id="id00052">"What drove thee hither to seek us?"</p><br>

<p id="id00053">Then Hrut answered, "To see your state, lord; and, besides,
because I have a great matter of inheritance here in the land,
and I shall have need of your help if I am to get my rights."</p><br>

<p id="id00054">The king said, "I have given my word that every man shall have
lawful justice here in Norway; but hast thou any other errand in
seeking me?"</p><br>

<p id="id00055">"Lord!" said Hrut, "I wish you to let me live in your court, and
become one of your men."</p><br>

<p id="id00056">At this the king holds his peace, but Gunnhillda said, "It seems
to me as if this man offered you the greatest honour, for
methinks if there were many such men in the body-guard, it would
be well filled."</p><br>

<p id="id00057">"Is he a wise man?" asked the king.</p><br>

<p id="id00058">"He is both wise and willing," said she.</p><br>

<p id="id00059">"Well," said the king, "methinks my mother wishes that thou
shouldst have the rank for which thou askest, but for the sake of
our honour and the custom of the land, come to me in half a
month's time, and then thou shalt be made one of my body-guard.
Meantime, my mother will take care of thee, but then come to me."</p><br>

<p id="id00060">Then Gunnhillda said to Augmund, "Follow them to my house, and
treat them well."</p><br>

<p id="id00061">So Augmund went out, and they went with him, and he brought them
to a hall built of stone, which was hung with the most beautiful
tapestry, and there too was Gunnhillda's high seat.</p><br>

<p id="id00062">Then Augmund said to Hrut, "Now will be proved the truth of all
that I said to thee from Gunnhillda. Here is her high seat, and
in it thou shalt sit, and this seat thou shalt hold, though she
comes herself into the hall."</p><br>

<p id="id00063">After that he made them good cheer, and they had sat down but a
little while when Gunnhillda came in. Hrut wished to jump up and
greet her.</p><br>

<p id="id00064">"Keep thy seat!" she says, "and keep it too all the time thou art
my guest."</p><br>

<p id="id00065">Then she sat herself down by Hrut, and they fell to drink, and at
even she said, "Thou shalt be in the upper chamber with me
to-night, and we two together."</p><br>

<p id="id00066">"You shall have your way," he answers.</p><br>

<p id="id00067">After that they went to sleep, and she locked the door inside.
So they slept that night, and in the morning fell to drinking
again. Thus they spent their life all that halfmonth, and
Gunnhillda said to the men who were there, "Ye shall lose nothing
except your lives if you say to any one a word of how Hrut and I
are going on."</p><br>

<p id="id00068">When the half-month was over Hrut gave her a hundred ells of
household woollen and twelve rough cloaks, and Gunnhillda thanked
him for his gifts. Then Hrut thanked her and gave her a kiss and
went away. She bade him "farewell." And next day he went before
the king with thirty men after him and bade the king "Good-day."
The king said, "Now, Hrut, thou wilt wish me to carry out towards
thee what I promised."</p><br>

<p id="id00069">So Hrut was made one of the king's body-guard, and he asked,<br>

"Where shall I sit?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00070">"My mother shall settle that," said the king.</p><br>

<p id="id00071">Then she got him a seat in the highest room, and he spent the
winter with the king in much honour.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00072" style="margin-top: 3em">4. OF HRUT'S CRUISE</h3>

<p id="id00073">When the spring came he asked about Soti, and found out he had
gone south to Denmark with the inheritance. Then Hrut went to
Gunnhillda and tells her what Soti had been about. Gunnhillda
said, "I will give thee two long-ships, full manned, and along
with them the bravest man, Wolf the Unwashed, our overseer of
guests; but still go and see the king before thou settest off."</p><br>

<p id="id00074">Hrut did so; and when he came before the king, then he told the
king of Soti's doings, and how he had a mind to hold on after
him.</p><br>

<p id="id00075">The king said, "What strength has my mother handed over to thee?"</p><br>

<p id="id00076">"Two long-ships and Wolf the Unwashed to lead the men," says<br>

Hrut.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00077">"Well given," says the king. "Now I will give thee other two
ships, and even then thou'lt need all the strength thou'st got."</p><br>

<p id="id00078">After that he went down with Hrut to the ship, and said, "fare
thee well." Then Hrut sailed away south with his crews.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00079" style="margin-top: 3em">5. ATLI ARNVID SON'S SLAYING</h3>

<p id="id00080">There was a man named Atli, son of Arnvid, Earl of East Gothland.<br>

He had kept back the taxes from Hacon Athelstane's foster child,<br>

and both father and son had fled away from Jemtland to Gothland.<br>

After that, Atli held on with his followers out of the Maelar by<br>

Stock Sound, and so on towards Denmark, and now he lies out in<br>

Oresound.(1) He is an outlaw both of the Dane-King and of the<br>

Swede-King. Hrut held on south to the Sound, and when he came<br>

into it he saw a many ships in the Sound. Then Wolf said,<br>

"What's best to be done now, Icelander?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00081">"Hold on our course," said Hrut, "for `nothing venture, nothing
have.' My ship and Auzur's shall go first, but thou shalt lay
thy ship where thou likest."</p><br>

<p id="id00082">"Seldom have I had others as a shield before me," says Wolf, and
lays his galley side by side with Hrut's ship; and so they hold
on through the Sound. Now those who are in the Sound see that
ships are coming up to them, and they tell Atli.</p><br>

<p id="id00083">He answered, "Then may be there'll be gain to be got."</p><br>

<p id="id00084">After that men took their stand on board each ship; "but my
ship," says Atli, "shall be in the midst of the fleet."</p><br>

<p id="id00085">Meantime Hrut's ships ran on, and as soon as either side could
hear the other's hail, Atli stood up and said, "Ye fare unwarily.
Saw ye not that war-ships were in the Sound. But what's the name
of your chief?"</p><br>

<p id="id00086">Hrut tells his name.</p><br>

<p id="id00087">"Whose man art thou," says Atli.</p><br>

<p id="id00088">"One of king Harold Grayfell's body-guard."</p><br>

<p id="id00089">Atli said. "'Tis long since any love was lost between us, father
and son, and your Norway kings."</p><br>

<p id="id00090">"Worse luck for thee," says Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00091">"Well," says Atli, "the upshot of our meeting will be, that thou
shalt not be left alive to tell the tale;" and with that he
caught up a spear and hurled it at Hrut's ship, and the man who
stood before it got his death. After that the battle began, and
they were slow in boarding Hrut's ship. Wolf, he went well
forward, and with him it was now cut, now thrust. Atli's
bowman's name was Asolf; he sprung up on Hrut's ship, and was
four men's death before Hrut was aware of him; then he turned
against him, and when they met, Asolf thrust at and through
Hrut's shield, but Hrut cut once at Asolf, and that was his
death-blow. Wolf the Unwashed saw that stroke, and called out,
"Truth to say, Hrut, thou dealest big blows, but thou'st much to
thank Gunnhillda for."</p><br>

<p id="id00092">"Something tells me," says Hrut, "that thou speakest with a `fey'
mouth."</p><br>

<p id="id00093">Now Atli sees a bare place for a weapon on Wolf, and shot a spear
through him and now the battle grows hot: Atli leaps up on Hrut's
ship, and clears it fast round about, and now Auzur turns to meet
him, and thrust at him, but fell down full length on his back,
for another man thrust at him. Now Hrut turns to meet Atli: he
cut at once at Hrut's shield, and clove it all in two, from top
to point; just then Atli got a blow on his hand from a stone, and
down fell his sword. Hrut caught up the sword, and cut his foot
from under him. After that he dealt him his death-blow. There
they took much goods, and brought away with them two ships which
were best, and stayed there only a little while. But meantime
Soti and his crew had sailed past them, and he held on his course
back to Norway, and made the land at Limgard's side. There Soti
went on shore, and there he met Augmund, Gunnhillda's page; he
knew him at once, and asks, "How long meanest thou to be here?"</p><br>

<p id="id00094">"Three nights," says Soti.</p><br>

<p id="id00095">"Whither away, then?" says Augmund.</p><br>

<p id="id00096">"West, to England," says Soti, "and never to come back again to<br>

Norway while Gunnhillda's rule is in Norway."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00097">Augmund went away, and goes and finds Gunnhillda, for she was a
little way off, at a feast, and Gudred, her son, with her.
Augmund told Gunnhillda what Soti meant to do, and she begged
Gudred to take his life. So Gudred set off at once, and came
unawares on Soti, and made them lead him up the country, and hang
him there. But the goods he took, and brought them to his
mother, and she got men to carry them all down to the King's
Crag, and after that she went thither herself.</p><br>

<p id="id00098">Hrut came back towards autumn, and had gotten great store of
goods. He went at once to the king, and had a hearty welcome.
He begged them to take whatever they pleased of his goods, and
the king took a third. Gunnhillda told Hrut how she had got hold
of the inheritance, and had Soti slain. He thanked her, and gave
her half of all he had.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00101" style="margin-top: 3em">6. HRUT SAILS OUT TO ICELAND</h3>

<p id="id00102">Hrut stayed with the king that winter in good cheer, but when
spring came he grew very silent. Gunnhillda finds that out, and
said to him when they two were alone together, "Art thou sick at
heart?"</p><br>

<p id="id00103">"So it is," said Hrut, "as the saying runs ??? `Ill goes it with
those who are born on a barren land.'"</p><br>

<p id="id00104">"Wilt thou to Iceland?" she asks.</p><br>

<p id="id00105">"Yes," he answered.</p><br>

<p id="id00106">"Hast thou a wife out there?" she asked; and he answers, "No."</p><br>

<p id="id00107">"But I am sure that is true," she says; and so they ceased
talking about the matter.</p><br>

<p id="id00108">Shortly after Hrut went before the king and bade him Good-day;
and the king said, "What dost thou want now, Hrut?"</p><br>

<p id="id00109">"I am come to ask, lord, that you give me leave to go to<br>

Iceland."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00110">"Will thine honour be greater there than here?" asks the king.</p><br>

<p id="id00111">"No, it will not," said Hrut; "but every one must win the work
that is set before him."</p><br>

<p id="id00112">"It is pulling a rope against a strong man," said Gunnhillda, "so
give him leave to go as best suits him."</p><br>

<p id="id00113">There was a bad harvest that year in the land, yet Gunnhillda
gave Hrut as much meal as he chose to have; and now he busks him
to sail out to Iceland, and Auzur with him; and when they were
"all-boun," Hrut went to find the king and Gunnhillda. She led
him aside to talk alone, and said to him, "Here is a gold ring
which I will give thee;" and with that she clasped it round his
wrist.</p><br>

<p id="id00114">"Many good gifts have I had from thee," said Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00115">Then she put her hands round his neck and kissed him, and said,
"If I have as much power over thee as I think, I lay this spell
on thee that thou mayst never have any pleasure in living with
that woman on whom thy heart is set in Iceland, but with other
women thou mayst get on well enough, and now it is like to go
well with neither of us; but thou hast not believed what I have
been saying."</p><br>

<p id="id00116">Hrut laughed when he heard that, and went away; after that he
came before the king and thanked him; and the king spoke kindly
to him, and bade him "farewell." Hrut went straight to his ship,
and they had a fair wind all the way until they ran into
Borgarfirth.</p><br>

<p id="id00117">As soon as the ship was made fast to the land, Hrut rode west
home, but Auzur stayed by the ship to unload her and lay her up.
Hrut rode straight to Hauskuldstede, and Hauskuld gave him a
hearty welcome, and Hrut told him all about his travels. After
that they send men east across the rivers to tell Fiddle Mord to
make ready for the bridal feast; but the two brothers rode to the
ship, and on the way Hauskuld told Hrut how his money-matters
stood, and his goods had gained much since he was away. Then
Hrut said, "The reward is less worth than it ought to be, but I
will give thee as much meal as thou needst for thy household next
winter."</p><br>

<p id="id00118">Then they drew the ship on land on rollers, and made her snug in
her shed, but all the wares on board her they carried away into
the Dales westward. Hrut stayed at home at Hrutstede till winter
was six weeks off, and then the brothers made ready and Auzur
with them, to ride to Hrut's wedding. Sixty men ride with them,
and they rode east till they came to Rangriver plains. There
they found a crowd of guests, and the men took their seats on
benches down the length of the hall, but the women were seated on
the cross-benches on the dais, and the bride was rather downcast.
So they drank out the feast and it went off well. Mord pays down
his daughter's portion, and she rides west with her husband and
his train. So they ride till they reach home. Hrut gave over
everything into her hands inside the house, and all were pleased
at that; but for all that she and Hrut did not pull well together
as man and wife, and so things went on till spring, and when
spring came Hrut had a journey to make to the Westfirths, to get
in the money for which he had sold his wares; but before he set
off his wife says to him, "Dost thou mean to be back before men
ride to the Thing?"</p><br>

<p id="id00119">"Why dost thou ask?" said Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00120">"I will ride to the Thing," she said, "to meet my father."</p><br>

<p id="id00121">"So it shall be," said he, "and I will ride to the Thing along
with thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00122">"Well and good," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00123">After that Hrut rode from home west to the Firths, got in all his
money, and laid it out anew, and rode home again. When he came
home he busked him to ride to the Thing, and made all his
neighbours ride with him. His brother Hauskuld rode among the
rest. Then Hrut said to his wife, "If thou hast as much mind now
to go to the Thing as thou saidst a while ago, busk thyself and
ride along with me."</p><br>

<p id="id00124">She was not slow in getting herself ready, and then they all
rode to the Thing. Unna went to her father's booth, and he gave
her a hearty welcome, but she seemed somewhat heavy-hearted, and
when he saw that he said to her, "I have seen thee with a merrier
face. Hast thou anything on thy mind?"</p><br>

<p id="id00125">She began to weep, and answered nothing. Then he said to her
again. "Why didst thou ride to the Thing, if thou wilt not tell
me thy secret? Dost thou dislike living away there in the west?"</p><br>

<p id="id00126">Then she answered him, "I would give all I own in the world that<br>

I had never gone thither."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00127">"Well!" said Mord, "I'll soon get to the bottom of this." Then
he sends men to fetch Hauskuld and Hrut, and they came
straightway; and when they came in to see Mord, he rose up to
meet them and gave them a hearty welcome, and asked them to sit
down. Then they talked a long time in a friendly way, and at
last Mord said to Hauskuld, "Why does my daughter think so ill of
life in the west yonder?"</p><br>

<p id="id00128">"Let her speak out," said Hrut, "if she has anything to lay to my
charge."</p><br>

<p id="id00129">But she brought no charge against him. Then Hrut made them ask
his neighbours and household how he treated her, and all bore him
good witness, saying that she did just as she pleased in the
house.</p><br>

<p id="id00130">Then Mord said, "Home thou shalt go, and be content with thy lot;
for all the witness goes better for him than for thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00131">After that Hrut rode home from the Thing, and his wife with him,
and all went smoothly between them that summer; but when spring
came it was the old story over again, and things grew worse and
worse as the spring went on. Hrut had again a journey to make
west to the Firths, and gave out that he would not ride to the
Althing, but Unna his wife said little about it. So Hrut went
away west to the Firths.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00132" style="margin-top: 3em">7. UNNA SEPARATES FROM HRUT</h3>

<p id="id00133">Now the time for the Thing was coming on. Unna spoke to Sigmund,
Auzur's son, and asked if he would ride to the Thing with her; he
said he could not ride if his kinsman Hrut set his face against
it.</p><br>

<p id="id00134">"Well!" says she, "I spoke to thee because I have better right to
ask this from thee than from any one else."</p><br>

<p id="id00135">He answered, "I will make a bargain with thee: thou must promise
to ride back west with me, and to have no underhand dealings
against Hrut or myself."</p><br>

<p id="id00136">So she promised that, and then they rode to the Thing. Her
father Mord was at the Thing, and was very glad to see her, and
asked her to stay in his booth while the Thing lasted, and she
did so.</p><br>

<p id="id00137">"Now," said Mord, "what hast thou to tell me of thy mate, Hrut?"</p><br>

<p id="id00138">Then she sung him a song, in which she praised Hrut's liberality,
but said he was not master of himself. She herself was ashamed
to speak out.</p><br>

<p id="id00139">Mord was silent a short time, and then said, "Thou hast now that
on thy mind I see, daughter, which thou dost not wish that any
one should know save myself, and thou wilt trust to me rather
than any one else to help thee out of thy trouble."</p><br>

<p id="id00140">Then they went aside to talk, to a place where none could
overhear what they said; and then Mord said to his daughter,
"Now, tell me all that is between you two, and don't make more of
the matter than it is worth."</p><br>

<p id="id00141">"So it shall be," she answered, and sang two songs, in which she
revealed the cause of their misunderstanding; and when Mord
pressed her to speak out, she told him how she and Hrut could not
live together, because he was spellbound, and that she wished to
leave him.</p><br>

<p id="id00142">"Thou didst right to tell me all this," said Mord, "and now I
will give thee a piece of advice, which will stand thee in good
stead, if thou canst carry it out to the letter. First of all,
thou must ride home from the Thing, and by that time thy husband
will have come back, and will be glad to see thee; thou must be
blithe and buxom to him, and he will think a good change has come
over thee, and thou must show no signs of coldness or ill-temper,
but when spring comes thou must sham sickness, and take to thy
bed. Hrut will not lose time in guessing what thy sickness can
be, nor will he scold thee at all, but he will rather beg every
one to take all the care they can of thee. After that he will
set off west to the Firths, and Sigmund with him, for he will
have to flit all his goods home from the Firths west, and he will
be away till the summer is far spent. But when men ride to the
Thing, and after all have ridden from the Dales that mean to ride
thither; then thou must rise from thy bed and summon men to go
along with thee to the Thing; and when thou art 'all-boun,' then
shalt thou go to thy bed, and the men with thee who are to bear
thee company, and thou shalt take witness before thy husband's
bed, and declare thyself separated from him by such a lawful
separation as may hold good according to the judgment of the
Great Thing, and the laws of the land; and at the man's door the
main door of the house, thou shalt take the same witness. After
that ride away, and ride over Laxriverdale Heath, and so on over
Holtbeacon Heath; for they will look for thee by way of
Hrutfirth. And so ride on till thou comest to me; then I will
see after the matter. But into his hands thou shalt never come
more."</p><br>

<p id="id00143">Now she rides home from the Thing, and Hrut had come back before
her, and made her hearty welcome. She answered him kindly, and
was blithe and forbearing towards him. So they lived happily
together that half-year; but when spring came she fell sick, and
kept her bed. Hrut set off west to the Firths, and bade them
tend her well before he went. Now, when the time for the Thing
comes, she busked herself to ride away, and did in every way as
had been laid down for her; and then she rides away to the Thing.
The country folk looked for her, but could not find her. Mord
made his daughter welcome, and asked her if she had followed his
advice; and she says, "I have not broken one tittle of it."</p><br>

<p id="id00144">Then she went to the Hill of Laws, and declared herself separated
from Hrut; and men thought this strange news. Unna went home
with her father, and never went west from that day forward.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00145" style="margin-top: 3em">8. MORD CLAIMS HIS GOODS FROM HRUT</h3>

<p id="id00146">Hrut came home, and knit his brows when he heard his wife was
gone, but yet kept his feelings well in hand, and stayed at home
all that half-year, and spoke to no one on the matter. Next
summer he rode to the Thing, with his brother Hauskuld, and they
had a great fellowing. But when he came to the Thing, he asked
whether Fiddle Mord were at the Thing, and they told him he was;
and all thought they would come to words at once about their
matter, but it was not so. At last, one day when the brothers
and others who were at the Thing went to the Hill of Laws, Mord
took witness and declared that he had a money-suit against Hrut
for his daughter's dower, and reckoned the amount at ninety
hundreds in goods, calling on Hrut at the same time to pay and
hand it over to him, and asking for a fine of three marks. He
laid the suit in the Quarter Court, into which it would come by
law, and gave lawful notice, so that all who stood on the Hill of
Laws might hear.</p><br>

<p id="id00147">But when he had thus spoken, Hrut said, "Thou hast undertaken
this suit, which belongs to thy daughter, rather for the greed of
gain and love of strife than in kindliness and manliness. But I
shall have something to say against it; for the goods which
belong to me are not yet in thy hands. Now, what I have to say
is this, and I say it out, so that all who hear me on this hill
may bear witness: I challenge thee to fight on the island; there
on one side shall be laid all thy daughter's dower, and on the
other I will lay down goods worth as much, and whoever wins the
day shall have both dower and goods; but if thou wilt not fight
with me, then thou shalt give up all claim to these goods."</p><br>

<p id="id00148">Then Mord held his peace, and took counsel with his friends about
going to fight on the island, and Jorund the priest gave him an
answer.</p><br>

<p id="id00149">"There is no need for thee to come to ask us for counsel in this
matter, for thou knowest if thou fightest with Hrut thou wilt
lose both life and goods. He has a good cause, and is besides
mighty in himself and one of the boldest of men."</p><br>

<p id="id00150">Then Mord spoke out, that he would not fight with Hrut, and there
arose a great shout and hooting on the hill, and Mord got the
greatest shame by his suit.</p><br>

<p id="id00151">After that men ride home from the Thing, and those brothers
Hauskuld and Hrut ride west to Reykriverdale, and turned in as
guests at Lund, where Thiostolf, Bjorn Gullbera's son, then
dwelt. There had been much rain that day, and men got wet, so
long-fires were made down the length of the hall. Thiostolf, the
master of the house, sat between Hauskuld and Hrut, and two boys,
of whom Thiostolf had the rearing, were playing on the floor, and
a girl was playing with them. They were great chatterboxes, for
they were too young to know better. So one of them said, "Now I
will be Mord, and summon thee to lose thy wife because thou hast
not been a good husband to her."</p><br>

<p id="id00152">Then the other answered, "I will be Hrut, and I call on thee to
give up all claim to thy goods, if thou darest not to fight with
me."</p><br>

<p id="id00153">This they said several times, and all the household burst out
laughing. Then Hauskuld got wroth, and struck the boy who called
himself Mord with a switch, and the blow fell on his face, and
grazed the skin.</p><br>

<p id="id00154">"Get out with thee," said Hauskuld to the boy, "and make no game
of us;" but Hrut said, "Come hitherto me," and the boy did so.
Then Hrut drew a ring from his finger and gave it to him, and
said, "Go away, and try no man's temper henceforth."</p><br>

<p id="id00155">Then the boy went away saying, "Thy manliness I will bear in mind
all my life."</p><br>

<p id="id00156">From this matter Hrut got great praise, and after that they went
home; and that was the end of Mord's and Hrut's quarrel,</p><br>

<h3 id="id00157" style="margin-top: 3em">9. THORWALD GETS HALLGERDA TO WIFE</h3>

<p id="id00158">Now, it must be told how Hallgerda, Hauskuld's daughter, grows
up, and is the fairest of women to look on; she was tall of
stature, too, and therefore she was called "Longcoat." She was
fair-haired, and had so much of it that she could hide herself in
it; but she was layish and hard-hearted. Her foster-father's
name was Thiostolf: he was a Southislander (1) by stock: he was a
strong man, well skilled in arms, and had slain many men, and
made no atonement in money for one of them. It was said, too,
that his rearing had not bettered Hallgerda's temper.</p><br>

<p id="id00159">There was a man named Thorwald; he was Oswif's son, and dwelt out
on Middlefells strand, under the Fell. He was rich and well to
do, and owned the islands called Bearisles, which lie out in
Broadfirth, whence he got meal and stock fish. This Thorwald was
a strong and courteous man, though somewhat hasty in temper.
Now, it fell out one day that Thorwald and his father were
talking together of Thorwald's marrying, and where he had best
look for a wife, and it soon came out that he thought there
wasn't a match fit for him far or near.</p><br>

<p id="id00160">"Well," said Oswif, "wilt thou ask for Hallgerda Longcoat,<br>

Hauskuld's daughter."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00161">"Yes! I will ask for her," said Thorwald.</p><br>

<p id="id00162">"But that is not a match that will suit either of you," Oswif
went on to say, "for she has a will of her own, and thou art
stern-tempered and unyielding."</p><br>

<p id="id00163">"For all that I will try my luck there," said Thorwald, "so it's
no good trying to hinder me."</p><br>

<p id="id00164">"Ay!" said Oswif, "and the risk is all thine own."</p><br>

<p id="id00165">After that they set off on a wooing journey to Hauskuldstede, and
had a hearty welcome. They were not long in telling Hauskuld
their business, and began to woo; then Hauskuld answered, "As for
you, I know how you both stand in the world, but for my own part
I will use no guile towards you. My daughter has a hard temper,
but as to her looks and breeding you can both see for
yourselves."</p><br>

<p id="id00166">"Lay down the terms of the match," answered Thorwald, "for I will
not let her temper stand in the way of our bargain."</p><br>

<p id="id00167">Then they talked over the terms of the bargain, and Hauskuld
never asked his daughter what she thought of it, for his heart
was set on giving her away and so they came to an understanding
as to the terms of the match. After that Thorwald betrothed
himself to Hallgerda, and rode away home when the matter was
settled.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00168" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id00169" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">(1) That is, he came from what we call the Western Isles or
 Hebrides. The old appellation still lingers in "Sodor (i.e.
 the South Isles) and Man."</p><br>

<h3 id="id00170" style="margin-top: 3em">10. HALLGERDA'S WEDDING</h3>

<p id="id00171">Hauskuld told Hallgerda of the bargain he had made, and she said,
"Now that has been put to the proof which I have all along been
afraid of, that thou lovest me not so much as thou art always
saying, when thou hast not thought it worth while to tell me a
word of all this matter. Besides, I do not think this match so
good a one as thou hast always promised me."</p><br>

<p id="id00172">So she went on, and let them know in every way that she thought
she was thrown away.</p><br>

<p id="id00173">Then Hauskuld said, "I do not set so much store by thy pride as
to let it stand in the way of my bargains; and my will, not
thine, shall carry the day if we fall out on any point."</p><br>

<p id="id00174">"The pride of all you kinsfolk is great," she said, "and so it is
not wonderful if I have some of it."</p><br>

<p id="id00175">With that she went away, and found her foster-father Thiostolf,
and told him what was in store for her, and was very heavy-
hearted. Then Thiostolf said, "Be of good cheer, for thou wilt
be married a second time, and then they will ask thee what thou
thinkest of the match; for I will do in all things as thou
wishest, except in what touches thy father or Hrut."</p><br>

<p id="id00176">After that they spoke no more of the matter, and Hauskuld made
ready the bridal feast, and rode off to ask men to it. So he
came to Hrutstede and called Hrut out to speak with him. Hrut
went out, and they began to talk, and Hauskuld told him the whole
story of the bargain, and bade him to the feast, saying, "I
should be glad to know that thou dost not feel hurt though I did
not tell thee when the bargain was being made."</p><br>

<p id="id00177">"I should be better pleased," said Hrut "to have nothing at all
to do with it; for this match will bring luck neither to him nor
to her; but still I will come to the feast if thou thinkest it
will add any honour to thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00178">"Of course I think so," said Hauskuld, and rode off home.</p><br>

<p id="id00179">Oswif and Thorwald also asked men to come, so that no fewer than
one hundred guests were asked.</p><br>

<p id="id00180">There was a man named Swan, who dwelt in Bearfirth, which lies
north from Steingrimsfirth. This Swan was a great wizard, and he
was Hallgerda's mother's brother. He was quarrelsome, and hard
to deal with, but Hallgerda asked him to the feast, and sends
Thiostolf to him; so he went, and it soon got to friendship
between him and Swan.</p><br>

<p id="id00181">Now men come to the feast, and Hallgerda sat upon the cross-
bench, and she was a very merry bride. Thiostolf was always
talking to her, though he sometimes found time to speak to Swan,
and men thought their talking strange. The feast went off well,
and Hauskuld paid down Hallgerda's portion with the greatest
readiness. After he had done that, he said to Hrut, "Shall I
bring out any gifts beside?"</p><br>

<p id="id00182">"The day will come," answered Hrut, "when thou wilt have to waste
thy goods for Hallgerda's sake, so hold thy hand now."</p><br>

<h3 id="id00183" style="margin-top: 3em">11. THORWALD'S SLAYING</h3>

<p id="id00184">Thorwald rode home from the bridal feast, and his wife with him,
and Thiostolf, who rode by her horse's side, and still talked to
her in a low voice. Oswif turned to his son and said, "Art thou
pleased with thy match? and how went it when ye talked
together."</p><br>

<p id="id00185">"Well," said he, "she showed all kindness to me. Thou mightst
see that by the way she laughs at every word I say."</p><br>

<p id="id00186">"I don't think her laughter so hearty as thou dost," answered<br>

Oswif, "but this will be put to the proof by and by."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00187">So they ride on till they come home, and at night she took her
seat by her husband's side, and made room for Thiostolf next
herself on the inside. Thiostolf and Thorwald had little to do
with each other, and few words were thrown away between them that
winter, and so time went on. Hallgerda was prodigal and
grasping, and there was nothing that any of their neighbours had
that she must not have too, and all that she had, no matter
whether it were her own or belonged to others she wasted. But
when the spring came there was a scarcity in the house, both of
meal and stock fish, so Hallgerda went up to Thorwald and said,
"Thou must not be sitting in-doors any longer, for we want for
the house both meal and fish."</p><br>

<p id="id00188">"Well," said Thorwald, "I did not lay in less for the house this
year than I laid in before, and then it used to last till
summer."</p><br>

<p id="id00189">"What care I," said Hallgerda, "if thou and thy father have made
your money by starving yourselves."</p><br>

<p id="id00190">Then Thorwald got angry and gave her a blow on the face and drew
blood, and went away and called his men and ran the skiff down to
the shore. Then six of them jumped into her and rowed out to the
Bear-isles, and began to load her with meal and fish.</p><br>

<p id="id00191">Meantime it is said that Hallgerda sat out of doors heavy at
heart. Thiostolf went up to her and saw the wound on her face,
and said, "Who has been playing thee this sorry trick?"</p><br>

<p id="id00192">"My husband, Thorwald," she said, "and thou stoodst aloof, though
thou wouldst not if thou hadst cared at all for me."</p><br>

<p id="id00193">"Because I knew nothing about it," said Thiostolf, "but I will
avenge it."</p><br>

<p id="id00194">Then he went away down to the shore and ran out a six-oared boat,
and held in his hand a great axe that he had with a haft overlaid
with iron. He steps into the boat and rows out to the
Bear-isles, and when he got there all the men had rowed away but
Thorwald and his followers, and he stayed by the skiff to load
her, while they brought the goods down to him. So Thiostolf came
up just then and jumped into the skiff, and began to load with
him, and after a while he said, "Thou canst do but little at this
work, and that little thou dost badly."</p><br>

<p id="id00195">"Thinkst thou thou canst do it better," said Thorwald.</p><br>

<p id="id00196">"There's one thing to be done which I can do better than thou,"
said Thiostolf, and then he went on, "The woman who is thy wife
has made a bad match, and you shall not live much longer
together."</p><br>

<p id="id00197">Then Thorwald snatched up a fishing-knife that lay by him, and
made a stab at Thiostolf; he had lifted his axe to his shoulder
and dashed it down. It came on Thorwald's arm and crushed the
wrist, but down fell the knife. Then Thiostolf lifted up his axe
a second time and gave Thorwald a blow on the head, and he fell
dead on the spot.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00198" style="margin-top: 3em">12. THIOSTOLF'S FLIGHT</h3>

<p id="id00199">While this was going on, Thorwald's men came down with their
load, but Thiostolf was not slow in his plans. He hewed with
both hands at the gunwale of the skiff and cut it down about two
planks; then he leapt into his boat, but the dark blue sea poured
into the skiff, and down she went with all her freight. Down too
sank Thorwald's body, so that his men could not see what had been
done to him, but they knew well enough that he was dead.
Thiostolf rowed away up the firth, but they shouted after him
wishing him ill luck. He made them no answer, but rowed on till
he got home, and ran the boat up on the beach, and went up to the
house with his axe, all bloody as it was, on his shoulder.
Hallgerda stood out of doors, and said, "Thine axe is bloody;
what hast thou done?"</p><br>

<p id="id00200">"I have done now what will cause thee to be wedded a second
time."</p><br>

<p id="id00201">"Thou tellest me then that Thorwald is dead," she said.</p><br>

<p id="id00202">"So it is," said he, "and now look out for my safety."</p><br>

<p id="id00203">"So I will," she said; "I will send thee north to Bearfirth, to<br>

Swanshol, and Swan, my kinsman, will receive thee with open arms.<br>

He is so mighty a man that no one will seek thee thither."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00204">So he saddled a horse that she had, and jumped on his back, and
rode off north to Bearfirth, to Swanshol, and Swan received him
with open arms, and said: "That's what I call a man who does not
stick at trifles! And now I promise thee if they seek thee here,
they shall get nothing but the greatest shame."</p><br>

<p id="id00205">Now, the story goes back to Hallgerda, and how she behaved. She
called on Liot the Black, her kinsman, to go with her, and bade
him saddle their horses, for she said, "I will ride home to my
father."</p><br>

<p id="id00206">While he made ready for their journey, she went to her chests and
unlocked them and called all the men of her house about her, and
gave each of them some gift; but they all grieved at her going.
Now she rides home to her father; and he received her well, for
as yet he had not heard the news. But Hrut said to Hallgerda,
"Why did not Thorwald come with thee?" and she answered, "He is
dead."</p><br>

<p id="id00207">Then said Hauskuld, "That was Thiostolf's doing."</p><br>

<p id="id00208">"It was," she said.</p><br>

<p id="id00209">"Ah!" said Hauskuld, "Hrut was not far wrong when he told me that
this bargain would draw mickle misfortune after it. But there's
no good in troubling one's self about a thing that's done and
gone."</p><br>

<p id="id00210">Now, the story must go back to Thorwald's mates, how there they
are, and how they begged the loan of a boat to get to the
mainland. So a boat was lent them at once, and they rowed up the
firth to Reykianess, and found Oswif, and told him these tidings.</p><br>

<p id="id00211">He said, "Ill luck is the end of ill redes, and now I see how it
has all gone. Hallgerda must have sent Thiostolf to Bearfirth,
but she herself must have ridden home to her father. Let us now
gather folk and follow him up thither north." So they did that,
and went about asking for help, and got together many men. And
then they all rode off to Steingrims river, and so on to
Liotriverdale and Selriverdale, till they came to Bearfirth.</p><br>

<p id="id00212">Now Swan began to speak, and gasped much. "Now Oswif's fetches
are seeking us out." Then up sprung Thiostolf, but Swan said,
"Go thou out with me, there won't be need of much." So they went
out both of them, and Swan took a goatskin and wrapped it about
his own head, and said, "Become mist and fog, become fright and
wonder mickle to all those who seek thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00213">Now, it must be told how Oswif, his friends, and his men are
riding along the ridge; then came a great mist against them, and
Oswif said, "This is Swan's doing; 'twere well if nothing worse
followed." A little after a mighty darkness came before their
eyes, so that they could see nothing, and then they fell off
their horses' backs, and lost their horses, and dropped their
weapons, and went over head and ears into bogs, and some went
astray into the wood, till they were on the brink of bodily harm.
Then Oswif said, "If I could only find my horse and weapons, then
I'd turn back;" and he had scarce spoken these words than they
saw somewhat, and found their horses and weapons. Then many
still egged the others on to look after the chase once more; and
so they did, and at once the same wonders befell them, and so
they fared thrice. Then Oswif said, "Though the course be not
good, let us still turn back. Now, we will take counsel a second
time, and what now pleases my mind best, is to go and find
Hauskuld, and ask atonement for my son; for there's no hope of
honour where there's good store of it."</p><br>

<p id="id00214">So they rode thence to the Broadfirth dales, and there is nothing
to be told about them till they came to Hauskuldstede, and Hrut
was there before them. Oswif called out Hauskuld and Hrut, and
they both went out and bade him good day. After that they began
to talk. Hauskuld asked Oswif whence he came. He said he had
set out to search for Thiostolf, but couldn't find him. Hauskuld
said he must have gone north to Swanshol, "and thither it is not
every man's lot to go to find him."</p><br>

<p id="id00215">"Well," says Oswif, "I am come hither for this, to ask atonement
for my son from thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00216">Hauskuld answered, "I did not slay thy son, nor did I plot his
death; still it may be forgiven thee to look for atonement
somewhere."</p><br>

<p id="id00217">"Nose is next of kin, brother, to eyes," said Hrut, "and it is
needful to stop all evil tongues, and to make him atonement for
his son, and so mend thy daughter's state, for that will only be
the case when this suit is dropped, and the less that is said
about it the better it will be."</p><br>

<p id="id00218">Hauskuld said, "Wilt thou undertake the award?"</p><br>

<p id="id00219">"That I will," says Hrut, "nor will I shield thee at all in my
award; for if the truth must be told thy daughter planned his
death."</p><br>

<p id="id00220">Then Hrut held his peace some little while, and afterwards he
stood up, and said to Oswif, "Take now my hand in handsel as a
token that thou lettest the suit drop."</p><br>

<p id="id00221">So Oswif stood up and said, "This is not an atonement on equal
terms when thy brother utters the award, but still thou (speaking
to Hrut) hast behaved so well about it that I trust thee
thoroughly to make it." Then he stood up and took Hauskuld's
hand, and came to an atonement in the matter, on the
understanding that Hrut was to make up his mind and utter the
award before Oswif went away. After that, Hrut made his award,
and said, "For the slaying of Thorwald I award two hundred in
silver" ??? that was then thought a good price for a man ??? "and
thou shalt pay it down at once, brother, and pay it too with an
open hand."</p><br>

<p id="id00222">Hauskuld did so, and then Hrut said to Oswif, "I will give thee a
good cloak which I brought with me from foreign lands."</p><br>

<p id="id00223">He thanked him for his gift, and went home well pleased at the
way in which things had gone.</p><br>

<p id="id00224">After that Hauskuld and Hrut came to Oswif to share the goods,
and they and Oswif came to a good agreement about that too, and
they went home with their share of the goods, and Oswif is now
out of our story. Hallgerda begged Hauskuld to let her come back
home to him, and he gave her leave, and for a long time there was
much talk about Thorwald's slaying. As for Hallgerda's goods
they went on growing till they were worth a great sum.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00225" style="margin-top: 3em">13. GLUM'S WOOING</h3>

<p id="id00226">Now three brothers are named in the story. One was called
Thorarin, the second Ragi, and the third Glum. They were the
sons of Olof the Halt, and were men of much worth and of great
wealth in goods. Thorarin's surname was Ragi's brother; he had
the Speakership of the Law after Rafn Heing's son. He was a very
wise man, and lived at Varmalek, and he and Glum kept house
together. Glum had been long abroad; he was a tall, strong,
handsome man. Ragi their brother was a great manslayer. Those
brothers owned in the south Engey and Laugarness. One day the
brothers Thorarin and Glum were talking together, and Thorarin
asked Glum whether he meant to go abroad, as was his wont?</p><br>

<p id="id00227">He answered, "I was rather thinking now of leaving off trading
voyages."</p><br>

<p id="id00228">"What hast thou then in thy mind? Wilt thou woo thee a wife?"</p><br>

<p id="id00229">"That I will," says he, "if I could only get myself well
matched."</p><br>

<p id="id00230">Then Thorarin told off all the women who were unwedded in
Borgarfirth, and asked him if he would have any of these, "Say
the word, and I will ride with thee!"</p><br>

<p id="id00231">But Glum answered, "I will have none of these."</p><br>

<p id="id00232">"Say then the name of her thou wishest to have," says Thorarin.</p><br>

<p id="id00233">Glum answered, "If thou must know, her name is Hallgerda, and she
is Hauskuld's daughter away west in the dales."</p><br>

<p id="id00234">"Well," says Thorarin, "'tis not with thee as the saw says, `be
warned by another's woe'; for she was wedded to a man, and she
plotted his death."</p><br>

<p id="id00235">Glum said, "Maybe such ill-luck will not befall her a second
time, and sure I am she will not plot my death. But now, if thou
wilt show me any honour, ride along with me to woo her."</p><br>

<p id="id00236">Thorarin said, "There's no good striving against it, for what
must be is sure to happen." Glum often talked the matter over
with Thorarin, but he put it off a long time. At last it came
about that they gathered men together and rode off ten in
company, west to the dales, and came to Hauskuldstede. Hauskuld
gave them a hearty welcome, and they stayed there that night.
But early next morning, Hauskuld sends for Hrut, and he came
thither at once: and Hauskuld was out of doors when he rode into
the "town". Then Hauskuld told Hrut what men had come thither.</p><br>

<p id="id00237">"What may it be they want?" asked Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00238">"As yet," says Hauskuld, "they have not let out to me that they
have any business."</p><br>

<p id="id00239">"Still," says Hrut, "their business must be with thee. They will
ask the hand of thy daughter, Hallgerda. If they do, what answer
wilt thou make?"</p><br>

<p id="id00240">"What dost thou advise me to say?" says Hauskuld.</p><br>

<p id="id00241">"Thou shalt answer well," says Hrut; "but still make a clean
breast of all the good and all the ill thou knowest of the
woman."</p><br>

<p id="id00242">But while the brothers were talking thus, out came the guests.
Hauskuld greeted them well, and Hrut bade both Thorarin and his
brothers good morning. After that they all began to talk, and
Thorarin said, "I am come hither, Hauskuld, with my brother Glum
on this errand, to ask for Hallgerda thy daughter, at the hand of
my brother Glum. Thou must know that he is a man of worth."</p><br>

<p id="id00243">"I know well," says Hauskuld, "that ye are both of you powerful
and worthy men; but I must tell you right out, that I chose a
husband for her before, and that turned out most unluckily for
us."</p><br>

<p id="id00244">Thorarin answered, "We will not let that stand in the way of the
bargain; for one oath shall not become all oaths, and this may
prove to be a good match, though that turned out ill; besides
Thiostolf had most hand in spoiling it."</p><br>

<p id="id00245">Then Hrut spoke: "Now I will give you a bit of advice ??? this: if
ye will not let all this that has already happened to Hallgerda
stand in the way of the match, mind you do not let Thiostolf go
south with her if the match comes off, and that he is never there
longer than three nights at a time, unless Glum gives him leave,
but fall an outlaw by Glum's hand without atonement if he stay
there longer. Of course, it shall be in Glum's power to give him
leave; but he will not if he takes my advice. And now this match
shall not be fulfilled, as the other was, without Hallgerda's
knowledge. She shall now know the whole course of this bargain,
and see Glum, and herself settle whether she will have him or
not; and then she will not be able to lay the blame on others if
it does not turn out well. And all this shall be without craft
or guile."</p><br>

<p id="id00246">Then Thorarin said, "Now, as always, it will prove best if thy
advice be taken."</p><br>

<p id="id00247">Then they sent for Hallgerda, and she came thither, and two women
with her. She had on a cloak of rich blue woof, and under it a
scarlet kirtle, and a silver girdle round her waist, but her hair
came down on both sides of her bosom, and she had turned the
locks up under her girdle. She sat down between Hrut and her
father, and she greeted them all with kind words, and spoke well
and boldly, and asked what was the news. After that she ceased
speaking.</p><br>

<p id="id00248">Then Glum said, "There has been some talk between thy father and
my brother Thorarin and myself about a bargain. It was that I
might get thee, Hallgerda, if it be thy will, as it is theirs;
and now, if thou art a brave woman, thou wilt say right out
whether the match is at all to thy mind; but if thou hast
anything in thy heart against this bargain with us, then we will
not say anything more about it."</p><br>

<p id="id00249">Hallgerda said, "I know well that you are men of worth and might,
ye brothers. I know too that now I shall be much better wedded
than I was before; but what I want to know is, what you have said
already about the match, and how far you have given your words in
the matter. But so far as I now see of thee, I think I might
love thee well if we can but hit it off as to temper."</p><br>

<p id="id00250">So Glum himself told her all about the bargain, and left nothing
out, and then he asked Hauskuld and Hrut whether he had repeated
it right. Hauskuld said he had; and then Hallgerda said, "Ye
have dealt so well with me in this matter, my father and Hrut,
that I will do what ye advise, and this bargain shall be struck
as ye have settled it."</p><br>

<p id="id00251">Then Hrut said, "Methinks it were best that Hauskuld and I should
name witnesses, and that Hallgerda should betroth herself, if the
Lawman thinks that right and lawful.</p><br>

<p id="id00252">"Right and lawful it is," says Thorarin.</p><br>

<p id="id00253">After that Hallgerda's goods were valued, and Glum was to lay
down as much against them, and they were to go shares, half and
half, in the whole. Then Glum bound himself to Hallgerda as his
betrothed, and they rode away home south; but Hauskuld was to
keep the wedding-feast at his house. And now all is quiet till
men ride to the wedding.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00254" style="margin-top: 3em">14. GLUM'S WEDDING</h3>

<p id="id00255">Those brothers gathered together a great company, and they were
all picked men. They rode west to the dales and came to
Hauskuldstede, and there they found a great gathering to meet
them. Hauskuld and Hrut, and their friends, filled one bench,
and the bridegroom the other. Hallgerda sat upon the cross bench
on the dais, and behaved well. Thiostolf went about with his axe
raised in air, and no one seemed to know that he was there, and
so the wedding went off well. But when the feast was over,
Hallgerda went away south with Glum and his brothers. So when
they came south to Varmalek, Thorarin asked Hallgerda if she
would undertake the housekeeping. "No, I will not," she said.
Hallgerda kept her temper down that winter, and they liked her
well enough. But when the spring came, the brothers talked about
their property, and Thorarin said, "I will give up to you the
house at Varmalek, for that is readiest to your hand, and I will
go down south to Laugarness and live there, but Engey we will
have both of us in common."</p><br>

<p id="id00256">Glum was willing enough to do that. So Thorarin went down to the
south of that district, and Glum and his wife stayed behind
there, and lived in the house at Varmalek.</p><br>

<p id="id00257">Now Hallgerda got a household about her; she was prodigal in
giving, and grasping in getting. In the summer she gave birth to
a girl. Glum asked her what name it was to have?</p><br>

<p id="id00258">"She shall be called after my father's mother, and her name shall
be Thorgerda," for she came down from Sigurd Fafnir's-bane on the
father's side, according to the family pedigree.</p><br>

<p id="id00259">So the maiden was sprinkled with water, and had this name given
her, and there she grew up, and got like her mother in looks and
feature. Glum and Hallgerda agreed well together, and so it went
on for a while. About that time these tidings were heard from
the north and Bearfirth, how Swan had rowed out to fish in the
spring, and a great storm came down on him from the east, and how
he was driven ashore at Fishless, and he and his men were there
lost. But the fishermen who were at Kalback thought they saw
Swan go into the fell at Kalbackshorn, and that he was greeted
well; but some spoke against that story, and said there was
nothing in it. But this all knew that he was never seen again
either alive or dead. So when Hallgerda heard that, she thought
she had a great loss in her mother's brother. Glum begged
Thorarin to change lands with him, but he said he would not;
"but," said he, "if I outlive you, I mean to have Varmalek to
myself." When Glum told this to Hallgerda, she said, "Thorarin
has indeed a right to expect this from us."</p><br>

<h3 id="id00260" style="margin-top: 3em">15. THIOSTOLF GOES TO GLUM'S HOUSE</h3>

<p id="id00261">Thiostolf had beaten one of Hauskuld's house-carles, so he drove
him away. He took his horse and weapons, and said to Hauskuld,
"Now, I will go away and never come back."</p><br>

<p id="id00262">"All will be glad at that," says Hauskuld.</p><br>

<p id="id00263">Thiostolf rode till he came to Varmalek, and there he got a
hearty welcome from Hallgerda, and not a bad one from Glum. He
told Hallgerda how her father had driven him away, and begged her
to give him her help and countenance. She answered him by
telling him she could say nothing about his staying there before
she had seen Glum about it.</p><br>

<p id="id00264">"Does it go well between you?" he says.</p><br>

<p id="id00265">"Yes," she says, "our love runs smooth enough."</p><br>

<p id="id00266">After that she went to speak to Glum, and threw her arms round
his neck and said, "Wilt thou grant me a boon which I wish to ask
of thee?"</p><br>

<p id="id00267">"Grant it I will," he says, "if it be right and seemly; but what
is it thou wishest to ask?"</p><br>

<p id="id00268">"Well," she said, "Thiostolf has been driven away from the west,
and what I want thee to do is to let him stay here; but I will
not take it crossly if it is not to thy mind."</p><br>

<p id="id00269">Glum said, "Now that thou behavest so well, I will grant thee thy
boon; but I tell thee, if he takes to any ill he shall be sent
off at once."</p><br>

<p id="id00270">She goes then to Thiostolf and tells him, and he answered, "Now,
thou art still good, as I had hoped."</p><br>

<p id="id00271">After that he was there, and kept himself down a little while,
but then it was the old story, he seemed to spoil all the good he
found; for he gave way to no one save to Hallgerda alone, but she
never took his side in his brawls with others. Thorarin, Glum's
brother, blamed him for letting him be there, and said ill luck
would come of it, and all would happen as had happened before if
he were there. Glum answered him well and kindly, but still kept
on in his own way.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00272" style="margin-top: 3em">16. GLUM'S SHEEP HUNT</h3>

<p id="id00273">Now once on a time when autumn came, it happened that men had
hard work to get their flocks home, and many of Glum's wethers
were missing. Then Glum said to Thiostolf, "Go thou up on the
fell with my house-carles and see if ye cannot find out anything
about the sheep."</p><br>

<p id="id00274">"'Tis no business of mine," says Thiostolf, "to hunt up sheep,
and this one thing is quite enough to hinder it. I won't walk in
thy thralls' footsteps. But go thyself, and then I'll go with
thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00275">About this they had many words. The weather was good, and
Hallgerda was sitting out of doors. Glum went up to her and
said, "Now Thiostolf and I have had a quarrel, and we shall not
live much longer together." And so he told her all that they had
been talking about.</p><br>

<p id="id00276">Then Hallgerda spoke up for Thiostolf, and they had many words
about him. At last Glum gave her a blow with his hand, and said,
"I will strive no longer with thee," and with that he went away.</p><br>

<p id="id00277">Now she loved him much, and could not calm herself, but wept out
loud. Thiostolf went up to her and said, "This is sorry sport
for thee, and so it must not be often again."</p><br>

<p id="id00278">"Nay," she said, "but thou shalt not avenge this, nor meddle at
all whatever passes between Glum and me."</p><br>

<p id="id00279">He went off with a spiteful grin.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00280" style="margin-top: 3em">17. GLUM'S SLAYING</h3>

<p id="id00281">Now Glum called men to follow him, and Thiostolf got ready and
went with them. So they went up South Reykiardale and then up
along by Baugagil and so south to Crossfell. But some of his
band he sent to the Sulafells, and they all found very many
sheep. Some of them, too, went by way of Scoradale, and it came
about at last that those twain, Glum and Thiostolf, were left
alone together. They went south from Crossfell and found there a
flock of wild sheep, and they went from the south towards the
fell, and tried to drive them down; but still the sheep got away
from them up on the fell. Then each began to scold the other,
and Thiostolf said at last that Glum had no strength save to
tumble about in Hallgerda's arms.</p><br>

<p id="id00282">Then Glum said, "`A man's foes are those of his own house.'<br>

Shall I take upbraiding from thee, runaway thrall as thou art?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00283">Thiostolf said, "Thou shalt soon have to own that I am no thrall,
for I will not yield an inch to thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00284">Then Glum got angry, and cut at him with his hand-axe, but he
threw his axe in the way, and the blow fell on the haft with a
downward stroke and bit into it about the breadth of two fingers.
Thiostolf cut at him at once with his axe, and smote him on the
shoulder, and the stroke hewed asunder the shoulderbone and
collarbone, and the wound bled inwards. Glum grasped at
Thiostolf with his left hand so fast, that he fell; but Glum
could not hold him, for death came over him. Then Thiostolf
covered his body with stones, and took off his gold ring. Then
he went straight to Varmalek. Hallgerda was sitting out of
doors, and saw that his axe was bloody. He said, "I know not
what thou wilt think of it, but I tell thee Glum is slain."</p><br>

<p id="id00285">"That must be thy deed," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00286">"So it is," he says.</p><br>

<p id="id00287">She laughed and said, "Thou dost not stand for nothing in this
sport."</p><br>

<p id="id00288">"What thinkest thou is best to be done now?" he asked.</p><br>

<p id="id00289">"Go to Hrut, my father's brother," she said, "and let him see
about thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00290">"I do not know," says Thiostolf, "whether this is good advice;
but still I will take thy counsel in this matter."</p><br>

<p id="id00291">So he took his horse, and rode west to Hrutstede that night. He
binds his horse at the back of the house, and then goes round to
the door, and gives a great knock. After that he walks round the
house, north about. It happened that Hrut was awake. He sprang
up at once, and put on his jerkin and pulled on his shoes. Then
he took up his sword, and wrapped a cloak about his left arm, up
as far as the elbow. Men woke up just as he went out; there he
saw a tall stout man at the back of the house, and knew it was
Thiostolf. Hrut asked him what news?</p><br>

<p id="id00292">"I tell thee Glum is slain." says Thiostolf.</p><br>

<p id="id00293">"Who did the deed?" says Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00294">"I slew him," says Thiostolf.</p><br>

<p id="id00295">"Why rodest thou hither?" says Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00296">"Hallgerda sent me to thee," says Thiostolf.</p><br>

<p id="id00297">"Then she has no hand in this deed," says Hrut, and drew his
sword. Thiostolf saw that, and would not be behind hand, so he
cuts at Hrut at once. Hrut got out of the way of the stroke by a
quick turn, and at the same time struck the back of the axe so
smartly with a side-long blow of his left hand, that it flew out
of Thiostolf's grasp. Then Hrut made a blow with his sword in
his right hand at Thiostolf's leg, just above the knee, and cut
it almost off so that it hung by a little piece, and sprang in
upon him at the same time, and thrust him hard back. After that
he smote him on the head, and dealt him his death-blow.
Thiostolf fell down on his back at full length, and then out came
Hrut's men, and saw the tokens of the deed. Hrut made them take
Thiostolf away, and throw stones over his body, and then he went
to find Hauskuld, and told him of Glum's slaying, and also of
Thiostolf's. He thought it harm that Glum was dead and gone, but
thanked him for killing Thiostolf. A little while after,
Thorarin Ragi's brother hears of his brother Glum's death, then
he rides with eleven men behind him west to Hauskuldstede, and
Hauskuld welcomed him with both hands, and he is there the night.
Hauskuld sent at once for Hrut to come to him, and he went at
once, and next day they spoke much of the slaying of Glum, and
Thorarin said "Wilt thou make me any atonement for my brother,
for I have had a great loss?"</p><br>

<p id="id00298">Hauskuld answered, "I did not slay thy brother, nor did my
daughter plot his death; but as soon as ever Hrut knew it he slew
Thiostolf."</p><br>

<p id="id00299">Then Thorarin held his peace, and thought the matter had taken a
bad turn. But Hrut said, "Let us make his journey good; he has
indeed had a heavy loss, and if we do that we shall be well
spoken of. So let us give him gifts, and then he will be our
friend ever afterwards."</p><br>

<p id="id00300">So the end of it was, that those brothers gave him gifts, and he
rode back south. He and Hallgerda changed homesteads in the
spring, and she went south to Laugarness and he to Varmalek. And
now Thorarin is out of the story.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00301" style="margin-top: 3em">18. FIDDLE MORD'S DEATH</h3>

<p id="id00302">Now it must be told how Fiddle Mord took a sickness and breathed
his last; and that was thought great scathe. His daughter Unna
took all the goods he left behind him. She was then still
unmarried the second time. She was very layish, and unthrifty of
her property; so that her goods and ready money wasted away, and
at last she had scarce anything left but land and stock.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00303" style="margin-top: 3em">19. GUNNAR COMES INTO THE STORY</h3>

<p id="id00304">There was a man whose name was Gunnar. He was one of Unna's
kinsmen, and his mother's name was Rannveig (1). Gunnar's father
was named Hamond (2). Gunnar Hamond's son dwelt at Lithend, in
the Fleetlithe. He was a tall man in growth, and a strong man ???
best skilled in arms of all men. He could cut or thrust or shoot
if he chose as well with his left as with his right hand, and he
smote so swiftly with his sword, that three seemed to flash
through the air at once. He was the best shot with the bow of
all men, and never missed his mark. He could leap more than his
own height, with all his war-gear, and as far backwards as
forwards. He could swim like a seal, and there was no game in
which it was any good for any one to strive with him; and so it
has been said that no man was his match. He was handsome of
feature, and fair skinned. His nose was straight, and a little
turned up at the end. He was blue-eyed and bright-eyed, and
ruddy-cheeked. His hair thick, and of good hue, and hanging down
in comely curls. The most courteous of men was he, of sturdy
frame and strong will, bountiful and gentle, a fast friend, but
hard to please when making them. He was wealthy in goods. His
brother's name was Kolskegg; he was a tall strong man, a noble
fellow, and undaunted in everything. Another brother's name was
Hjort; he was then in his childhood. Orm Skogarnef was a base-
born brother of Gunnar's; he does not come into this story.
Arnguda was the name of Gunnar's sister. Hroar, the priest at
Tongue, had her to wife (3).</p><br>

<h4 id="id00305" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hrafn the Speaker of the Law, the son of Storolf was Orin<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Strong.<br>

(3) He was the son of Uni the Unborn, Gardar's son who found<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iceland. Arnguda's son was Hamond the Halt, who dwelt at<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamondstede.<br>
</p><br>

<h3 id="id00307" style="margin-top: 3em">20. OF NJAL AND HIS CHILDREN</h3>

<p id="id00308">There was a man whose name was Njal. He was the son of Thorgeir
Gelling, the son of Thorolf. Njal's mother's name was Asgerda
(1). Njal dwelt at Bergthorsknoll in the land-isles; he had
another homestead on Thorolfsfell. Njal was wealthy in goods,
and handsome of face; no beard grew on his chin. He was so great
a lawyer, that his match was not to be found. Wise too he was,
and foreknowing and foresighted (2). Of good counsel, and ready
to give it, and all that he advised men was sure to be the best
for them to do. Gentle and generous, he unravelled every man's
knotty points who came to see him about them. Bergthora was his
wife's name; she was Skarphedinn's daughter, a very high-
spirited, brave-hearted woman, but somewhat hard-tempered. They
had six children, three daughters and three sons, and they all
come afterwards into this story.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00309" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id00310">(1) She was the daughter of Lord Ar the Silent. She had come<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out hither to Iceland from Norway, and taken land to the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west of Markfleet, between Auldastone and Selialandsmull.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her son was Holt-Thorir, the father of Thorleif Crow, from<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom the Wood-dwellers are sprung, and of Thorgrim the Tall,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Skorargeir.<br>

(2) This means that Njal was one of those gifted beings who,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the firm belief of that age, had a more than<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human insight into things about to happen. It answers very<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearly to the Scottish "second sight."<br>
</p><br>

<h3 id="id00311" style="margin-top: 3em">21. UNNA GOES TO SEE GUNNAR</h3>

<p id="id00312">Now it must be told how Unna had lost all her ready money. She
made her way to Lithend, and Gunnar greeted his kinswoman well.
She stayed there that night, and the next morning they sat out of
doors and talked. The end of their talk was, that she told him
how heavily she was pressed for money.</p><br>

<p id="id00313">"This is a bad business," he said.</p><br>

<p id="id00314">"What help wilt thou give me out of my distress?" she asked.</p><br>

<p id="id00315">He answered, "Take as much money as thou needest from what I have
out at interest."</p><br>

<p id="id00316">"Nay," she said, "I will not waste thy goods."</p><br>

<p id="id00317">"What then dost thou wish?"</p><br>

<p id="id00318">"I wish thee to get back my goods out of Hrut's hands," she
answered.</p><br>

<p id="id00319">"That, methinks, is not likely," said he, "when thy father could
not get them back, and yet he was a great lawyer, but I know
little about law."</p><br>

<p id="id00320">She answered, "Hrut pushed that matter through rather by boldness
than by law; besides, my father was old, and that was why men
thought it better not to drive things to the uttermost. And now
there is none of my kinsmen to take this suit up if thou hast not
daring enough."</p><br>

<p id="id00321">"I have courage enough," he replied, "to get these goods back;
but I do not know how to take the suit up."</p><br>

<p id="id00322">"Well!" she answered, "go and see Njal of Bergthorsknoll, he will
know how to give thee advice. Besides, he is a great friend of
thine."</p><br>

<p id="id00323">"'Tis like enough he will give me good advice, as he gives it to
every one else," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00324">So the end of their talk was, that Gunnar undertook her cause,
and gave her the money she needed for her housekeeping, and after
that she went home.</p><br>

<p id="id00325">Now Gunnar rides to see Njal, and he made him welcome, and they
began to talk at once.</p><br>

<p id="id00326">Then Gunnar said, "I am come to seek a bit of good advice from
thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00327">Njal replied, "Many of my friends are worthy of this, but still I
think I would take more pains for none than for thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00328">Gunnar said, "I wish to let thee know that I have undertaken to
get Unna's goods back from Hrut."</p><br>

<p id="id00329">"A very hard suit to undertake," said Njal, "and one very
hazardous how it will go; but still I will get it up for thee in
the way I think likeliest to succeed, and the end will be good if
thou breakest none of the rules I lay down; if thou dost, thy
life is in danger."</p><br>

<p id="id00330">"Never fear; I will break none of them," said Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00331">Then Njal held his peace for a little while, and after that he
spoke as follows: ???</p><br>

<h3 id="id00332" style="margin-top: 3em">22. NJAL'S ADVICE</h3>

<p id="id00333">"I have thought over the suit, and it will do so. Thou shalt ride
from home with two men at thy back. Over all thou shalt have a
great rough cloak, and under that, a russet kirtle of cheap
stuff, and under all, thy good clothes. Thou must take a small
axe in thy hand, and each of you must have two horses, one fat,
the other lean. Thou shalt carry hardware and smith's work with
thee hence, and ye must ride off early to-morrow morning, and
when ye are come across Whitewater westwards, mind and slouch thy
hat well over thy brows. Then men will ask who is this tall man,
and thy mates shall say, `Here is Huckster Hedinn the Big, a man
from Eyjafirth, who is going about with smith's work for sale.'
This Hedinn is ill-tempered and a chatterer ??? a fellow who
thinks he alone knows everything. Very often he snatches back
his wares, and flies at men if everything is not done as he
wishes. So thou shalt ride west to Borgarfirth offering all
sorts of wares for sale, and be sure often to cry off thy
bargains, so that it will be noised abroad that Huckster Hedinn
is the worst of men to deal with, and that no lies have been told
of his bad behaviour. So thou shalt ride to Northwaterdale, and
to Hrutfirth, and Laxriverdale, till thou comest to
Hauskuldstede. There thou must stay a night, and sit in the
lowest place, and hang thy head down. Hauskuld will tell them
all not to meddle nor make with Huckster Hedinn, saying he is a
rude unfriendly fellow. Next morning thou must be off early and
go to the farm nearest Hrutstede. There thou must offer thy
goods for sale, praising up all that is worst, and tinkering up
the faults. The master of the house will pry about and find out
the faults. Thou must snatch the wares away from him, and speak
ill to him. He will say, 'twas not to be hoped that thou wouldst
behave well to him, when thou behavest ill to every one else.
Then thou shalt fly at him, though it is not thy wont, but mind
and spare thy strength, that thou mayest not be found out. Then
a man will be sent to Hrutstede to tell Hrut he had best come and
part you. He will come at once and ask thee to his house, and
thou must accept his offer. Thou shalt greet Hrut and he will
answer well. A place will be given thee on the lower bench over
against Hrut's high seat. He will ask if thou art from the
North, and thou shalt answer that thou art a man of Eyjafirth.
He will go on to ask if there are very many famous men there.
`Shabby fellows enough and to spare,' thou must answer. `Dost
thou know Reykiardale and the parts about?' he will ask. To
which thou must answer, `I know all Iceland by heart.'</p><br>

<p id="id00334">"`Are there any stout champions left in Reykiardale?' he will
ask. `Thieves and scoundrels,' thou shalt answer. Then Hrut
will smile and think it sport to listen. You two will go on to
talk of the men in the Eastfirth Quarter, and thou must always
find something to say against them. At last your talk will come
Rangrivervale, and then thou must say, there is small choice of
men left in those parts since Fiddle Mord died. At the same time
sing some stave to please Hrut, for I know thou art a skald.
Hrut will ask what makes thee say there is never a man to come in
Mord's place? and then thou must answer, that he was so wise a
man and so good a taker up of suits, that he never made a false
step in upholding his leadership. He will ask, `Dost thou know
how matters fared between me and him?'</p><br>

<p id="id00335">"`I know all about it,' thou must reply, `he took thy wife from
thee, and thou hadst not a word to say.'</p><br>

<p id="id00336">"Then Hrut will ask, `Dost thou not think it was some disgrace to
him when he could not get back his goods, though he set the suit
on foot?'</p><br>

<p id="id00337">"`I can answer thee that well enough,' thou must say. `Thou
challengedst him to single combat; but he was old, and so his
friends advised him not to fight with thee, and then they let the
suit fall to the ground.'</p><br>

<p id="id00338">"`True enough,' Hrut will say. `I said so, and that passed for
law among foolish men; but the suit might have been taken up
again at another Thing if he had the heart.'</p><br>

<p id="id00339">"`I know all that,' thou must say.</p><br>

<p id="id00340">"Then he will ask, `Dost thou know anything about law?'</p><br>

<p id="id00341">"`Up in the North I am thought to know something about it,' thou
shalt say. `But still I should like thee to tell me how this
suit should be taken up.'</p><br>

<p id="id00342">"`What suit dost thou mean?' he will ask.</p><br>

<p id="id00343">"`A suit,' thou must answer, `which does not concern me. I want
to know how a man must set to work who wishes to get back Unna's
dower.'</p><br>

<p id="id00344">"Then Hrut will say, `In this suit I must be summoned so that I
can hear the summons, or I must be summoned here in my lawful
house.'</p><br>

<p id="id00345">"`Recite the summons, then,' thou must say, 'and I will say it
after thee.'</p><br>

<p id="id00346">"Then Hrut will summon himself; and mind and pay great heed to
every word he says. After that Hrut will bid thee repeat the
summons, and thou must do so, and say it all wrong, so that no
more than every other word is right.</p><br>

<p id="id00347">"Then Hrut will smile and not mistrust thee, but say that scarce a
word is right. Thou must throw the blame on thy companions, and
say they put thee out, and then thou must ask him to say the
words first, word by word, and to let thee say the words after
him. He will give thee leave, and summon himself in the suit,
and thou shalt summon after him there and then, and this time say
every word right. When it is done, ask Hrut if that were rightly
summoned, and he will answer, `There is no flaw to be found in
it.' Then thou shalt say in a loud voice, so that thy companions
may hear, `I summon thee in the suit which Unna, Mord's daughter,
has made over to me with her plighted hand.'</p><br>

<p id="id00348">"But when men are sound asleep, you shall rise and take your
bridles and saddles, and tread softly, and go out of the house,
and put your saddles on your fat horses in the fields, and so
ride off on them, but leave the others behind you. You must ride
up into the hills away from the home pastures and stay there
three nights, for about so long will they seek you. After that
ride home south, riding always by night and resting by day. As
for us, we will then ride this summer to the Thing, and help thee
in thy suit." So Gunnar thanked Njal, and first of all rode
home.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00349" style="margin-top: 3em">23. HUCKSTER HEDINN.</h3>

<p id="id00350">Gunnar rode from home two nights afterwards, and two men with
him; they rode along until they got on Bluewoodheath and then men
on horseback met them and asked who that tall man might be of
whom so little was seen. But his companions said it was Huckster
Hedinn. Then the others said a worse was not to be looked for
behind, when such a man as he went before. Hedinn at once made
as though he would have set upon them, but yet each went their
way. So Gunnar went on doing everything as Njal had laid it down
for him, and when he came to Hauskuldstede he stayed there the
night, and thence he went down the dale till he came to the next
farm to Hrutstede. There he offered his wares for sale, and
Hedinn fell at once upon the farmer. This was told to Hrut, and
he sent for Hedinn, and Hedinn went at once to see Hrut, and had
a good welcome. Hrut seated him over against himself, and their
talk went pretty much as Njal had guessed; but when they came to
talk of Rangrivervale, and Hrut asked about the men there, Gunnar
sung this stave ???</p><br>

<p id="id00351">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men in sooth are slow to find ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the people speak by stealth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often this hath reached my ears ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through Rangar's rolling vales.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still I trow that Fiddle Mord,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried his hand in fight of yore;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure was never gold-bestower,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a man for might and wit."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00352">Then Hrut said, "Thou art a skald, Hedinn. But hast thou never
heard how things went between me and Mord?" Then Hedinn sung
another stave ???</p><br>

<p id="id00353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once I ween I heard the rumour,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Lord of rings (1) bereft thee;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thine arms earth's offspring (2) tearing,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trickfull he and trustful thou.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the men, the buckler-bearers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begged the mighty gold-begetter,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp sword oft of old he reddened,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to stand in strife with thee."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00354">So they went on, till Hrut, in answer told him how the suit must
be taken up, and recited the summons. Hedinn repeated it all
wrong, and Hrut burst out laughing, and had no mistrust. Then he
said, Hrut must summon once more, and Hrut did so. Then Hedinn
repeated the summons a second time, and this time right, and
called his companions to witness how he summoned Hrut in a suit
which Unna, Mord's daughter, had made over to him with her
plighted hand. At night he went to sleep like other men, but as
soon as ever Hrut was sound asleep, they took their clothes and
arms, and went out and came to their horses, and rode off across
the river, and so up along the bank by Hiardarholt till the dale
broke off among the hills, and so there they are upon the fells
between Laxriverdale and Hawkdale, having got to a spot where no
one could find them unless he had fallen on them by chance.</p><br>

<p id="id00355">Hauskuld wakes up that night at Hauskuldstede, and roused all his
household. "I will tell you my dream," he said. "I thought I
saw a great bear go out of this house, and I knew at once this
beast's match was not to be found; two cubs followed him, wishing
well to the bear, and they all made for Hrutstede and went into
the house there. After that I woke. Now I wish to ask if any of
you saw aught about yon tall man."</p><br>

<p id="id00356">Then one man answered him, "I saw how a golden fringe and a bit
of scarlet cloth peeped out at his arm, and on his right arm he
had a ring of gold."</p><br>

<p id="id00357">Hauskuld said, "This beast is no man's fetch, but Gunnar's of
Lithend, and now methinks I see all about it. Up! let us ride
to Hrutstede," And they did so. Hrut lay in his locked bed, and
asks who have come there? Hauskuld tells who he is, and asked
what guests might be there in the house?</p><br>

<p id="id00358">"Only Huckster Hedinn is here," says Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00359">"A broader man across the back, it will be, I fear," says<br>

Hauskuld, "I guess here must have been Gunnar of Lithend."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00360">"Then there has been a pretty trial of cunning," says Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00361">"What has happened?" says Hauskuld.</p><br>

<p id="id00362">"I told him how to take up Unna's suit, and I summoned myself and
he summoned after, and now he can use this first step in the
suit, and it is right in law."</p><br>

<p id="id00363">"There has, indeed, been a great falling off of wit on one side,"
said Hauskuld, "and Gunnar cannot have planned it all by himself;
Njal must be at the bottom of this plot, for there is not his
match for wit in all the land."</p><br>

<p id="id00364">Now they look for Hedinn, but he is already off and away; after
that they gathered folk, and looked for them three days, but
could not find them. Gunnar rode south from the fell to Hawkdale
and so east of Skard, and north to Holtbeaconheath, and so on
until he got home.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00365" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id00366">(1) "Lord of rings," a periphrasis for a chief, that is, Mord.
(2) "Earth's offspring," a periphrasis for woman, that is, Unna.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00367" style="margin-top: 3em">24. GUNNAR AND HRUT STRIVE AT THE THING.</h3>

<p id="id00368">Gunnar rode to the Althing, and Hrut and Hauskuld rode thither
too with a very great company. Gunnar pursues his suit, and
began by calling on his neighbours to bear witness, but Hrut and
his brother had it in their minds to make an onslaught on him,
but they mistrusted their strength.</p><br>

<p id="id00369">Gunnar next went to the court of the men of Broadfirth, and bade
Hrut listen to his oath and declaration of the cause of the suit,
and to all the proofs which he was about to bring forward. After
that he took his oath, and declared his case. After that he
brought forward his witnesses of the summons, along with his
witnesses that the suit had been handed over to him. All this
time Njal was not at the court. Now Gunnar pursued his suit till
he called on the defendant to reply. Then Hrut took witness, and
said the suit was naught, and that there was a flaw in the
pleading; he declared that it had broken down because Gunnar had
failed to call those three witnesses which ought to have been
brought before the court. The first, that which was taken before
the marriage-bed, the second, before the man's door, the third,
at the Hill of Laws. By this time Njal was come to the court and
said the suit and pleading might still be kept alive if they
chose to strive in that way.</p><br>

<p id="id00370">"No," says Gunnar, "I will not have that; I will do the same to
Hrut as he did to Mord my kinsman; or, are those brothers Hrut
and Hauskuld so near that they may hear my voice."</p><br>

<p id="id00371">"Hear it we can," says Hrut. "What dost thou wish?"</p><br>

<p id="id00372">Gunnar said, "Now all men here present be ear-witnesses, that I
challenge thee Hrut to single combat, and we shall fight to-day
on the holm, which is here in Oxwater. But if thou wilt not
fight with me, then pay up all the money this very day."</p><br>

<p id="id00373">After that Gunnar sung a stave ???</p><br>

<p id="id00374">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so must it be, this morning ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my mind is full of fire ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hrut with me on yonder island<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raises roar of helm and shield.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that bear my words bear witness,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors grasping Woden's guard,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the wealthy wight down payeth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dower of wife with flowing veil."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00375">After that Gunnar went away from the court with all his
followers. Hrut and Hauskuld went home too, and the suit was
never pursued nor defended from that day forth. Hrut said, as
soon as he got inside the booth, "This has never happened to me
before, that any man has offered me combat and I have shunned
it."</p><br>

<p id="id00376">"Then thou must mean to fight," says Hauskuld, "but that shall
not be if I have my way; for thou comest no nearer to Gunnar than
Mord would have come to thee, and we had better both of us pay up
the money to Gunnar."</p><br>

<p id="id00377">After that the brothers asked the householders of their own
country what they would lay down, and they one and all said they
would lay down as much as Hrut wished.</p><br>

<p id="id00378">"Let us go then," says Hauskuld, "to Gunnar's booth, and pay down
the money out of hand." That was told to Gunnar, and he went out
into the doorway of the booth, and Hauskuld said, "Now it is
thine to take the money."</p><br>

<p id="id00379">Gunnar said, "Pay it down, then, for I am ready to take it."</p><br>

<p id="id00380">So they paid down the money truly out of hand, and then Hauskuld
said, "Enjoy it now, as thou hast gotten it." Then Gunnar sang
another stave: ???</p><br>

<p id="id00381">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men who wield the blade of battle<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoarded wealth may well enjoy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guileless gotten this at least,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden meed I fearless take;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we for woman's quarrel,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors born to brandish sword,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glut the wolf with manly gore,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse the lot of both would be."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00382">Hrut answered, "Ill will be thy meed for this."</p><br>

<p id="id00383">"Be that as it may," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00384">Then Hauskuld and his brother went home to their booth, and he
had much upon his mind, and said to Hrut, "Will this unfairness
of Gunnar's never be avenged?"</p><br>

<p id="id00385">"Not so," says Hrut; "'twill be avenged on him sure enough, but
we shall have no share nor profit in that vengeance. And after
all it is most likely that he will turn to our stock to seek for
friends."</p><br>

<p id="id00386">After that they left off speaking of the matter. Gunnar showed<br>

Njal the money, and he said, "The suit has gone off well."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00387">"Ay," says Gunnar, "but it was all thy doing."</p><br>

<p id="id00388">Now men rode home from the Thing, and Gunnar got very great
honour from the suit. Gunnar handed over all the money to Unna,
and would have none of it, but said he thought he ought to look
more for help from her and her kin hereafter than from other men.
She said, so it should be.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00389" style="margin-top: 3em">25. UNNA'S SECOND WEDDING</h3>

<p id="id00390">There was a man named Valgard, he kept house at Hof by Rangriver,
he was the son of Jorund the Priest, and his brother was Wolf
Aurpriest (1). Those brothers, Wolf Aurpriest, and Valgard the
Guileful, set off to woo Unna, and she gave herself away to
Valgard without the advice of any of her kinsfolk. But Gunnar
and Njal, and many others thought ill of that, for he was a
cross-grained man and had few friends. They begot between them a
son, whose name was Mord, and he is long in this story. When he
was grown to man's estate, he worked ill to his kinsfolk but
worst of all to Gunnar. He was a crafty man in his temper, but
spiteful in his counsels.</p><br>

<p id="id00391">Now we will name Njal's sons. Skarphedinn was the eldest of
them. He was a tall man in growth, and strong withal; a good
swordsman; he could swim like a seal, the swiftest-looted of men,
and bold and dauntless; he had a great flow of words and quick
utterance; a good skald too; but still for the most part he kept
himself well in hand; his hair was dark brown, with crisp curly
locks; he had good eyes; his features were sharp, and his face
ashen pale, his nose turned up and his front teeth stuck out, and
his mouth was very ugly. Still he was the most soldierlike of
men.</p><br>

<p id="id00392">Grim was the name of Njal's second son. He was fair of face and
wore his hair long. His hair was dark, and he was comelier to
look on than Skarphedinn. A tall strong man.</p><br>

<p id="id00393">Helgi was the name of Njal's third son. He too was fair of face
and had fine hair. He was a strong man and well-skilled in arms.
He was a man of sense and knew well how to behave. They were all
unwedded at that time, Njal's sons.</p><br>

<p id="id00394">Hauskuld was the fourth of Njal's sons. He was baseborn. His
mother was Rodny, and she was Hauskuld's daughter, the sister of
Ingialld of the Springs.</p><br>

<p id="id00395">Njal asked Skarphedinn one day if he would take to himself a
wife. He bade his father settle the matter. Then Njal asked for
his hand Thorhilda, the daughter of Ranvir of Thorolfsfell, and
that was why they had another homestead there after that.

<p id="id00399">There was a man named Asgrim (1). He was Ellidagrim's son. The
brother of Asgrim Ellidagrim's son was Sigfus (2). Gauk
Trandil's son was Asgrim's foster-brother, who is said to have
been the fairest man of his day, and best skilled in all things;
but matters went ill with them, for Asgrim slew Gauk.</p><br>

<p id="id00400">Asgrim had two sons, and each of them was named Thorhall. They
were both hopeful men. Grim was the name of another of Asgrim's
sons, and Thorhalla was his daughter's name. She was the fairest
of women, and well behaved.</p><br>

<p id="id00401">Njal came to talk with his son Helgi, and said, "I have thought
of a match for thee, if thou wilt follow my advice."</p><br>

<p id="id00402">"That I will surely," says he, "for I know that thou both meanest
me well, and canst do well for me; but whither hast thou turned

<p id="id00407">A little after they rode out across Thurso water, and fared till
they came into Tongue. Asgrim was at home, and gave them a
hearty welcome; and they were there that night. Next morning
they began to talk, and then Njal raised the question of the
wooing, and asked for Thorhalla for his son Helgi's hand. Asgrim
answered that well, and said there were no men with whom he would
be more willing to make this bargain than with them. They fell
a-talking then about terms, and the end of it was that Asgrim
betrothed his daughter to Helgi, and the bridal day was named.
Gunnar was at that feast, and many other of the bestmen. After
the feast Njal offered to foster in his house Thorhall, Asgrim's
son, and he was with Njal long after. He loved Njal more than
his own father. Njal taught him law, so that he became the
greatest lawyer in Iceland in those days.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00408" style="margin-top: 3em">28. HALLVARD COMES OUT TO ICELAND</h3>

<p id="id00409">There came a ship out from Norway, and ran into Arnbael's Oyce
(1), and the master of the ship was Hallvard the White, a man
from the Bay (2). He went to stay at Lithend, and was with
Gunnar that winter, and was always asking him to fare abroad with
him. Gunnar spoke little about it, but yet said more unlikely
things might happen; and about spring he went over to
Bergthorsknoll to find out from Njal whether he thought it a wise
step in him to go abroad.</p><br>

<p id="id00410">"I think it is wise," says Njal; "they will think thee there an
honourable man, as thou art."</p><br>

<p id="id00411">"Wilt thou perhaps take my goods into thy keeping while I am
away, for I wish my brother Kolskegg to fare with me; but I would
that thou shouldst see after my household along with my mother."</p><br>

<p id="id00412">"I will not throw anything in the way of that," says Njal; "lean
on me in this thing as much as thou likest."</p><br>

<p id="id00413">"Good go with thee for thy words," says Gunnar, and he rides
then home.</p><br>

<p id="id00414">The Easterling (3) fell again to talk with Gunnar that he should<br>

fare abroad. Gunnar asked if he had ever sailed to other lands?<br>

He said he had sailed to every one of them that lay between<br>

Norway and Russia, and so, too, I have sailed to Biarmaland (4).<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00415">"Wilt thou sail with me eastward ho?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00416">"That I will of a surety," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00417">Then Gunnar made up his mind to sail abroad with him. Njal took
all Gunnar's goods into his keeping.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00420" style="margin-top: 3em">29. GUNNAR GOES ABROAD</h3>

<p id="id00421">So Gunnar fared abroad, and Kolskegg with him. They sailed first
to Tonsberg (1), and were there that winter. There had then been
a shift of rulers in Norway. Harold Grayfell was then dead, and
so was Gunnhillda. Earl Hacon the Bad, Sigurd's son, Hacon's
son, Gritgarth's son, then ruled the realm. The mother of Hacon
was Bergliot, the daughter of Earl Thorir. Her mother was Olof
Harvest-heal. She was Harold Fair-hair's daughter.</p><br>

<p id="id00422">Hallvard asks Gunnar if he would make up his mind to go to Earl<br>

Hacon?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00423">"No; I will not do that," says Gunnar. "Hast thou ever a long-
ship?"</p><br>

<p id="id00424">"I have two," he says.</p><br>

<p id="id00425">"Then I would that we two went on warfare; and let us get men to
go with us."</p><br>

<p id="id00426">"I will do that," says Hallvard.</p><br>

<p id="id00427">After that they went to the Bay, and took with them two ships,
and fitted them out thence. They had good choice of men, for
much praise was said of Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00428">"Whither wilt thou first fare?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00429">"I wish to go south-east to Hisingen, to see my kinsman Oliver,"
says Hallvard.</p><br>

<p id="id00430">"What dost thou want of him?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00431">He answered, "He is a fine brave fellow, and he will be sure to
get us some more strength for our voyage."</p><br>

<p id="id00432">"Then let us go thither," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00433">So, as soon as they were "boun," they held on east to Hisingen,
and had there a hearty welcome. Gunnar had only been there a
short time ere Oliver made much of him. Oliver asks about his
voyage, and Hallvard says that Gunnar wishes to go a-warfaring to
gather goods for himself.</p><br>

<p id="id00434">"There's no use thinking of that," says Oliver, "when ye have no
force."</p><br>

<p id="id00435">"Well," says Hallvard, "then you may add to it."</p><br>

<p id="id00436">"So I do mean to strengthen Gunnar somewhat," says Oliver; "and
though thou reckonest thyself my kith and kin, I think there is
more good in him."</p><br>

<p id="id00437">"What force, now, wilt thou add to ours?" he asks.</p><br>

<p id="id00438">"Two long-ships, one with twenty, and the other with thirty seats
for rowers."</p><br>

<p id="id00439">"Who shall man them?" asks Hallvard.</p><br>

<p id="id00440">"I will man one of them with my own house-carles, and the freemen
around shall man the other. But still I have found out that
strife has come into the river, and I know not whether ye two
will be able to get away; for they are in the river."</p><br>

<p id="id00441">"Who?" says Hallvard.</p><br>

<p id="id00442">"Brothers twain," says Oliver; "one's name is Vandil, and the
other's Karli, sons of Sjolf the Old, east away out of Gothland."</p><br>

<p id="id00443">Hallvard told Gunnar that Oliver had added some ships to theirs,
and Gunnar was glad at that. They busked them for their voyage
thence, till they were "allboun." Then Gunnar and Hallvard went
before Oliver, and thanked him; he bade them fare warily for the
sake of those brothers.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00444" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id00445" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">(1) A town at the mouth of the Christiania Firth. It was a
 great place for traffic in early times, and was long the
 only mart in the south-east of Norway.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00446" style="margin-top: 3em">30. GUNNAR GOES A-SEA-ROVING</h3>

<p id="id00447">So Gunnar held on out of the river, and he and Kolskegg were both
on board one ship. But Hallvard was on board another. Now, they
see the ships before them, and then Gunnar spoke, and said, "Let
us be ready for anything if they turn towards us! but else let
us have nothing to do with them."</p><br>

<p id="id00448">So they did that, and made all ready on board their ships. The
others parted their ships asunder, and made a fareway between the
ships. Gunnar fared straight on between the ships, but Vandil
caught up a grappling-iron, and cast it between their ships and
Gunnar's ship, and began at once to drag it towards him.</p><br>

<p id="id00449">Oliver had given Gunnar a good sword; Gunnar now drew it, and had
not yet put on his helm. He leapt at once on the forecastle of
Vandil's ship, and gave one man his death-blow. Karli ran his
ship alongside the other side of Gunnar's ship, and hurled a
spear athwart the deck, and aimed at him about the waist. Gunnar
sees this, and turned him about so quickly that no eye could
follow him, and caught the spear with his left hand, and hurled
it back at Karli's ship, and that man got his death who stood
before it. Kolskegg snatched up a grapnel and cast it at Karli's
ship, and the fluke fell inside the hold, and went out through
one of the planks and in rushed the coal-blue sea, and all the
men sprang on board other ships.</p><br>

<p id="id00450">Now Gunnar leapt back to his own ship, and then Hallvard came up,
and now a great battle arose. They saw now that their leader was
unflinching, and every man did as well as he could. Sometimes
Gunnar smote with the sword, and sometimes he hurled the spear,
and many a man had his bane at his hand. Kolskegg backed him
well. As for Karli, he hastened in a ship to his brother Vandil,
and thence they fought that day. During the day Kolskegg took a
rest on Gunnar's ship, and Gunnar sees that. Then he sung a
song ???</p><br>

<p id="id00451">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the eagle ravine-eager,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven of my race, to-day<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better surely hast thou catered,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of gold, than for thyself;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the morn come greedy ravens<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many any a rill of wolf (1) to sup,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thee burning thirst down-beareth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince of battle's Parliament!"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00452">After that Kolskegg took a beaker full of mead, and drank it off,
and went on fighting afterwards; and so it came about that those
brothers sprang up on the ship of Vandil and his brother, and
Kolskegg went on one side, and Gunnar on the other. Against
Gunnar came Vandil, and smote at once at him with his sword, and
the blow fell on his shield. Gunnar gave the shield a twist as
the sword pierced it, and broke it short off at the hilt. Then
Gunnar smote back at Vandil, and three swords seemed to be aloft,
and Vandil could not see how to shun the blow. Then Gunnar cut
both his legs from under him, and at the same time Kolskegg ran
Karli through with a spear. After that they took great war
spoil.</p><br>

<p id="id00453">Thence they held on south to Denmark, and thence east to Smoland,
(2) and had victory wherever they went. They did not come back
in autumn. The next summer they held on to Reval, and fell in
there with sea-rovers, and fought at once, and won the fight.
After that they steered east to Osel,(3) and lay there somewhile
under a ness. There they saw a man coming down from the ness
above them; Gunnar went on shore to meet the man, and they had a
talk. Gunnar asked him his name, and he said it was Tofi.
Gunnar asked again what he wanted.</p><br>

<p id="id00454">"Thee I want to see," says the man. "Two warships lie on the
other side under the ness, and I will tell thee who command them:
two brothers are the captains ??? one's name is Hallgrim, and the
other's Kolskegg. I know them to be mighty men of war; and I
know too that they have such good weapons that the like are not
to be had. Hallgrim has a bill which he had made by seething-
spells; and this is what the spells say, that no weapon shall
give him his death-blow save that bill. That thing follows
it too that it is known at once when a man is to be slain with
that bill, for something sings in it so loudly that it may be
heard along way off ??? such a strong nature has that bill in it."</p><br>

<p id="id00455">Then Gunnar sang a song ???</p><br>

<p id="id00456">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon shall I that spearhead seize,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bold sea-rover slay,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him whose blows on headpiece ring,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaper up of piles of dead.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on Endil's courser (4) bounding,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the sea-depths I will ride,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wretch who spells abuseth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life shall lose in Sigar's storm." (5)<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00457">"Kolskegg has a short sword; that is also the best of weapons.
Force, too, they have ??? a third more than ye. They have also
much goods, and have stowed them away on land, and I know clearly
where they are. But they have sent a spy-ship off the ness, and
they know all about you. Now they are getting themselves ready
as fast as they can; and as soon as they are `boun,' they mean
to run out against you. Now you have either to row away at once,
or to busk yourselves as quickly as ye can; but if ye win the day
then I will lead you to all their store of goods."</p><br>

<p id="id00458">Gunnar gave him a golden finger-ring, and went afterwards to his
men and told them that war-ships lay on the other side of the
ness, "and they know all about us; so let us take to our arms and
busk us well, for now there is gain to be got."</p><br>

<p id="id00459">Then they busked them; and just when they were `boun' they see
ships coming up to them. And now a fight sprung up between them,
and they fought long, and many men fell. Gunnar slew many a man.
Hallgrim and his men leapt on board Gunnar's ship. Gunnar turns
to meet him, and Hallgrim thrust at him with his bill. There was
a boom athwart the ship, and Gunnar leapt nimbly back over it.
Gunnar's shield was just before the boom, and Hallgrim thrust his
bill into it, and through it, and so on into the boom. Gunnar
cut at Hallgrim's arm hard, and lamed the forearm, but the sword
would not bite. Then down fell the bill, and Gunnar seized the
bill, and thrust Hallgrim through, and then sang a song ???</p><br>

<p id="id00460">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slain is he who spoiled the people,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lashing them with flashing steel;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard have I how Hallgrim's magic<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helm-rod forged in foreign land;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All men know, of heart-strings doughty,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How this bill hath come to me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deft in fight, the wolf's dear feeder,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death alone us two shall part."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00461">And that vow Gunnar kept, in that he bore the bill while he
lived. Those namesakes the two Kolskeggs fought together, and
it was a near thing which would get the better of it. Then
Gunnar came up, and gave the other Kolskegg his death-blow.
After that the sea-rovers begged for mercy. Gunnar let them have
that choice, and he let them also count the slain, and take the
goods which the dead men owned, but he gave the others whom he
spared their arms and their clothing, and bade them be off to the
lands that fostered them. So they went off, and Gunnar took all
the goods that were left behind.</p><br>

<p id="id00462">Tofi came to Gunner after the battle, and offered to lead him to
that store of goods which the sea-rovers had stowed away, and
said that it was both better and larger than that which they had
already got.</p><br>

<p id="id00463">Gunnar said he was willing to go, and so he went ashore, and Tofi
before him, to a wood, and Gunnar behind him. They came to a
place where a great heap of wood was piled together. Tofi says
the goods were under there, then they tossed off the wood, and
found under it both gold and silver, clothes, and good weapons.
They bore those goods to the ships, and Gunnar asks Tofi in what
way he wished him to repay him.</p><br>

<p id="id00464">Tofi answered, "I am a Dansk man by race, and I wish thou wouldst
bring me to my kinsfolk."</p><br>

<p id="id00465">Gunnar asks why he was there away east?</p><br>

<p id="id00466">"I was taken by sea-rovers," says Tofi, "and they put me on land
here in Osel, and here I have been ever since."</p><br>

<p id="id00470">Gunnar took Tofi on board, and said to Kolskegg and Hallvard,<br>

"Now we will hold our course for the north lands."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00471">They were well pleased at that, and bade him have his way. So
Gunnar sailed from the east with much goods. He had ten ships,
and ran in with them to Heidarby in Denmark. King Harold Gorm's
son was there up the country, and he was told about Gunnar, and
how too that there was no man his match in all Iceland. He sent
men to him to ask him to come to him, and Gunnar went at once to
see the king, and the king made him a hearty welcome, and sat him
down next to himself. Gunnar was there half a month. The king
made himself sport by letting Gunnar prove himself in divers
feats of strength against his men, and there were none that were
his match even in one feat.</p><br>

<p id="id00472">Then the king said to Gunnar, "It seems to me as though thy peer
is not to be found far or near," and the king offered to get
Gunnar a wife, and to raise him to great power if he would settle
down there.</p><br>

<p id="id00473">Gunnar thanked the king for his offer and said, "I will first of
all sail back to Iceland to see my friends and kinsfolk."</p><br>

<p id="id00474">"Then thou wilt never come back to us," says the king.</p><br>

<p id="id00475">"Fate will settle that, lord," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00476">Gunnar gave the king a good long-ship, and much goods besides,
and the king gave him a robe of honour, and golden-seamed gloves,
and a fillet with a knot of gold on it, and a Russian hat.</p><br>

<p id="id00477">Then Gunnar fared north to Hisingen. Oliver welcomed him with
both hands, and he gave back to Oliver his ships, with their
lading, and said that was his share of the spoil. Oliver took
the goods, and said Gunnar was a good man and true, and bade him
stay with him some while. Hallvard asked Gunnar if he had a mind
to go to see Earl Hacon. Gunnar said that was near his heart,
"for now I am somewhat proved, but then I was not tried at all
when thou badest me do this before."</p><br>

<p id="id00478">After that they fared north to Drontheim to see Earl Hacon, and
he gave Gunnar a hearty welcome, and bade him stay with him that
winter, and Gunnar took that offer, and every man thought him a
man of great worth. At Yule the Earl gave him a gold ring.</p><br>

<p id="id00479">Gunnar set his heart on Bergliota, the Earl's kinswoman, and it
was often to be seen from the Earl's way, that he would have
given her to him to wife if Gunnar had said anything about that.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00480" style="margin-top: 3em">32. GUNNAR COMES OUT TO ICELAND</h3>

<p id="id00481">When the spring came, the Earl asks Gunnar what course he meant
to take. He said he would go to Iceland. The Earl said that had
been a bad year for grain, "and there will be little sailing out
to Iceland, but still thou shalt have meal and timber both in thy
ship."</p><br>

<p id="id00482">Gunnar fitted out his ship as early as he could, and Hallvard
fared out with him and Kolskegg. They came out early in the
summer, and made Arnbael's Oyce before the Thing met.</p><br>

<p id="id00483">Gunnar rode home from the ship, but got men to strip her and lay
her up. But when they came home all men were glad to see them.
They were blithe and merry to their household, nor had their
haughtiness grown while they were away.</p><br>

<p id="id00484">Gunnar asks if Njal were at home; and he was told that he was at
home; then he let them saddle his horse, and those brothers rode
over to Bergthorsknoll.</p><br>

<p id="id00485">Njal was glad at their coming, and begged them to stay there that
night, and Gunnar told him of his voyages.</p><br>

<p id="id00486">Njal said he was a man of the greatest mark, "and thou hast been
much proved; but still thou wilt be more tried hereafter; for
many will envy thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00487">"With all men I would wish to stand well," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00488">"Much bad will happen," said Njal, "and thou wilt always have
some quarrel to ward off."</p><br>

<p id="id00489">"So be it, then," says Gunnar, "so that I have a good ground on
my side."</p><br>

<p id="id00490">"So will it be too," says Njal, "if thou hast not to smart for
others."</p><br>

<p id="id00491">Njal asked Gunnar if he would ride to the Thing. Gunnar said he
was going to ride thither, and asks Njal whether he were going to
ride; but he said he would not ride thither, "and if I had my
will thou wouldst do the like."</p><br>

<p id="id00492">Gunnar rode home, and gave Njal good gifts, and thanked him for
the care he had taken of his goods. Kolskegg urged him on much
to ride to the Thing, saying, "There thy honour will grow, for
many will flock to see thee there."</p><br>

<p id="id00493">"That has been little to my mind," says Gunnar, "to make a show
of myself; but I think it good and right to meet good and worthy
men."</p><br>

<p id="id00494">Hallvard by this time was also come thither, and offered to ride
to the Thing with them.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00495" style="margin-top: 3em">33. GUNNAR'S WOOING</h3>

<p id="id00496">So Gunnar rode, and they all rode. But when they came to the
Thing they were so well arrayed that none could match them in
bravery; and men came out of every booth to wonder at them.
Gunnar rode to the booths of the men of Rangriver, and was there
with his kinsmen. Many men came to see Gunnar, and ask tidings
of him; and he was easy and merry to all men, and told them all
they wished to hear.</p><br>

<p id="id00497">It happened one day that Gunnar went away from the Hill of Laws,
and passed by the booths of the men from Mossfell; then he saw a
woman coming to meet him, and she was in goodly attire; but when
they met she spoke to Gunnar at once. He took her greeting well,
and asks what woman she might be. She told him her name was
Hallgerda, and said she was Hauskuld's daughter, Dalakoll's son.
She spoke up boldly to him, and bade him tell her of his voyages;
but he said he would not gainsay her a talk. Then they sat them
down and talked. She was so clad that she had on a red kirtle,
and had thrown over her a scarlet cloak trimmed with needlework
down to the waist. Her hair came down to her bosom, and was both
fair and full. Gunnar was clad in the scarlet clothes which King
Harold Gorm's son had given him; he had also the gold ring on his
arm which Earl Hacon had given him.</p><br>

<p id="id00498">So they talked long out loud, and at last it came about that he
asked whether she were unmarried. She said, so it was, "and
there are not many who would run the risk of that."</p><br>

<p id="id00499">"Thinkest thou none good enough for thee?"</p><br>

<p id="id00500">"Not that," she says, "but I am said to be hard to please in
husbands."</p><br>

<p id="id00501">"How wouldst thou answer, were I to ask for thee?"</p><br>

<p id="id00502">"That cannot be in thy mind," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00503">"It is though," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00504">"If thou hast any mind that way, go and see my father."</p><br>

<p id="id00505">After that they broke off their talk.</p><br>

<p id="id00506">Gunnar went straightway to the Dalesmen's booths, and met a man
outside the doorway, and asks whether Hauskuld were inside the
booth?</p><br>

<p id="id00507">The man says that he was. Then Gunnar went in, and Hauskuld and
Hrut made him welcome. He sat down between them, and no one
could find out from their talk that there had ever been any
misunderstanding between them. At last Gunnar's speech turned
thither; how these brothers would answer if he asked for
Hallgerda?</p><br>

<p id="id00508">"Well," says Hauskuld, "if that is indeed thy mind."</p><br>

<p id="id00509">Gunnar says that he is in earnest, "but we so parted last time,
that many would think it unlikely that we should ever be bound
together."</p><br>

<p id="id00510">"How thinkest thou, kinsman Hrut?" says Hauskuld.</p><br>

<p id="id00511">Hrut answered, "Methinks this is no even match."</p><br>

<p id="id00512">"How dost thou make that out?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00513">Hrut spoke, "In this wise will I answer thee about this matter,
as is the very truth. Thou art a brisk brave man well to do, and
unblemished; but she is much mixed up with ill report, and I will
not cheat thee in anything."</p><br>

<p id="id00514">"Good go with thee for thy words," says Gunnar, "but still I
shall hold that for true, that the old feud weighs with ye, if ye
will not let me make this match."</p><br>

<p id="id00515">"Not so," says Hrut, "'t is more because I see that thou art
unable to help thyself; but though we make no bargain, we would
still be thy friends."</p><br>

<p id="id00516">"I have talked to her about it," says Gunnar, "and it is not far
from her mind."</p><br>

<p id="id00517">Hrut says, "I know that you have both set your hearts on this
match; and, besides, ye two are those who run the most risk as to
how it turns out."</p><br>

<p id="id00518">Hrut told Gunnar unasked all about Hallgerda's temper, and Gunnar
at first thought that there was more than enough that was
wanting; but at last it came about that they struck a bargain.</p><br>

<p id="id00519">Then Hallgerda was sent for, and they talked over the business
when she was by, and now, as before, they made her betroth
herself. The bridal feast was to be at Lithend, and at first
they were to set about it secretly; but the end after all was
that every one knew of it.</p><br>

<p id="id00520">Gunnar rode home from the Thing, and came to Bergthorsknoll, and
told Njal of the bargain he had made. He took it heavily.</p><br>

<p id="id00521">Gunnar asks Njal why he thought this so unwise?</p><br>

<p id="id00522">"Because from her," says Njal, "will arise all kind of ill if
she comes hither east."</p><br>

<p id="id00523">"Never shall she spoil our friendship," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00524">"Ah! but yet that may come very near," says Njal; "and, besides,
thou wilt have always to make atonement for her."</p><br>

<p id="id00525">Gunnar asked Njal to the wedding, and all those as well whom he
wished should be at it from Njal's house.</p><br>

<p id="id00526">Njal promised to go; and after that Gunnar rode home, and then
rode about the district to bid men to his wedding.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00527" style="margin-top: 3em">34. OF THRAIN SIGFUS' SON</h3>

<p id="id00528">There was a man named Thrain, he was the son of Sigfus, the son
of Sighvat the Red. He kept house at Gritwater on Fleetlithe.
He was Gunnar's kinsman, and a man of great mark. He had to wife
Thorhillda Skaldwife; she had a sharp tongue of her own, and was
given to jeering. Thrain loved her little. He and his wife were
bidden to the wedding, and she and Bergthora, Skarphedinn's
daughter, Njal's wife, waited on the guests with meat and drink.</p><br>

<p id="id00529">Kettle was the name of the second son of Sigfus; he kept house in
the Mark, east of Markfleet. He had to wife Thorgerda, Njal's
daughter. Thorkell was the name of the third son of Sigfus; the
fourth's name was Mord; the fifth's Lambi; the sixth's Sigmund;
the seventh's Sigurd. These were all Gunnar's kinsmen, and great
champions. Gunnar bade them all to the wedding.</p><br>

<p id="id00530">Gunnar had also bidden Valgard the Guileful, and Wolf Aurpriest,
and their sons Runolf and Mord.</p><br>

<p id="id00531">Hauskuld and Hrut came to the wedding with a very great company,
and the sons of Hauskuld, Thorleik, and Olof, were there; the
bride, too, came along with them, and her daughter Thorgerda came
also, and she was one of the fairest of women; she was then
fourteen winters old. Many other women were with her, and
besides there were Thorkatla Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's daughter,
and Njal's two daughters, Thorgerda and Helga.</p><br>

<p id="id00532">Gunnar had already many guests to meet them, and he thus arranged
his men. He sat on the middle of the bench, and on the inside,
away from him, Thrain Sigfus' son, then Wolf Aurpriest, then
Valgard the Guileful, then Mord and Runolf, then the other sons
of Sigfus, Lambi sat outermost of them.</p><br>

<p id="id00533">Next to Gunnar on the outside, away from him, sat Njal, then
Skarphedinn, then Helgi, then Grim, then Hauskuld Njal's son,
then Hafr the Wise, then Ingialld from the Springs, then the sons
of Thorir from Holt away east. Thorir would sit outermost of the
men of mark, for every one was pleased with the seat he got.</p><br>

<p id="id00534">Hauskuld, the bride's father, sat on the middle of the bench over
against Gunnar, but his sons sat on the inside away from him;
Hrut sat on the outside away from Hauskuld, but it is not said
how the others were placed. The bride sat in the middle of the
cross bench on the dais; but on one hand of her sat her daughter
Thorgerda, and on the other Thorkatla Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's
daughter.</p><br>

<p id="id00535">Thorhillda went about waiting on the guests, and Bergthora bore
the meat on the board.</p><br>

<p id="id00536">Now Thrain Sigfus' son kept staring at Thorgerda Glum's daughter;
his wife Thorhillda saw this, and she got wroth, and made a
couplet upon him.</p><br>

<p id="id00537">"Thrain," she says,</p><br>

<p id="id00538">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gaping mouths are no wise good,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goggle eyne are in thy head."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00539">He rose at once up from the board, and said he would put
Thorhillda away. "I will not bear her jibes and jeers any
longer;" and he was so quarrelsome about this, that he would not
be at the feast unless she were driven away. And so it was, that
she went away; and now each man sat in his place, and they drank
and were glad.</p><br>

<p id="id00540">Then Thrain began to speak, "I will not whisper about that which
is in my mind. This I will ask thee, Hauskuld Dalakoll's son,
wilt thou give me to wife Thorgerda, thy kinswoman?"</p><br>

<p id="id00541">"I do not know that," says Hauskuld; "methinks thou art ill
parted from the one thou hadst before. But what kind of man is
he, Gunnar?"</p><br>

<p id="id00542">Gunnar answers, "I will not say aught about the man, because he
is near of kin; but say thou about him, Njal," says Gunnar, "for
all men will believe it."</p><br>

<p id="id00543">Njal spoke, and said, "That is to be said of this man, that the
man is well to do for wealth, and a proper man in all things. A
man, too, of the greatest mark; so that ye may well make this
match with him."</p><br>

<p id="id00544">Then Hauskuld spoke, "What thinkest thou we ought to do, kinsman<br>

Hrut?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00545">"Thou mayst make the match, because it is an even one for her,"
says Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00546">Then they talk about the terms of the bargain, and are soon of
one mind on all points.</p><br>

<p id="id00547">Then Gunnar stands up, and Thrain too, and they go to the cross
bench. Gunnar asked that mother and daughter whether they would
say yes to this bargain. They said they would find no fault with
it, and Hallgerda betrothed her daughter. Then the places of the
women were shifted again, and now Thorhalla sate between the
brides. And now the feast sped on well, and when it was over,
Hauskuld and his company ride west, but the men of Rangriver rode
to their own abode. Gunnar gave many men gifts, and that made
him much liked.</p><br>

<p id="id00548">Hallgerda took the housekeeping under her, and stood up for her
rights in word and deed. Thorgerda took to housekeeping at
Gritwater, and was a good housewife.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00549" style="margin-top: 3em">35. THE VISIT TO BERGTHORSKNOLL</h3>

<p id="id00550">Now it was the custom between Gunnar and Njal, that each made the
other a feast, winter and winter about, for friendship's sake;
and it was Gunnar's turn to go to feast at Njal's. So Gunnar and
Hallgerda set off for Bergthorsknoll, and when they got there
Helgi and his wife were not at home. Njal gave Gunnar and his
wife a hearty welcome, and when they had been there a little
while, Helgi came home with Thorhalla his wife. Then Bergthora
went up to the crossbench, and Thorhalla with her, and Bergthora
said to Hallgerda, "Thou shalt give place to this woman."</p><br>

<p id="id00551">She answered, "To no one will I give place, for I will not be
driven into the corner for any one."</p><br>

<p id="id00552">"I shall rule here," said Bergthora. After that Thorhalla sat
down, and Bergthora went round the table with water to wash the
guests' hands. Then Hallgerda took hold of Bergthora's hand, and
said, "There's not much to choose, though, between you two. Thou
hast hangnails on every finger, and Njal is beardless."</p><br>

<p id="id00553">"That's true," says Bergthora, "yet neither of us finds fault
with the other for it; but Thorwald, thy husband, was not
beardless, and yet thou plottedst his death."</p><br>

<p id="id00554">Then Hallgerda said, "It stands me in little stead to have the
bravest man in Iceland if thou dost not avenge this, Gunnar!"</p><br>

<p id="id00555">He sprang up and strode across away from the board, and said,
"Home I will go, and it were more seemly that thou shouldest
wrangle with those of thine own household, and not under other
men's roofs; but as for Njal, I am his debtor for much honour,
and never will I be egged on by thee like a fool."</p><br>

<p id="id00556">After that they set off home.</p><br>

<p id="id00557">"Mind this Bergthora," said Hallgerda, "that we shall meet
again."</p><br>

<p id="id00558">Bergthora said she should not be better off for that. Gunnar
said nothing at all, but went home to Lithend, and was there at
home all the winter. And now the summer was running on towards
the Great Thing.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00559" style="margin-top: 3em">36. KOL SLEW SWART</h3>

<p id="id00560">Gunnar rode away to the Thing, but before he rode from home he
said to Hallgerda, "Be good now while I am away, and show none of
thine ill temper in anything with which my friends have to do."</p><br>

<p id="id00561">"The trolls take thy friends," says Hallgerda.</p><br>

<p id="id00562">So Gunnar rode to the Thing, and saw it was not good to come to
words with her. Njal rode to the Thing too, and all his sons
with him.</p><br>

<p id="id00563">Now it must be told of what tidings happened at home. Njal and
Gunnar owned a wood in common at Redslip; they had not shared the
wood, but each was wont to hew in it as he needed, and neither
said a word to the other about that. Hallgerda's grieve's (1)
name was Kol; he had been with her long, and was one of the worst
of men. There was a man named Swart; he was Njal's and
Bergthora's housecarle; they were very fond of him. Now
Bergthora told him that he must go up into Redslip and hew wood;
but she said, "I will get men to draw home the wood."</p><br>

<p id="id00564">He said he would do the work she set him to win; and so he went
up into Redslip, and was to be there a week.</p><br>

<p id="id00565">Some gangrel men came to Lithend from the east across Markfleet,
and said that Swart had been in Redslip, and hewn wood, and done
a deal of work.</p><br>

<p id="id00566">"So," says Hallgerda, "Bergthora must mean to rob me in many
things, but I'll take care that he does not hew again."</p><br>

<p id="id00567">Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, heard that, and said, "There have been
good housewives before now, though they never set their hearts on
manslaughter."</p><br>

<p id="id00568">Now the night wore away, and early next morning Hallgerda came to
speak to Kol, and said, "I have thought of some work for thee;"
and with that she put weapons into his hands, and went on to say
??? "Fare thou to Redslip; there wilt thou find Swart."</p><br>

<p id="id00569">"What shall I do to him?" he says.</p><br>

<p id="id00570">"Askest thou that, when thou art the worst of men?" she says.<br>

"Thou shalt kill him."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00571">"I can get that done," he says, "but 'tis more likely that I
shall lose my own life for it."</p><br>

<p id="id00572">"Everything grows big in thy eyes," she says, "and thou behavest
ill to say this after I have spoken up for thee in everything. I
must get another man to do this if thou darest not."</p><br>

<p id="id00573">He took the axe, and was very wroth, and takes a horse that
Gunnar owned, and rides now till he comes east of Markfleet.
There he got off and bided in the wood, till they had carried
down the firewood, and Swart was left alone behind. Then Kol
sprang on him, and said, "More folk can hew great strokes than
thou alone;" and so he laid the axe on his head, and smote him
his death-blow, and rides home afterwards, and tells Hallgerda of
the slaying.</p><br>

<p id="id00574">She said, "I shall take such good care of thee, that no harm
shall come to thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00575">"May be so," says he, "but I dreamt all the other way as I slept
ere I did the deed."</p><br>

<p id="id00576">Now they come up into the wood, and find Swart slain, and bear
him home. Hallgerda sent a man to Gunnar at the Thing to tell
him of the slaying. Gunnar said no hard words at first of
Hallgerda to the messenger, and men knew not at first whether he
thought well or ill of it. A little after he stood up, and bade
his men go with him: they did so, and fared to Njal's booth.
Gunnar sent a man to fetch Njal, and begged him to come out.
Njal went out at once, and he and Gunnar fell a-talking, and
Gunnar said, "I have to tell thee of the slaying of a man, and my
wife and my grieve Kol were those who did it; but Swart, thy
housecarle, fell before them."</p><br>

<p id="id00577">Njal held his peace while he told him the whole story. Then Njal
spoke, "Thou must take heed not to let her have her way in
everything."</p><br>

<p id="id00578">Gunnar said, "Thou thyself shalt settle the terms."</p><br>

<p id="id00579">Njal spoke again, "'Twill be hard work for thee to atone for all
Hallgerda's mischief; and somewhere else there will be a broader
trail to follow than this which we two now have a share in, and
yet, even here there will be much awanting before all be well;
and herein we shall need to bear in mind the friendly words that
passed between us of old; and something tells me that thou wilt
come well out of it, but still thou wilt be sore tried."</p><br>

<p id="id00580">Then Njal took the award into his own hands from Gunnar, and
said, "I will not push this matter to the uttermost; thou shalt
pay twelve ounces of silver; but I will add this to my award,
that if anything happens from our homestead about which thou hast
to utter an award, thou wilt not be less easy in thy terms."</p><br>

<p id="id00581">Gunnar paid up the money out of hand, and rode home afterwards.
Njal, too, came home from the Thing, and his sons. Bergthora saw
the money, and said, "This is very justly settled; but even as
much money shall be paid for Kol as time goes on."</p><br>

<p id="id00582">Gunnar came home from the Thing and blamed Hallgerda. She said,
better men lay unatoned in many places. Gunnar said, she might
have her way in beginning a quarrel, "but how the matter is to be
settled rests with me."</p><br>

<p id="id00583">Hallgerda was for ever chattering of Swart's slaying, but
Bergthora liked that ill. Once Njal and her sons went up to
Thorolfsfell to see about the house-keeping there, but that
selfsame day this thing happened when Bergthora was out of doors:
she sees a man ride up to the house on a black horse. She stayed
there and did not go in, for she did not know the man. That man
had a spear in his hand, and was girded with a short sword. She
asked this man his name.</p><br>

<p id="id00584">"Atli is my name," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00585">She asked whence he came.</p><br>

<p id="id00586">"I am an Eastfirther," he says.</p><br>

<p id="id00587">"Whither shalt thou go?" she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00588">"I am a homeless man," says he, "and I thought to see Njal and<br>

Skarphedinn, and know if they would take me in."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00589">"What work is handiest to thee?" says she.</p><br>

<p id="id00590">"I am a man used to field-work," he says, "and many things else
come very handy to me; but I will not hide from thee that I am a
man of hard temper, and it has been many a man's lot before now
to bind up wounds at my hand."</p><br>

<p id="id00591">"I do not blame thee," she says, "though thou art no milksop."</p><br>

<p id="id00592">Atli said, "Hast thou any voice in things here?"</p><br>

<p id="id00593">"I am Njal's wife," she says, "and I have as much to say to our
housefolk as he."</p><br>

<p id="id00594">"Wilt thou take me in then?" says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00595">"I will give thee thy choice of that," says she. "If thou wilt
do all the work that I set before thee, and that, though I wish
to send thee where a man's life is at stake."</p><br>

<p id="id00596">"Thou must have so many men at thy beck," says he, "that thou
wilt not need me for such work."</p><br>

<p id="id00597">"That I will settle as I please," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00598">"We will strike a bargain on these terms," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00599">Then she took him into the household. Njal and his sons came
home and asked Bergthora what man that might be?</p><br>

<p id="id00600">"He is thy house-carle," she says, "and I took him in." Then she
went on to say he was no sluggard at work.</p><br>

<p id="id00601">"He will be a great worker enough, I daresay," says Njal, "but I
do not know whether he will be such a good worker."</p><br>

<p id="id00602">Skarphedinn was good to Atli.</p><br>

<p id="id00603">Njal and his sons ride to the Thing in the course of the summer;<br>

Gunnar was also at the Thing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00604">Njal took out a purse of money.</p><br>

<p id="id00605">"What money is that, father?"</p><br>

<p id="id00606">"Here is the money that Gunnar paid me for our housecarle last
summer."</p><br>

<p id="id00607">"That will come to stand thee in some stead," says Skarphedinn,
and smiled as he spoke.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00608" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<h3 id="id00610" style="margin-top: 3em">37. THE SLAYING OF KOL, WHOM ATLI SLEW</h3>

<p id="id00611">Now we must take up the story and say, that Atli asked Bergthora
what work he should do that day?</p><br>

<p id="id00612">"I have thought of some work for thee," she says; "thou shalt go
and look for Kol until thou find him; for now shalt thou slay him
this very day, if thou wilt do my will."</p><br>

<p id="id00613">"This work is well fitted," says Atli, "for each of us two are
bad fellows; but still I will so lay myself out for him that one
or other of us shall die."</p><br>

<p id="id00614">"Well mayst thou fare," she says, "and thou shalt not do this
deed for nothing."</p><br>

<p id="id00615">He took his weapons and his horse, and rode up to Fleetlithe, and
there met men who were coming down from Lithend. They were at
home east in the Mark. They asked Atli whither he meant to go?
He said he was riding to look for an old jade. They said that
was a small errand for such a workman, "but still 'twould be
better to ask those who have been about last night."</p><br>

<p id="id00616">"Who are they?" says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00617">"Killing-Kol," say they, "Hallgerda's house-carle, fared from the
fold just now, and has been awake all night."</p><br>

<p id="id00618">"I do not know whether I dare to meet him," says Atli, "he is
bad-tempered, and may be that I shall let another's wound be my
warning."</p><br>

<p id="id00619">"Thou bearest that look beneath the brows as though thou wert no
coward," they said, and showed him where Kol was.</p><br>

<p id="id00620">Then he spurred his horse and rides fast, and when he meets Kol,<br>

Atli said to him, "Go the pack-saddle bands well," says Atli.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00621">"That's no business of thine, worthless fellow, nor of any one
else whence thou comest."</p><br>

<p id="id00622">Atli said, "Thou hast something behind that is earnest work, but
that is to die."</p><br>

<p id="id00623">After that Atli thrust at him with his spear, and struck him
about his middle. Kol swept at him with his axe, but missed him,
and fell off his horse, and died at once.</p><br>

<p id="id00624">Atli rode till he met some of Hallgerda's workmen, and said, "Go
ye up to the horse yonder, and look to Kol, for he has fallen
off, and is dead."</p><br>

<p id="id00625">"Hast thou slain him?" say they.</p><br>

<p id="id00626">"Well, 'twill seem to Hallgerda as though he has not fallen by
his own hand."</p><br>

<p id="id00627">After that Atli rode home and told Bergthora; she thanked him for
this deed, and for the words which he had spoken about it.</p><br>

<p id="id00628">"I do not know," says he, "what Njal will think of this."</p><br>

<p id="id00629">"He will take it well upon his hands," she says, "and I will tell
thee one thing as a token of it, that he has carried away with
him to the Thing the price of that thrall which we took last
spring, and that money will now serve for Kol; but though peace
be made thou must still be ware of thyself, for Hallgerda will
keep no peace."</p><br>

<p id="id00630">"Wilt thou send at all a man to Njal to tell him of the slaying?"</p><br>

<p id="id00631">"I will not," she says, "I should like it better that Kol were
unatoned."</p><br>

<p id="id00632">Then they stopped talking about it.</p><br>

<p id="id00633">Hallgerda was told of Kol's slaying, and of the words that Atli
had said. She said Atli should be paid off for them. She sent a
man to the Thing to tell Gunnar of Kol's slaying; he answered
little or nothing, and sent a man to tell Njal. He too made no
answer, but Skarphedinn said, "Thralls are men of more mettle
than of yore; they used to fly at each other and fight, and no
one thought much harm of that; but now they will do naught but
kill," and as he said this he smiled.</p><br>

<p id="id00634">Njal pulled down the purse of money which hung up in the booth,
and went out: his sons went with him to Gunnar's booth.</p><br>

<p id="id00635">Skarphedinn said to a man who was in the doorway of the booth,<br>

"Say thou to Gunnar that my father wants to see him."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00636">He did so, and Gunnar went out at once and gave Njal a hearty
welcome. After that they began to talk.</p><br>

<p id="id00637">"'Tis ill done," says Njal, "that my housewife should have broken
the peace, and let thy house-carle be slain."</p><br>

<p id="id00638">"She shall not have blame for that," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00639">"Settle the award thyself," says Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00640">"So I will do," says Gunnar, "and I value those two men at an
even price, Swart and Kol. Thou shalt pay me twelve ounces in
silver."</p><br>

<p id="id00641">Njal took the purse of money and handed it to Gunnar. Gunnar
knew the money, and saw it was the same that he had paid Njal.
Njal went away to his booth, and they were just as good friends
as before. When Njal came home, he blamed Bergthora; but she
said she would never give way to Hallgerda. Hallgerda was very
cross with Gunnar, because he had made peace for Kol's slaying.
Gunnar told her he would never break with Njal or his sons, and
she flew into a great rage; but Gunnar took no heed of that, and
so they sat for that year, and nothing noteworthy happened.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00642" style="margin-top: 3em">38. THE KILLING OF ATLI THE THRALL</h3>

<p id="id00643">Next spring Njal said to Atli, "I wish that thou wouldst change
thy abode to the east firths, so that Hallgerda may not put an
end to thy life?"</p><br>

<p id="id00644">"I am not afraid of that," says Atli, "and I will willingly stay
at home if I have the choice."</p><br>

<p id="id00645">"Still that is less wise," says Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00646">"I think it better to lose my life in thy house than to change my
master; but this I will beg of thee, if I am slain, that a
thrall's price shall not be paid for me."</p><br>

<p id="id00647">"Thou shalt be atoned for as a free man; but perhaps Bergthora
will make thee a promise which she will fulfil, that revenge, man
for man, shall be taken for thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00648">Then he made up his mind to be a hired servant there.</p><br>

<p id="id00649">Now it must be told of Hallgerda that she sent a man west to
Bearfirth, to fetch Brynjolf the Unruly, her kinsman. He was a
base son of Swan, and he was one of the worst of men. Gunnar
knew nothing about it. Hallgerda said he was well fitted to be a
grieve. So Brynjolf came from the west, and Gunnar asked what he
was to do there? He said he was going to stay there.</p><br>

<p id="id00650">"Thou wilt not better our household," says Gunnar, "after what
has been told me of thee, but I will not turn away any of
Hallgerda's kinsmen, whom she wishes to be with her."</p><br>

<p id="id00651">Gunnar said little, but was not unkind to him, and so things went
on till the Thing. Gunnar rides to the Thing and Kolskegg rides
too, and when they came to the Thing they and Njal met, for he
and his sons were at the Thing, and all went well with Gunnar and
them.</p><br>

<p id="id00652">Bergthora said to Atli, "Go thou up into Thorolfsfell and work
there a week."</p><br>

<p id="id00653">So he went up thither, and was there on the sly, and burnt
charcoal in the wood.</p><br>

<p id="id00654">Hallgerda said to Brynjolf, "I have been told Atli is not at
home, and he must be winning work on Thorolfsfell."</p><br>

<p id="id00655">"What thinkest thou likeliest that he is working at," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00656">"At something in the wood," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00657">"What shall I do to him?" he asks.</p><br>

<p id="id00658">"Thou shalt kill him," says she.</p><br>

<p id="id00659">He was rather slow in answering her, and Hallgerda said, "'Twould
grow less in Thiostolf's eyes to kill Atli if he were alive."</p><br>

<p id="id00660">"Thou shalt have no need to goad me on much more," he says, and
then he seized his weapons, and takes his horse and mounts, and
rides to Thorolfsfell. There he saw a great reek of coalsmoke
east of the homestead, so he rides thither, and gets off his
horse and ties him up, but he goes where the smoke was thickest.
Then he sees where the charcoal pit is, and a man stands by it.
He saw that he had thrust his spear in the ground by him.
Brynjolf goes along with the smoke right up to him, but he was
eager at his work, and saw him not. Brynjolf gave him a stroke
on the head with his axe, and he turned so quick round that
Brynjolf loosed his hold of the axe, and Atli grasped the spear,
and hurled it after him. Then Brynjolf cast himself down on the
ground, but the spear flew away over him.</p><br>

<p id="id00661">"Lucky for thee that I was not ready for thee," says Atli, "but
now Hallgerda will be well pleased, for thou wilt tell her of my
death; but it is a comfort to know that thou wilt have the same
fate soon; but come now take thy axe which has been here."</p><br>

<p id="id00662">He answered him never a word, nor did he take the axe before he
was dead. Then he rode up to the house on Thorolfsfell, and told
of the slaying, and after that rode home and told Hallgerda. She
sent men to Bergthorsknoll, and let them tell Bergthora that now
Kol's slaying was paid for.</p><br>

<p id="id00663">After that Hallgerda sent a man to the Thing to tell Gunnar of<br>

Atli's killing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00664">Gunnar stood up, and Kolskegg with him, and Kolskegg said,<br>

"Unthrifty will Hallgerda's kinsmen be to thee."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00665">Then they go to see Njal, and Gunnar said, "I have to tell thee
of Atli's killing." He told him also who slew him, and went on,
"And now I will bid thee atonement for the deed, and thou shalt
make the award thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id00666">Njal said, "We two have always meant never to come to strife
about anything; but still I cannot make him out a thrall."</p><br>

<p id="id00667">Gunnar said that was all right, and stretched out his hand.</p><br>

<p id="id00668">Njal named his witnesses, and they made peace on those terms.</p><br>

<p id="id00669">Skarphedinn said, "Hallgerda does not let our housecarles die
of old age."</p><br>

<p id="id00670">Gunnar said, "Thy mother will take care that blow goes for blow
between the houses."</p><br>

<p id="id00671">"Ay, ay," says Njal, "there will be enough of that work."</p><br>

<p id="id00672">After that Njal fixed the price at a hundred in silver, but
Gunnar paid it down at once. Many who stood by said that the
award was high; Gunnar got wroth, and said that a full atonement
was often paid for those who were no brisker men than Atli.</p><br>

<p id="id00673">With that they rode home from the Thing.</p><br>

<p id="id00674">Bergthora said to Njal when she saw the money, "Thou thinkest
thou hast fulfilled thy promise, but now my promise is still
behind."</p><br>

<p id="id00675">"There is no need that thou shouldst fulfil it," says Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00676">"Nay," says she, "thou hast guessed it would be so; and so it
shall be."</p><br>

<p id="id00677">Hallgerda said to Gunnar, "Hast thou paid a hundred in silver for<br>

Atli's slaying, and made him a free man?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00678">"He was free before," says Gunnar, "and besides, I will not make<br>

Njal's household outlaws who have forfeited their rights."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00679">"There's not a pin to choose between you," she said, "for both of
you are so blate?"</p><br>

<p id="id00680">"That's as things prove," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00681">Then Gunnar was for a long time very short with her, till she
gave way to him; and now all was still for the rest of that year;
in the spring Njal did not increase his household, and now men
ride to the Thing about summer.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00682" style="margin-top: 3em">39. THE SLAYING OF BRYNJOLF THE UNRULY</h3>

<p id="id00683">There was a man named Thord, he was surnamed Freedmanson.
Sigtrygg was his father's name, and he had been the freedman of
Asgerd, and he was drowned in Markfleet. That was why Thord was
with Njal afterwards. He was a tall man and a strong, and he had
fostered all Njal's sons. He had set his heart on Gudfinna
Thorolf's daughter, Njal's kinswoman; she was housekeeper at home
there, and was then with child.</p><br>

<p id="id00684">Now Bergthora came to talk with Thord Freedmanson; she said,<br>

"Thou shalt go to kill Brynjolf, Hallgerda's kinsman."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00685">"I am no man-slayer," he says, "but still I will do whatever thou
wilt."</p><br>

<p id="id00686">"This is my will," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00687">After that he went up to Lithend, and made them call Hallgerda
out, and asked where Brynjolf might be.</p><br>

<p id="id00688">"What's thy will with him," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00689">"I want him to tell me where he has hidden Atli's body; I have
heard say that he has buried it badly."</p><br>

<p id="id00690">She pointed to him and said he was down yonder in Acretongue.</p><br>

<p id="id00691">"Take heed," says Thord, "that the same thing does not befall him
as befell Atli."</p><br>

<p id="id00692">"Thou art no man-slayer," she says, "and so naught will come of
it even if ye two do meet."</p><br>

<p id="id00693">"Never have I seen man's blood, nor do I know how I should feel
if I did," he says, and gallops out of the "town" and down to
Acretongue.</p><br>

<p id="id00694">Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, had heard their talk.</p><br>

<p id="id00695">"Thou goadest his mind much, Hallgerda," she says, "but I think
him a dauntless man, and that thy kinsman will find."</p><br>

<p id="id00696">They met on the beaten way, Thord and Brynjolf; and Thord said,<br>

"Guard thee, Brynjolf, for I will do no dastard's deed by thee."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00697">Brynjolf rode at Thord, and smote at him with his axe. He smote
at him at the same time with his axe, and hewed in sunder the
haft just above Brynjolf's hands, and then hewed at him at once a
second time, and struck him on the collar-bone, and the blow went
straight into his trunk. Then he fell from horseback, and was
dead on the spot.</p><br>

<p id="id00698">Thord met Hallgerda's herdsman, and gave out the slaying as done
by his hand, and said where he lay, and bade him tell Hallgerda
of the slaying. After that he rode home to Bergthorsknoll, and
told Bergthora of the slaying, and other people too.</p><br>

<p id="id00699">"Good luck go with thy hands," she said.</p><br>

<p id="id00700">The herdsman told Hallgerda of the slaying; she was snappish at
it, and said much ill would come of it, if she might have her
way.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00701" style="margin-top: 3em">40. GUNNAR AND NJAL MAKE PEACE ABOUT BRYNJOLF'S SLAYING</h3>

<p id="id00702">Now these tidings come to the Thing, and Njal made them tell him
the tale thrice, and then he said, "More men now become man-
slayers than I weened."</p><br>

<p id="id00703">Skarphedinn spoke, "That man, though, must have been twice fey,"
he says, "who lost his life by our foster-father's hand, who has
never seen man's blood. And many would think that we brothers
would sooner have done this deed with the turn of temper that we
have."</p><br>

<p id="id00704">"Scant space wilt thou have," says Njal, "ere the like befalls
thee; but need will drive thee to it."</p><br>

<p id="id00705">Then they went to meet Gunnar, and told him of the slaying.
Gunnar spoke and said that was little man-scathe, "but yet he was
a free man."</p><br>

<p id="id00706">Njal offered to make peace at once, and Gunnar said yes, and he
was to settle the terms himself. He made his award there and
then, and laid it at one hundred in silver. Njal paid down the
money on the spot, and they were at peace after that.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00707" style="margin-top: 3em">41. SIGMUND COMES OUT TO ICELAND</h3>

<p id="id00708">There was a man whose name was Sigmund. He was the son of Lambi,
the son of Sighvat the Red. He was a great voyager, and a comely
and a courteous man; tall too, and strong. He was a man of proud
spirit, and a good skald, and well trained in most feats of
strength. He was noisy and boisterous, and given to jibes and
mocking. He made the land east in Homfirth. Skiolld was the
name of his fellow-traveller; he was a Swedish man, and ill to do
with. They took horse and rode from the east out of Hornfirth,
and did not draw bridle before they came to Lithend, in the
Fleetlithe. Gunnar gave them a hearty welcome, for the bonds of
kinship were close between them. Gunnar begged Sigmund to stay
there that winter, and Sigmund said he would take the offer if
Skiolld his fellow might be there too.</p><br>

<p id="id00709">"Well, I have been so told about him," said Gunnar, "that he is
no betterer of thy temper; but as it is, thou rather needest to
have it bettered. This, too, is a bad house to stay at, and I
would just give both of you a bit of advice, my kinsman, not to
fire up at the egging on of my wife Hallgerda; for she takes much
in hand that is far from my will."</p><br>

<p id="id00710">"His hands are clean who warns another," says Sigmund.</p><br>

<p id="id00711">"Then mind the advice given thee," says Gunnar, "for thou art
sure to be sore tried; and go along always with me, and lean upon
my counsel."</p><br>

<p id="id00712">After that they were in Gunnar's company. Hallgerda was good to
Sigmund; and it soon came about that things grew so warm that she
loaded him with money, and tended him no worse than her own
husband; and many talked about that, and did not know what lay
under it.</p><br>

<p id="id00713">One day Hallgerda said to Gunnar, "It is not good to be content
with that hundred in silver which thou tookest for my kinsman
Brynjolf. I shall avenge him if I may," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00714">Gunnar said he had no mind to bandy words with her, and went
away. He met Kolskegg, and said to him, "Go and see Njal; and
tell him that Thord must be ware of himself though peace has been
made for, methinks, there is faithlessness somewhere."</p><br>

<p id="id00715">He rode off and told Njal, but Njal told Thord, and Kolskegg rode
home, and Njal thanked them for their faithfulness.</p><br>

<p id="id00716">Once on a time they two were out in the "town," Njal and Thord; a
he-goat was wont to go up and down in the "town," and no one was
allowed to drive him away. Then Thord spoke and said, "Well,
this is a wondrous thing!"</p><br>

<p id="id00717">"What is it that thou see'st that seems after a wondrous
fashion?" says Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00718">"Methinks the goat lies here in the hollow, and he is all one
gore of blood."</p><br>

<p id="id00719">Njal said that there was no goat there, nor anything else.</p><br>

<p id="id00720">"What is it then?" says Thord.</p><br>

<p id="id00721">"Thou must be a `fey' man," says Njal, "and thou must have seen
the fetch that follows thee, and now be ware of thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id00722">"That will stand me in no stead," says Thord, "if death is doomed
for me."</p><br>

<p id="id00723">Then Hallgerda came to talk with Thrain Sigfus' son, and said, "I
would think thee my son-in-law indeed," she says, "if thou
slayest Thord Freedmanson."</p><br>

<p id="id00724">"I will not do that," he says, "for then I shall have the wrath
of my kinsman Gunnar; and besides, great things hang on this
deed, for this slaying would soon be avenged."</p><br>

<p id="id00725">"Who will avenge it?" she asks; "is it the beardless carle?"</p><br>

<p id="id00726">"Not so," says he, "his sons will avenge it."</p><br>

<p id="id00727">After that they talked long and low, and no man knew what counsel
they took together.</p><br>

<p id="id00728">Once it happened that Gunnar was not at home, but those
companions were. Thrain had come in from Gritwater, and then he
and they and Hallgerda sat out of doors and talked. Then
Hallgerda said, "This have ye two brothers in arms, Sigmund and
Skiolld, promised to slay Thord Freedmanson; but Thrain thou hast
promised me that thou wouldst stand by them when they did the
deed."</p><br>

<p id="id00729">They all acknowledged that they had given her this promise.</p><br>

<p id="id00730">"Now I will counsel you how to do it," she says: "Ye shall ride
east into Homfirth after your goods, and come home about the
beginning of the Thing, but if ye are at home before it begins,
Gunnar will wish that ye should ride to the Thing with him. Njal
will be at the Thing and his sons and Gunnar, but then ye two
shall slay Thord."</p><br>

<p id="id00731">They all agreed that this plan should be carried out. After that
they busked them east to the Firth, and Gunnar was not aware of
what they were about, and Gunnar rode to the Thing. Njal sent
Thord Freedmanson away east under Eyjafell, and bade him be away
there one night. So he went east, but he could not get back from
the east, for the Fleet had risen so high that it could not be
crossed on horseback ever so far up. Njal waited for him one
night, for he had meant him to have ridden with him; and Njal
said to Bergthora that she must send Thord to the Thing as soon
as ever he came home. Two nights after, Thord came from the
east, and Bergthora told him that he must ride to the Thing, "But
first thou shalt ride up into Thorolfsfell and see about the farm
there, and do not be there longer than one or two nights."</p><br>

<h3 id="id00732" style="margin-top: 3em">42. THE SLAYING OF THORD FREEDMANSON</h3>

<p id="id00733">Then Sigmund came from the east and those companions. Hallgerda
told them that Thord was at home, but that he was to ride
straightway to the Thing after a few nights' space. "Now ye will
have a fair chance at him," she says, "but if this goes off, ye
will never get nigh him." Men came to Lithend from Thorolfsfell,
and told Hallgerda that Thord was there. Hallgerda went to
Thrain Sigfus' son, and his companions, and said to him, "Now is
Thord on Thorolfsfell, and now your best plan is to fall on him
and kill him as he goes home."</p><br>

<p id="id00734">"That we will do," says Sigmund. So they went out, and took
their weapons and horses and rode on the way to meet him.
Sigmund said to Thrain, "Now thou shalt have nothing to do with
it; for we shall not need all of us."</p><br>

<p id="id00735">"Very well, so I will," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id00736">Then Thord rode up to them a little while after, and Sigmund said
to him, "Give thyself up," he says, "for now shalt thou die."</p><br>

<p id="id00737">"That shall not be," says Thord, "come thou to single combat with
me."</p><br>

<p id="id00738">"That shall not be either," says Sigmund; "we will make the most
of our numbers; but it is not strange that Skarphedinn is strong,
for it is said that a fourth of a foster-child's strength comes
from the foster-father."</p><br>

<p id="id00739">"Thou wilt feel the force of that," says Thord, "for Skarphedinn
will avenge me."</p><br>

<p id="id00740">After that they fall on him, and he breaks a spear of each of
them, so well did he guard himself. Then Skiolld cut off his
hand, and he still kept them off with his other hand for some
time, till Sigmund thrust him through. Then he fell dead to
earth. They drew over him turf and stones; and Thrain said, "We
have won an ill work, and Njal's sons will take this slaying ill
when they hear of it."</p><br>

<p id="id00741">They ride home and tell Hallgerda. She was glad to hear of the
slaying, but Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, said, "It is said `but a
short while is hand fain of blow,' and so it will be here; but
still Gunnar will set thee free from this matter. But if
Hallgerda makes thee take another fly in thy mouth, then that
will be thy bane."</p><br>

<p id="id00742">Hallgerda sent a man to Bergthorsknoll, to tell the slaying, and
another man to the Thing, to tell it to Gunnar. Bergthora said
she would not fight against Hallgerda with ill words about such a
matter; "That," quoth she, "would be no revenge for so great a
quarrel."</p><br>

<h3 id="id00743" style="margin-top: 3em">43. NJAL AND GUNNAR MAKE PEACE FOR THE SLAYING OF THORD</h3>

<p id="id00744">But when the messenger came to the Thing to tell Gunnar of the
slaying, then Gunnar said, "This has happened ill, and no tidings
could come to my ears which I should think worse; but yet we will
now go at once and see Njal. I still hope he may take it well,
though he be sorely tried."</p><br>

<p id="id00745">So they went to see Njal, and called him to come out and talk to
them. He went out at once to meet Gunnar, and they talked, nor
were there any more men by at first than Kolskegg.</p><br>

<p id="id00746">"Hard tidings have I to tell thee," says Gunnar; "the slaying of
Thord Freedmanson, and I wish to offer thee selfdoom for the
slaying."</p><br>

<p id="id00747">Njal held his peace some while, and then said, "That is well
offered, and I will take it; but yet it is to be looked for that
I shall have blame from my wife or from my sons for that, for it
will mislike them much; but still I will run the risk, for I know
that I have to deal with a good man and true; nor do I wish that
any breach should arise in our friendship on my part."</p><br>

<p id="id00748">"Wilt thou let thy sons be by, pray?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00749">"I will not," says Njal, "for they will not break the peace which
I make, but if they stand by while we make it they will not pull
well together with us."</p><br>

<p id="id00750">"So it shall be," says Gunnar. "See thou to it alone."</p><br>

<p id="id00751">Then they shook one another by the hand, and made peace well and
quickly.</p><br>

<p id="id00752">Then Njal said, "The award that I make is two hundred in silver,
and that thou wilt think much."</p><br>

<p id="id00753">"I do not think it too much," says Gunnar, and went home to his
booth.</p><br>

<p id="id00754">Njal's sons came home, and Skarphedinn asked whence that great
sum of money came, which his father held in his hand.</p><br>

<p id="id00755">Njal said, "I tell you of your foster-father's Thord's slaying,
and we two, Gunnar and I, have now made peace in the matter, and
he has paid an atonement for him as for two men."</p><br>

<p id="id00756">"Who slew him?" says Skarphedinn.</p><br>

<p id="id00757">"Sigmund and Skiolld, but Thrain was standing near too," says<br>

Njal.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00758">"They thought they had need of much strength," says Skarphedinn,
and sang a song ???</p><br>

<p id="id00759">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold in deeds of derring-do,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burdeners of ocean's steeds,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength enough it seems they needed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All to slay a single man;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shall we our hands uplift?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We who brandish burnished steel ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Famous men erst reddened weapons,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When? if now we quiet sit?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00760">"Yes! when shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?"</p><br>

<p id="id00761">"That will not be long off," says Njal, "and then thou shalt not
be baulked; but still, methinks, I set great store on your not
breaking this peace that I have made."</p><br>

<p id="id00762">"Then we will not break it," says Skarphedinn, "but if anything
arises between us, then we will bear in mind the old feud."</p><br>

<p id="id00763">"Then I will ask you to spare no one," says Njal.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00764" style="margin-top: 3em">44. SIGMUND MOCKS NJAL AND HIS SONS</h3>

<p id="id00765">Now men ride home from the Thing; and when Gunnar came home, he
said to Sigmund, "Thou art a more unlucky man than I thought, and
turnest thy good gifts to thine own ill. But still I have made
peace for thee with Njal and his sons; and now, take care that
thou dost not let another fly come into thy mouth. Thou art not
at all after my mind, thou goest about with jibes and jeers, with
scorn and mocking; but that is not my turn of mind. That is why
thou gettest on so well with Hallgerda, because ye two have your
minds more alike."</p><br>

<p id="id00766">Gunnar scolded him a long time, and he answered him well, and
said he would follow his counsel more for the time to come than
he had followed it hitherto. Gunnar told him then they might get
on together. Gunnar and Njal kept up their friendship though the
rest of their people saw little of one another. It happened once
that some gangrel women came to Lithend from Bergthorsknoll; they
were great gossips and rather spiteful tongued. Hallgerda had a
bower, and sate often in it, and there sate with her her daughter
Thorgerda, and there too were Thrain and Sigmund, and a crowd of
women. Gunnar was not there, nor Kolskegg. These gangrel women
went into the bower, and Hallgerda greeted them, and made room
for them; then she asked them for news, but they had none to
tell. Hallgerda asked where they had been overnight; they said
at Bergthorsknoll.</p><br>

<p id="id00767">"What was Njal doing?" she says.</p><br>

<p id="id00768">"He was hard at work sitting still," they said.</p><br>

<p id="id00769">"What were Njal's sons doing?" she says; "they think themselves
men at any rate."</p><br>

<p id="id00770">"Tall men they are in growth," they say, "but as yet they are all
untried; Skarphedinn whetted an axe, Grim fitted a spearhead to
the shaft, Helgi riveted a hilt on a sword, Hauskuld strengthened
the handle of a shield."</p><br>

<p id="id00771">"They must be bent on some great deed," says Hallgerda.</p><br>

<p id="id00772">"We do not know that," they say.</p><br>

<p id="id00773">"What were Njal's house-carles doing?" she asks.</p><br>

<p id="id00774">"We don't know what some of them were doing, but one was carting
dung up the hill-side."</p><br>

<p id="id00775">"What good was there in doing that?" she asks.</p><br>

<p id="id00776">"He said it made the swathe better there than anywhere else,"
they reply. "Witless now is Njal," says Hallgerda, "though he
knows how to give counsel on everything."</p><br>

<p id="id00777">"How so?" they ask.</p><br>

<p id="id00778">"I will only bring forward what is true to prove it," says she;
"why doesn't he make them cart dung over his beard that he may be
like other men? Let us call him `the Beardless Carle': but his
sons we will call `Dung-beardlings'; and now do pray give some
stave about them, Sigmund, and let us get some good by thy gift
of song."</p><br>

<p id="id00779">"I am quite ready to do that," says he, and sang these verses:</p><br>

<p id="id00780">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady proud with hawk in hand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prithee why should dungbeard boys,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reft of reason, dare to hammer<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shalt not shun this ditty shameful<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I shape upon them now.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He the beardless carle shall listen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I lash him with abuse,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loon at whom our stomachs sicken,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon shall bear these words of scorn;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far too nice for such base fellows<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the name my bounty gives,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Een my muse her help refuses,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making mirth of dungbeard boys.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here I find a nickname fitting<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those noisome dungbeard boys, ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loath am I to break my bargain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linked with such a noble man ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knit we all our taunts together ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known to me is mind of man ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call we now with outburst common,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, that churl, the beardless carle."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00783">"Thou art a jewel indeed," says Hallgerda; "how yielding thou art
to what I ask!"</p><br>

<p id="id00784">Just then Gunnar came in. He had been standing outside the door
of the bower, and heard all the words that had passed. They were
in a great fright when they saw him come in, and then all held
their peace, but before there had been bursts of laughter.</p><br>

<p id="id00785">Gunnar was very wroth, and said to Sigmund, "Thou art a foolish
man, and one that cannot keep to good advice, and thou revilest
Njal's sons, and Njal himself who is most worth of all; and this
thou doest in spite of what thou hast already done. Mind, this
will be thy death. But if any man repeats these words that thou
hast spoken, or these verses that thou hast made, that man shall
be sent away at once, and have my wrath beside."</p><br>

<p id="id00786">But they were all so sore afraid of him, that no one dared to
repeat those words. After that he went away, but the gangrel
women talked among themselves, and said that they would get a
reward from Bergthora if they told her all this.</p><br>

<p id="id00787">They went then away afterwards down thither, and took Bergthora
aside and told her the whole story of their own free will.</p><br>

<p id="id00788">Bergthora spoke and said, when men sate down to the board, "Gifts
have been given to all of you, father and sons, and ye will be no
true men unless ye repay them somehow."</p><br>

<p id="id00789">"What gifts are these?" asks Skarphedinn.</p><br>

<p id="id00790">"You, my sons," says Bergthora, "have got one gift between you
all. Ye are nicknamed `Dungbeardlings,' but my husband `the
Beardless Carle.'"</p><br>

<p id="id00791">"Ours is no woman's nature," says Skarphedinn, "that we should
fly into a rage at every little thing."</p><br>

<p id="id00792">"And yet Gunnar was wroth for your sakes," says she, "and he is
thought to be good-tempered. But if ye do not take vengeance for
this wrong, ye will avenge no shame."</p><br>

<p id="id00793">"The carline, our mother, thinks this fine sport," says
Skarphedinn, and smiled scornfully as he spoke, but still the
sweat burst out upon his brow, and red flecks came over his
checks, but that was not his wont. Grim was silent and bit his
lip. Helgi made no sign, and he said never a word. Hauskuld
went off with Bergthora; she came into the room again, and
fretted and foamed much.</p><br>

<p id="id00794">Njal spoke and said, "`Slow and sure,' says the proverb,
mistress! and so it is with many things, though they try men's
tempers, that there are always two sides to a story, even when
vengeance is taken."</p><br>

<p id="id00795">But at even when Njal was come into his bed, he heard that an axe
came against the panel and rang loudly, but there was another
shut bed, and there the shields were hung up, and he sees that
they are away. He said, "Who have taken down our shields?"</p><br>

<p id="id00796">"Thy sons went out with them," says Bergthora.</p><br>

<p id="id00797">Njal pulled his shoes on his feet, and went out at once, and
round to the other side of the house, and sees that they were
taking their course right up the slope; he said, "Whither away,
Skarphedinn?"</p><br>

<p id="id00798">"To look after thy sheep," he answers.</p><br>

<p id="id00799">"You would not then be armed," said Njal, "if you meant that, and
your errand must be something else."</p><br>

<p id="id00800">Then Skarphedinn sang a song,</p><br>

<p id="id00801">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squanderer of hoarded wealth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some there are that own rich treasure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ore of sea that clasps the earth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet care to count their sheep;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who forge sharp songs of mocking,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death songs, scarcely can possess<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sense of sheep that crop the grass;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as these I seek in fight;"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00802">and said afterwards, "We shall fish for salmon, father."</p><br>

<p id="id00803">"'Twould be well then if it turned out so that the prey does not
get away from you."</p><br>

<p id="id00804">They went their way, but Njal went to his bed, and he said to
Bergthora, "Thy sons were out of doors all of them, with arms,
and now thou must have egged them on to something."</p><br>

<p id="id00805">"I will give them my heartfelt thanks," said Bergthora, "if they
tell me the slaying of Sigmund."</p><br>

<h3 id="id00808" style="margin-top: 3em">45. THE SLAYING OF SIGMUND AND SKIOLLD</h3>

<p id="id00809">Now they, Njal's sons, fare up to Fleetlithe, and were that night
under the Lithe, and when the day began to break, they came near
to Lithend. That same morning both Sigmund and Skiolld rose up
and meant to go to the studhorses; they had bits with them, and
caught the horses that were in the "town" and rode away on them.
They found the stud-horses between two brooks. Skarphedinn
caught sight of them, for Sigmund was in bright clothing.
Skarphedinn said, "See you now the red elf yonder, lads?" They
looked that way, and said they saw him.</p><br>

<p id="id00810">Skarphedinn spoke again: "Thou, Hauskuld, shalt have nothing to
do with it, for thou wilt often be sent about alone without due
heed; but I mean Sigmund for myself; methinks that is like a man;
but Grim and Helgi, they shall try to slay Skiolld."</p><br>

<p id="id00811">Hauskuld sat him down, but they went until they came up to them.
Skarphedinn said to Sigmund, "Take thy weapons and defend
thyself; that is more needful now than to make mocking songs on
me and my brothers."</p><br>

<p id="id00812">Sigmund took up his weapons, but Skarphedinn waited the while.
Skiolld turned against Grim and Helgi, and they fell hotly to
fight. Sigmund had a helm on his head, and a shield at his side,
and was girt with a sword, his spear was in his hand; now he
turns against Skarphedinn, and thrusts at once at him with his
spear, and the thrust came on his shield. Skarphedinn dashes the
spearhaft in two, and lifts up his axe and hews at Sigmund, and
cleaves his shield down to below the handle. Sigmund drew his
sword and cut at Skarphedinn, and the sword cuts into his shield,
so that it stuck fast. Skarphedinn gave the shield such a quick
twist, that Sigmund let go his sword. Then Skarphedinn hews at
Sigmund with his axe; the "Ogress of war." Sigmund had on a
corselet, the axe came on his shoulder. Skarphedinn cleft the
shoulder-blade right through, and at the same time pulled the axe
towards him. Sigmund fell down on both knees, but sprang up
again at once.</p><br>

<p id="id00813">"Thou hast lilted low to me already," says Skarphedinn, "but
still thou shalt fall upon thy mother's bosom ere we two part."</p><br>

<p id="id00814">"Ill is that then," says Sigmund.</p><br>

<p id="id00815">Skarphedinn gave him a blow on his helm, and after that dealt<br>

Sigmund his death-blow.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00816">Grim cut off Skiolld's foot at the ankle-joint, but Helgi thrust
him through with his spear, and he got his death there and then.</p><br>

<p id="id00817">Skarphedinn saw Hallgerda's shepherd, just as he had hewn off
Sigmund's head; he handed the head to the shepherd, and bade him
bear it to Hallgerda, and said she would know whether that head
had made jeering songs about them, and with that he sang a
song ???</p><br>

<p id="id00818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here! this head shalt thou, that heapest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoards from ocean-caverns won, (1)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear to Hallgerd with my greeting,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her that hurries men to fight;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure am I, O firewood splitter!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That yon spendthrift knows it well,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will answer if it ever<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttered mocking songs on us."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00819">The shepherd casts the head down as soon as ever they parted,
for he dared not do so while their eyes were on him. They fared
along till they met some men down by Markfleet, and told them the
tidings. Skarphedinn gave himself out as the slayer of Sigmund
and Grim and Helgi as the slayers of Skiolld; then they fared
home and told Njal the tidings. He answers them, "Good luck to
your hands! Here no self-doom will come to pass as things
stand."</p><br>

<p id="id00820">Now we must take up the story, and say that the shepherd came
home to Lithend. He told Hallgerda the tidings.</p><br>

<p id="id00821">"Skarphedinn put Sigmund's head into my hands," he says, "and
bade me bring it thee; but I dared not do it, for I knew not how
thou wouldst like that."</p><br>

<p id="id00822">"'Twas ill that thou didst not do that," she says; "I would have
brought it to Gunnar, and then he would have avenged his kinsman,
or have to bear every man's blame."</p><br>

<p id="id00823">After that she went to Gunnar and said, "I tell thee of thy
kinsman Sigmund's slaying: Skarphedinn slew him, and wanted them
to bring me the head."</p><br>

<p id="id00824">"Just what might be looked for to befall him," says Gunnar, "for
ill redes bring ill luck, and both you and Skarphedinn have often
done one another spiteful turns."</p><br>

<p id="id00825">Then Gunnar went away; he let no steps be taken towards a suit
for manslaughter, and did nothing about it. Hallgerda often put
him in mind of it, and kept saying that Sigmund had fallen
unatoned. Gunnar gave no heed to that.</p><br>

<p id="id00826">Now three Things passed away, at each of which men thought that
he would follow up the suit; then a knotty point came on Gunnar's
hands, which he knew not how to set about, and then he rode to
find Njal. He gave Gunnar a hearty welcome. Gunnar said to
Njal, "I am come to seek a bit of good counsel at thy hands about
a knotty point."</p><br>

<p id="id00827">"Thou art worthy of it," says Njal, and gave him counsel what to
do. Then Gunnar stood up and thanked him. Njal then spoke, and
said, and took Gunnar by the hand, "Over long hath thy kinsman
Sigmund been unatoned."</p><br>

<p id="id00828">"He has been long ago atoned," says Gunnar, "but still I will not
fling back the honour offered me."</p><br>

<p id="id00829">Gunnar had never spoken an ill word of Njal's sons. Njal would
have nothing else than that Gunnar should make his own award in
the matter. He awarded two hundred in silver, but let Skiolld
fall without a price. They paid down all the money at once.</p><br>

<p id="id00830">Gunnar declared this their atonement at the Thingskala Thing,
when most men were at it, and laid great weight on the way in
which they (Njal and his sons) had behaved; he told too those bad
words which cost Sigmund his life, and no man was to repeat them
or sing the verses, but if any sung them, the man who uttered
them was to fall without atonement.</p><br>

<p id="id00831">Both Gunnar and Njal gave each other their words that no such
matters should ever happen that they would not settle among
themselves; and this pledge was well kept ever after, and they
were always friends.</p><br>

Kettlebjorn the Old's son, of Mossfell. (1) Bishop Isleif was
Gizur's son. Gizur the White kept house at Mossfell, and was a
great chief. That man is also named in this story whose name was
Geir the Priest; his mother was Thorkatla, another daughter of
Kettlebjorn the Old of Mossfell. Geir kept house at Lithe. He
and Gizur backed one another in every matter. At that time Mord
Valgard's son kept house at Hof on the Rangrivervales; he was
crafty and spiteful. Valgard his father was then abroad, but his
mother was dead. He was very envious of Gunnar of Lithend. He
was wealthy, so far as goods went, but had not many friends.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00838" style="margin-top: 3em">47. OF OTKELL IN KIRKBY</h3>

<p id="id00839">There was a man named Otkell; he was the son of Skarf, the son of
Hallkell, who fought with Grim of Grimsness, and felled him on
the holm. (1) This Hallkell and Kettlebjorn the Old were
brothers.</p><br>

<p id="id00840">Otkell kept house at Kirkby; his wife's name was Thorgerda; she
was a daughter of Mar, the son of Runolf, the son of Naddad of
the Faroe Isles. Otkell was wealthy in goods. His son's name
was Thorgeir; he was young in years, and a bold dashing man.</p><br>

<p id="id00841">Skamkell was the name of another man; he kept house at another
farm called Hof (2); he was well off for money, but he was a
spiteful man and a liar; quarrelsome too, and ill to deal with.
He was Otkell's friend. Hallkell was the name of Otkell's
brother; he was a tall strong man, and lived there with Otkell;
their brother's name was Hallbjorn the White; he brought out to
Iceland a thrall, whose name was Malcolm; he was Irish, and had
not many friends.</p><br>

<p id="id00842">Hallbjorn went to stay with Otkell, and so did his thrall
Malcolm. The thrall was always saying that he should think
himself happy if Otkell owned him. Otkell was kind to him, and
gave him a knife and belt, and a full suit of clothes, but the
thrall turned his hand to any work that Otkell wished.</p><br>

<p id="id00843">Otkell wanted to make a bargain with his brother for the thrall;
he said he would give him the thrall, but said, too, that he was
a worse treasure than he thought. But as soon as Otkell owned
the thrall, then he did less and less work. Otkell often said
outright to Hallbjorn, that he thought the thrall did little
work; and he told Otkell that there was worse in him yet to
come.</p><br>

<p id="id00844">At that time came a great scarcity, so that men fell short both
of meat and hay, and that spread over all parts of Iceland.
Gunnar shared his hay and meat with many men; and all got them
who came thither, so long as his stores lasted. At last it came
about that Gunnar himself fell short both of hay and meat. Then
Gunnar called on Kolskegg to go along with him; he called too on
Thrain Sigfus' son, and Lambi Sigurd's son. They fared to
Kirkby, and called Otkell out. He greeted them, and Gunnar said,
"It so happens that I am come to deal with thee for hay and meat,
if there be any left."</p><br>

<p id="id00845">Otkell answers, "There is store of both, but I will sell thee
neither."</p><br>

<p id="id00846">"Wilt thou give me them then," says Gunnar, "and run the risk of
my paying thee back somehow?"</p><br>

<p id="id00847">"I will not do that either," says Otkell.</p><br>

<p id="id00848">Skamkell all the while was giving him bad counsel.</p><br>

<p id="id00849">Then Thrain Sigfus' son, said, "It would serve him right if we
take both hay and meat and lay down the worth of them instead."</p><br>

<p id="id00850">Skamkell answered, "All the men of Mossfell must be dead and gone
then, if ye, sons of Sigfus, are to come and rob them."</p><br>

<p id="id00851">"I will have no hand in any robbery," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00852">"Wilt thou buy a thrall of me?" says Otkell.</p><br>

<p id="id00853">"I'll not spare to do that," says Gunnar. After that Gunnar
bought the thrall, and fared away as things stood.</p><br>

<p id="id00854">Njal hears of this, and said, "Such things are ill done, to
refuse to let Gunnar buy; and it is not a good outlook for others
if such men as he cannot get what they want."</p><br>

<p id="id00855">"What's the good of thy talking so much about such a little
matter," says Bergthora; "far more like a man would it be to let
him have both meat and hay, when thou lackest neither of them."</p><br>

<p id="id00856">"That is clear as day," says Njal, "and I will of a surety supply
his need somewhat."</p><br>

<p id="id00857">Then he fared up to Thorolfsfell, and his sons with him, and they
bound hay on fifteen horses; but on five horses they had meat.
Njal came to Lithend, and called Gunnar out. He greeted them
kindly.</p><br>

<p id="id00858">"Here is hay and meat," said Njal, "which I will give thee; and
my wish is, that thou shouldst never look to any one else than to
me if thou standest in need of anything."</p><br>

<p id="id00859">"Good are thy gifts," says Gunnar, "but methinks thy friendship
is still more worth, and that of thy sons."</p><br>

<p id="id00860">After that Njal fared home, and now the spring passes away.</p><br>

<p id="id00864">Now Gunnar is about to ride to the Thing, but a great crowd of
men from the Side (1) east turned in as guests at his house.</p><br>

<p id="id00865">Gunnar bade them come and be his guests again, as they rode back
from the Thing; and they said they would do so.</p><br>

<p id="id00866">Now they ride to the Thing, and Njal and his sons were there.<br>

That Thing was still and quiet.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00867">Now we must take up the story, and say that Hallgerda comes to
talk with Malcolm the thrall.</p><br>

<p id="id00868">"I have thought of an errand to send thee on," she says; "thou
shalt go to Kirkby."</p><br>

<p id="id00869">"And what shall I do there?" he says.</p><br>

<p id="id00870">"Thou shalt steal from thence food enough to load two horses, and
mind and have butter and cheese; but thou shalt lay fire in the
storehouse, and all will think that it has arisen out of
heedlessness, but no one will think that there has been theft."</p><br>

<p id="id00871">"Bad have I been," said the thrall, "but never have I been a
thief."</p><br>

<p id="id00872">"Hear a wonder!" says Hallgerda, "thou makest thyself good, thou
that hast been both thief and murderer; but thou shalt not dare
to do aught else than go, else will I let thee be slain."</p><br>

<p id="id00873">He thought he knew enough of her to be sure that she would so do
if he went not; so he took at night two horses and laid
packsaddles on them, and went his way to Kirkby. The house-dog
knew him and did not bark at him, and ran and fawned on him.
After that he went to the storehouse and loaded the two horses
with food out of it, but the storehouse he burnt, and the dog he
slew.</p><br>

<p id="id00874">He went up along by Rangriver, and his shoe-thong snapped; so he
takes his knife and makes the shoe right, but he leaves the knife
and belt lying there behind him.</p><br>

<p id="id00875">He fares till he comes to Lithend; then he misses the knife, but
dares not to go back.</p><br>

<p id="id00876">Now he brings Hallgerda the food, and she showed herself well
pleased at it.</p><br>

<p id="id00877">Next morning when men came out of doors at Kirkby there they saw
great scathe. Then a man was sent to the Thing to tell Otkell;
he bore the loss well, and said it must have happened because the
kitchen was next to the storehouse; and all thought that that was
how it happened.</p><br>

<p id="id00878">Now men ride home from the Thing, and many rode to Lithend.<br>

Hallgerda set food on the board, and in came cheese and butter.<br>

Gunnar knew that such food was not to be looked for in his house,<br>

and asked Hallgerda whence it came?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00879">"Thence," she says; "whence thou mightest well eat of it;
besides, it is no man's business to trouble himself with
housekeeping."</p><br>

<p id="id00880">Gunner got wroth and said, "Ill indeed is it if I am a partaker
with thieves;" and with that he gave her a slap on the cheek.</p><br>

<p id="id00881">She said she would bear that slap in mind and repay it if she
could.</p><br>

<p id="id00882">So she went off and he went with her, and then all that was
on the board was cleared away, but flesh-meat was brought in
instead, and all thought that was because the flesh was thought
to have been got in a better way.</p><br>

<p id="id00883">Now the men who had been at the Thing fare away.</p><br>

<h4 id="id00884" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id00885" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">(1) That is, from the sea-side or shore, the long narrow strip

<h3 id="id00886" style="margin-top: 3em">49. OF SKAMKELL'S EVIL COUNSEL</h3>

<p id="id00887">Now we must tell of Skamkell. He rides after some sheep up along
Rangriver, and he sees something shining in the path. He finds a
knife and belt, and thinks he knows both of them. He fares with
them to Kirkby; Otkell was out of doors when Skamkell came. He
spoke to him and said, "Knowest thou aught of these pretty
things?"</p><br>

<p id="id00888">"Of a surety," says Otkell, "I know them."</p><br>

<p id="id00889">"Who owns them?" asks Skamkell.</p><br>

<p id="id00890">"Malcolm the thrall," says Otkell.</p><br>

<p id="id00891">"Then more shall see and know them than we two," says Skamkell,
"for true will I be to thee in counsel."</p><br>

<p id="id00892">They showed them to many men, and all knew them. Then Skamkell
said, "What counsel wilt thou now take?"</p><br>

<p id="id00893">"We shall go and see Mord Valgard's son," answers Otkell, "and
seek counsel of him."</p><br>

<p id="id00894">So they went to Hof, and showed the pretty things to Mord, and
asked him if he knew them?</p><br>

<p id="id00895">He said he knew them well enough, but what was there in that?<br>

"Do you think you have a right to look for anything at Lithend?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00896">"We think it hard for us," says Skamkell, "to know what to do,
when such mighty men have a hand in it."</p><br>

<p id="id00897">"That is so, sure enough," says Mord, "but yet I will get to know
those things, out of Gunnar's household, which none of you will
ever know."</p><br>

<p id="id00898">"We would give thee money," they say, "if thou wouldst search out
this thing."</p><br>

<p id="id00899">"That money I shall buy full dear," answered Mord, "but still,
perhaps, it may be that I will look at the matter."</p><br>

<p id="id00900">They gave him three marks of silver for lending them his help.</p><br>

<p id="id00901">Then he gave them this counsel, that women should go about from
house to house with small ware, and give them to the housewives,
and mark what was given them in return.</p><br>

<p id="id00902">"For," he says, "'tis the turn of mind of all men first to give
away what has been stolen, if they have it in their keeping, and
so it will be here also, if this hath-happened by the hand of
man. Ye shall then come and show me what has been given to each
in each house, and I shall then be free from farther share in
this matter, if the truth comes to light."</p><br>

<p id="id00903">To this they agreed, and went home afterwards.</p><br>

<p id="id00904">Mord sends women about the country, and they were away half a
month. Then they came back, and had big bundles. Mord asked
where they had most given them?</p><br>

<p id="id00905">They said that at Lithend most was given them, and Hallgerda had
been most bountiful to them.</p><br>

<p id="id00906">He asked what was given them there.</p><br>

<p id="id00907">"Cheese," say they.</p><br>

<p id="id00908">He begged to see it, and they showed it to him, and it was in
great slices. These he took and kept.</p><br>

<p id="id00909">A little after, Mord fared to see Otkell, and bade that he would
bring Thorgerda's cheese-mould; and when that was done, he laid
the slices down in it, and lo! they fitted the mould in every
way.</p><br>

<p id="id00910">Then they saw, too, that a whole cheese had been given to them.</p><br>

<p id="id00911">Then Mord said, "Now may ye see that Hallgerda must have stolen
the cheese;" and they all passed the same judgment; and then Mord
said, that now he thought he was free of this matter.</p><br>

<p id="id00912">After that they parted.</p><br>

<p id="id00913">Shortly after Kolskegg fell to talking with Gunnar and said, "Ill
is it to tell, but the story is in every man's mouth, that
Hallgerda must have stolen, and that she was at the bottom of all
that great scathe that befell at Kirkby."</p><br>

<p id="id00914">Gunner said that he too thought that must be so. "But what is to
be done now?"</p><br>

<p id="id00915">Kolskegg answered, "Thou wilt think it thy most bounden duty to
make atonement for thy wife's wrong, and methinks it were best
that thou farest to see Otkell, and makest him a handsome offer."</p><br>

<p id="id00916">"This is well spoken," says Gunnar, "and so it shall be."</p><br>

<p id="id00917">A little after Gunnar sent after Thrain Sigfus' son and Lambi<br>

Sigurd's son, and they came at once.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00918">Gunnar told them whither he meant to go, and they were well
pleased. Gunnar rode with eleven men to Kirkby, and called
Otkell out. Skamkell was there too, and said, "I will go out
with thee, and it will be best now to have the balance of wit on
thy side. And I would wish to stand closest by thee when thou
needest it most, and now this will be put to the proof. Methinks
it were best that thou puttest on an air of great weight."</p><br>

<p id="id00919">Then they, Otkell and Skamkell, and Hallkell, and Hallbjorn, went
out all of them.</p><br>

<p id="id00920">They greeted Gunnar, and he took their greeting well. Otkell
asks whither he meant to go?</p><br>

<p id="id00921">"No farther than here," says Gunnar, "and my errand hither is to
tell thee about that bad mishap, how it arose from the plotting
of my wife and that thrall whom I bought from thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00922">"'Tis only what was to be looked for," says Hallbjorn.</p><br>

<p id="id00923">"Now I will make thee a good offer," says Gunnar, "and the offer
is this, that the best men here in the country round settle the
matter."</p><br>

<p id="id00924">"This is a fair-sounding offer," said Skamkell, "but an unfair
and uneven one. Thou art a man who has many friends among the
householders, but Otkell has not many friends."</p><br>

<p id="id00925">"Well," says Gunnar, "then I will offer thee that I shall make an
award, and utter it here on this spot, and so we will settle the
matter, and my good-will shall follow the settlement. But I will
make thee an atonement by paying twice the worth of what was
lost."</p><br>

<p id="id00926">"This choice shalt thou not take," said Skamkell; "and it is
unworthy to give up to him the right to make his own award, when
thou oughtest to have kept it for thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id00927">So Otkell said, "I will not give up to thee, Gunnar, the right to
make thine own award."</p><br>

<p id="id00928">"I see plainly," said Gunnar, "the help of men who will be paid
off for it one day, I daresay; but come now, utter an award for
thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id00929">Otkell leant toward Skamkell and said, "What shall I answer now?"</p><br>

<p id="id00930">"This thou shalt call a good offer, but still put thy suit into
the hands of Gizur the White, and Geir the Priest, and then many
will say this, that thou behavest like Hallkell, thy grandfather,
who was the greatest of champions."</p><br>

<p id="id00931">"Well offered is this, Gunnar," said Otkell, "but still my will
is thou wouldst give me time to see Gizur the White."</p><br>

<p id="id00932">"Do now whatever thou likest in the matter," said Gunnar; "but
men will say this, that thou couldst not see thine own honour
when thou wouldst have none of the choices I offer thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00933">Then Gunnar rode home, and when he had gone away, Hallbjorn said,
"Here I see how much man differs from man. Gunnar made thee good
offers, but thou wouldst take none of them; or how dost thou
think to strive with Gunnar in a quarrel, when no one is his
match in fight. But now he is still so kind-hearted a man that
it may be he will let these offers stand, though thou art only
ready to take them afterwards. Methinks it were best that thou
farest to see Gizur the White and Geir the Priest now this very
hour."</p><br>

<p id="id00934">Otkell let them catch his horse, and made ready in every way.
Otkell was not sharpsighted, and Skamkell walked on the way along
with him, and said to Otkell, "Methought it strange that thy
brother would not take this toil from thee, and now I will make
thee an offer to fare instead of thee, for I know that the
journey is irksome to thee."</p><br>

<p id="id00935">"I will take that offer," says Otkell, "but mind and be as
truthful as ever thou canst."</p><br>

<p id="id00936">"So it shall be," says Skamkell.</p><br>

<p id="id00937">Then Skamkell took his horse and cloak, but Otkell walks home.</p><br>

<p id="id00938">Hallbjorn was out of doors, and said to Otkell, "Ill is it to
have a thrall for one's bosom friend, and we shall rue this for
ever that thou hast turned back, and it is an unwise step to send
the greatest liar on an errand, of which one may so speak that
men's lives hang on it."</p><br>

<p id="id00939">"Thou wouldst be sore afraid," says Otkell, "if Gunnar had his
bill aloft, when thou art so scared now."</p><br>

<p id="id00940">"No one knows who will be most afraid then," said Hallbjorn; "but
this thou wilt have to own, that Gunnar does not lose much time
in brandishing his bill when he is wroth."</p><br>

<p id="id00941">"Ah!" said Otkell, "ye are all of you for yielding but Skamkell."</p><br>

<p id="id00942">And then they were both wroth.</p><br>

<h3 id="id00943" style="margin-top: 3em">50. OF SKAMKELL'S LYING</h3>

<p id="id00944">Skamkell came to Mossfell, and repeated all the offers to Gizur.</p><br>

<p id="id00945">"It so seems to me," says Gizur, "as though these have been
bravely offered; but why took he not these offers?"</p><br>

<p id="id00946">"The chief cause was," answers Skamkell, "that all wished to show
thee honour, and that was why he waited for thy utterance;
besides, that is best for all."</p><br>

<p id="id00947">So Skamkell stayed there the night over, but Gizur sent a man to
fetch Geir the Priest; and he came there early. Then Gizur told
him the story and said, "What course is to be taken now?"</p><br>

<p id="id00948">"As thou no doubt hast already made up thy mind ??? to make the
best of the business for both sides."</p><br>

<p id="id00949">"Now we will let Skamkell tell his tale a second time, and see
how he repeats it."</p><br>

<p id="id00950">So they did that, and Gizur said, "Thou must have told this story
right; but still I have seen thee to be the wickedest of men, and
there is no faith in faces if thou turnest out well."</p><br>

<p id="id00951">Skamkell fared home, and rides first to Kirkby and calls Otkell
out. He greets Skamkell well, and Skamkell brought him the
greeting of Gizur and Geir.</p><br>

<p id="id00952">"But about this matter of the suit," he says, "there is no need
to speak softly, how that it is the will of both Gizur and Geir
that this suit should not be settled in a friendly way. They
gave that counsel that a summons should be set on foot, and that
Gunnar should be summoned for having partaken of the goods, but
Hallgerda for stealing them."</p><br>

<p id="id00953">"It shall be done," said Otkell, "in everything as they have
given counsel."</p><br>

<p id="id00954">"They thought most of this," says Skamkell, "that thou hadst
behaved so proudly; but as for me, I made as great a man of thee
in everything as I could."</p><br>

<p id="id00955">Now Otkell tells all this to his brothers, and Hallbjorn said,<br>

"This must be the biggest lie."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00956">Now the time goes on until the last of the summoning days before
the Althing came.</p><br>

<p id="id00957">Then Otkell called on his brothers and Skamkell to ride on the
business of the summons to Lithend.</p><br>

<p id="id00958">Hallbjorn said he would go, but said also that they would rue
this summoning as time went on.</p><br>

<p id="id00959">Now they rode twelve of them together to Lithend, but when they
came into the "town," there was Gunnar out of doors, and knew
naught of their coming till they had ridden right up to the
house.</p><br>

<p id="id00960">He did not go in-doors then, and Otkell thundered out the summons
there and then; but when they had made an end of the summoning
Skamkell said, "Is it all right, master?"</p><br>

<p id="id00961">"Ye know that best;" says Gunnar, "but I will put thee in mind of
this journey one of these days, and of thy good help."</p><br>

<p id="id00962">"That will not harm us," says Skamkell, "if thy bill be not
aloft."</p><br>

<p id="id00963">Gunnar was very wroth and went in-doors, and told Kolskegg, and
Kolskegg said, "Ill was it that we were not out of doors; they
should have come here on the most shameful journey, if we had
been by."</p><br>

<p id="id00964">"Everything bides its time," says Gunnar; "but this journey will
not turn out to their honour."</p><br>

<p id="id00965">A little after Gunnar went and told Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00966">"Let it not worry thee a jot," said Njal, "for this will be the
greatest honour to thee, ere this Thing comes to an end. As for
us, we will all back thee with counsel and force."</p><br>

<p id="id00967">Gunnar thanked him and rode home.</p><br>

<p id="id00968">Otkell rides to the Thing, and his brothers with him and<br>

Skamkell.<br>
</p><br>

<h3 id="id00969" style="margin-top: 3em">51. OF GUNNAR</h3>

<p id="id00970">Gunnar rode to the Thing and all the sons of Sigfus; Njal and his
sons too, they all went with Gunnar; and it was said that no band
was so well knit and hardy as theirs.</p><br>

<p id="id00971">Gunnar went one day to the booth of the Dalemen; Hrut was by the
booth and Hauskuld, and they greeted Gunnar well. Now Gunnar
tells them the whole story of the suit up to that time.</p><br>

<p id="id00972">"What counsel gives Njal?" asks Hrut.</p><br>

<p id="id00973">"He bade me seek you brothers," says Gunnar, "and said he was
sure that he and you would look at the matter in the same light."</p><br>

<p id="id00974">"He wishes then," says Hrut, "that I should say what I think
for kinship's sake; and so it shall be. Thou shalt challenge
Gizur the White to combat on the island, if they do not leave the
whole award to thee; but Kolskegg shall challenge Geir the
Priest. As for Otkell and his crew, men must be got ready to
fall on them; and now we have such great strength all of us
together, that thou mayst carry out whatever thou wilt."</p><br>

<p id="id00975">Gunnar went home to his booth and told Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00976">"Just what I looked for," said Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id00977">Wolf Aurpriest got wind of this plan, and told Gizur, and Gizur
said to Otkell, "Who gave thee that counsel that thou shouldst
summon Gunnar?"</p><br>

<p id="id00978">"Skamkell told me that was the counsel of both Geir the Priest
and thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id00979">"But where is that scoundrel?" says Gizur, "who has thus lied."</p><br>

<p id="id00980">"He lies sick up at our booth," says Otkell.</p><br>

<p id="id00981">"May he never rise from his bed," says Gizur. "Now we must all
go to see Gunnar, and offer him the right to make his own award;
but I know not whether he will take that now."</p><br>

<p id="id00982">Many men spoke ill of Skamkell, and he lay sick all through the<br>

Thing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00983">Gizur and his friends went to Gunnar's booth; their coming was
known, and Gunnar was told as he sat in his booth, and then they
all went out and stood in array.</p><br>

<p id="id00984">Gizur the White came first, and after a while he spoke and said,
"This is our offer ??? that thou, Gunnar, makest thine own award
in this suit."</p><br>

<p id="id00985">"Then," says Gunnar, "it was no doubt far from thy counsel that I
was summoned."</p><br>

<p id="id00986">"I gave no such counsel," says Gizur, "neither I nor Geir."</p><br>

<p id="id00987">"Then thou must clear thyself of this charge by fitting proof."</p><br>

<p id="id00988">"What proof dost thou ask?" says Gizur.</p><br>

<p id="id00989">"That thou takest an oath," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id00990">"That I will do," says Gizur, "if thou wilt take the award into
thine own hands."</p><br>

<p id="id00991">"That was the offer I made a while ago," says Gunnar; "but now,
methinks, I have a greater matter to pass judgment on."</p><br>

<p id="id00992">"It will not be right to refuse to make thine own award," said
Njal; "for the greater the matter, the greater the honour in
making it."</p><br>

<p id="id00993">"Well," said Gunnar, "I will do this to please my friends, and
utter my award; but I give Otkell this bit of advice, never to
give me cause for quarrel hereafter."</p><br>

<p id="id00994">Then Hrut and Hauskuld were sent for, and they came thither, and
then Gizur the White and Gier the Priest took their oaths; but
Gunnar made his award, and spoke with no man about it, and
afterwards he uttered it as follows:</p><br>

<p id="id00995">"This is my award," he says; "first, I lay it down that the
storehouse must be paid for, and the food that was therein; but
for the thrall, I will pay thee no fine, for that thou hiddest
his faults; but I award him back to thee; for as the saying is,
`Birds of a feather flock most together.' Then, on the other
hand, I see that thou hast summoned me in scorn and mockery, and
for that I award to myself no less a sum than what the house that
was burnt and the stores in it were worth; but if ye think it
better that we be not set at one again, then I will let you have
your choice of that, but if so I have already made up my mind
what I shall do, and then I will fulfil my purpose."</p><br>

<p id="id00996">"What we ask," said Gizur, "is that thou shouldst not be hard on
Otkell, but we beg this of thee, on the other hand, that thou
wouldst be his friend."</p><br>

<p id="id00997">"That shall never be," said Gunnar, "so long as I live; but he
shall have Skamkell's friendship; on that he has long leant."</p><br>

<p id="id00998">"Well," answers Gizur, "we will close with thee in this matter,
though thou alone layest down the terms."</p><br>

<p id="id00999">Then all this atonement was made and hands were shaken on it, and
Gunnar said to Otkell, "It were wiser to go away to thy kinsfolk;
but if thou wilt be here in this country, mind that thou givest
me no cause of quarrel."</p><br>

<p id="id01000">"That is wholesome counsel," said Gizur; "and so he shall do."</p><br>

<p id="id01001">So Gunnar had the greatest honour from that suit, and afterwards
men rode home from the Thing.</p><br>

<p id="id01002">Now Gunnar sits in his house at home, and so things are quiet for
a while.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01003" style="margin-top: 3em">52. OF RUNOLF, THE SON OF WOLF AURPRIEST</h3>

<p id="id01004">There was a man named Runolf, the son of Wolf Aurpriest, he kept
house at the Dale, east of Markfleet. He was Otkell's guest once
when he rode from the Thing. Otkell gave him an ox, all black,
without a spot of white, nine winters old. Runolf thanked him
for the gift, and bade him come and see him at home whenever he
chose to go; and this bidding stood over for some while, so that
he had not paid the visit. Runolf often sent men to him and put
him in mind that he ought to come; and he always said he would
come, but never went.</p><br>

<p id="id01005">Now Otkell had two horses, dun coloured, with a black stripe down
the back; they were the best steeds to ride in all the country
round, and so fond of each other that whenever one went before
the other ran after him.</p><br>

<p id="id01006">There was an Easterling staying with Otkell, whose name was
Audulf; he had set his heart on Signy, Otkell's daughter. Audulf
was a tall man in growth, and strong.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01007" style="margin-top: 3em">53. HOW OTKELL RODE OVER GUNNAR</h3>

<p id="id01008">It happened next spring that Otkell said that they would ride
east to the Dale, to pay Runolf a visit, and all showed
themselves well pleased at that. Skamkell and his two brothers,
and Audulf and three men more, went along with Otkell. Otkell
rode one of the dun horses, but the other ran loose by his side.
They shaped their course east towards Markfleet; and now Otkell
gallops ahead, and now the horses race against each other, and
they break away from the path up towards the Fleetlithe.</p><br>

<p id="id01009">Now, Otkell goes faster than he wished, and it happened that
Gunnar had gone away from home out of his house all alone; and he
had a corn-sieve in one hand, but in the other a hand-axe. He
goes down to his seed field and sows his corn there, and had laid
his cloak of fine stuff and his axe down by his side, and so he
sows the corn a while.</p><br>

<p id="id01010">Now, it must be told how Otkell rides faster than he would. He
had spurs on his feet, and so he gallops down over the ploughed
field, and neither of them sees the other; and just as Gunnar
stands upright, Otkell rides down upon him and drives one of the
spurs into Gunnar's ear, and gives him a great gash, and it
bleeds at once much.</p><br>

<p id="id01011">Just then Otkell's companions rode up.</p><br>

<p id="id01012">"Ye may see, all of you," says Gunnar, "that thou hast drawn my
blood, and it is unworthy to go on so. First thou hast summoned
me, but now thou treadest me under foot, and ridest over me."</p><br>

<p id="id01013">Skamkell said, "Well it was no worse, master, but thou wast not
one whit less wroth at the Thing, when thou tookest the selfdoom
and clutchedst thy bill."</p><br>

<p id="id01014">Gunnar said, "When we two next meet thou shalt see the bill."
After that they part thus, and Skamkell shouted out and said, "Ye
ride hard, lads!"</p><br>

<p id="id01015">Gunnar went home, and said never a word to any one about what had
happened, and no one thought that this wound could have come by
man's doing.</p><br>

<p id="id01016">It happened, though, one day, that he told it to his brother
Kolskegg, and Kolskegg said, "This thou shalt tell to more men,
so that it may not be said that thou layest blame on dead men;
for it will be gainsaid if witnesses do not know beforehand what
has passed between you."</p><br>

<p id="id01017">Then Gunnar told it to his neighbours, and there was little talk
about it at first.</p><br>

<p id="id01018">Otkell comes east to the Dale, and they get a hearty welcome
there, and sit there a week.</p><br>

<p id="id01019">Skamkell told Runolf all about their meeting with Gunnar, and how
it had gone off; and one man happened to ask how Gunnar behaved.</p><br>

<p id="id01020">"Why," said Skamkell, "if it were a low-born man it would have
been said that he had wept."</p><br>

<p id="id01021">"Such things are ill spoken," says Runolf, "and when ye two next
meet, thou wilt have to own that there is no voice of weeping in
his frame of mind; and it will be well if better men have not to
pay for thy spite. Now it seems to me best when ye wish to go
home that I should go with you, for Gunnar will do me no harm."</p><br>

<p id="id01022">"I will not have that," says Otkell; "but I will ride across the<br>

Fleet lower down."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01023">Runolf gave Otkell good gifts, and said they should not see one
another again.</p><br>

<p id="id01024">Otkell bade him then to bear his sons in mind if things turned
out so.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01025" style="margin-top: 3em">54. THE FIGHT AT RANGRIVER</h3>

<p id="id01026">Now we must take up the story, and say that Gunnar was out of
doors at Lithend, and sees his shepherd galloping up to the yard.
The shepherd rode straight into the "town"; and Gunnar said, "Why
ridest thou so hard?"</p><br>

<p id="id01027">"I would be faithful to thee," said the man; "I saw men riding
down along Markfleet, eight of them together, and four of them
were in coloured clothes."</p><br>

<p id="id01028">Gunnar said, "That must be Otkell."</p><br>

<p id="id01029">The lad said, "I have often heard many temper-trying words of
Skamkell's; for Skamkell spoke away there east at Dale, and said
that thou sheddest tears when they rode over thee; but I tell it
thee because I cannot bear to listen to such speeches of
worthless men."</p><br>

<p id="id01030">"We must not be word-sick," says Gunnar, "but from this day forth
thou shall do no other work than what thou choosest for thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id01031">"Shall I say aught of this to Kolskegg thy brother?" asked the
shepherd.</p><br>

<p id="id01032">"Go thou and sleep," says Gunnar; "I will tell Kolskegg."</p><br>

<p id="id01033">The lad laid him down and fell asleep at once, but Gunnar took
the shepherd's horse and laid his saddle on him; he took his
shield, and girded him with his sword, Oliver's gift; he sets his
helm on his head; takes his bill, and something sung loud in it,
and his mother, Rannveig, heard it. She went up to him and said
"Wrathful art thou now, my son, and never saw I thee thus
before."</p><br>

<p id="id01034">Gunnar goes out, and drives the butt of his spear into the earth,
and throws himself into the saddle, and rides away,</p><br>

<p id="id01035">His mother, Rannveig, went into the sitting-room, where there was
a great noise of talking.</p><br>

<p id="id01036">"Ye speak loud," she says, "but yet the bill gave a louder sound
when Gunnar went out."</p><br>

<p id="id01037">Kolskegg heard what she said, and spoke, "This betokens no small
tidings.</p><br>

<p id="id01038">"That is well," says Hallgerda, "now they will soon prove whether
he goes away from them weeping."</p><br>

<p id="id01039">Kolskegg takes his weapons and seeks him a horse, and rides after<br>

Gunnar as fast as he could.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01040">Gunnar rides across Acretongue, and so to Geilastofna and thence
to Rangriver, and down the stream to the ford at Hof. There were
some women at the milking-post there. Gunnar jumped off his
horse and tied him up. By this time the others were riding up
towards him; there were flat stones covered with mud in the path
that led down to the ford.</p><br>

<p id="id01041">Gunnar called out to them and said, "Now is the time to guard
yourselves; here now is the bill, and here now ye will put it to
the proof whether I shed one tear for all of you."</p><br>

<p id="id01042">Then they all of them sprang off their horses' backs and made
towards Gunnar. Hallbjorn was the foremost.</p><br>

<p id="id01043">"Do not thou come on," says Gunnar; "thee last of all would I
harm; but I will spare no one if I have to fight for my life."</p><br>

<p id="id01044">"That I cannot do," says Hallbjorn; "thou wilt strive to kill my
brother for all that, and it is a shame if I sit idly by." And
as he said this he thrust at Gunnar with a great spear which he
held in both hands.</p><br>

<p id="id01045">Gunnar threw his shield before the blow, but Hallbjorn pierced
the shield through. Gunnar thrust the shield down so hard that
it stood fast in the earth (1), but he brandished his sword so
quickly that no eye could follow it, and he made a blow with the
sword, and it fell on Hallbjorn's arm above the wrist, so that it
cut it off.</p><br>

<p id="id01046">Skamkell ran behind Gunnar's back and makes a blow at him with a
great axe. Gunnar turned short round upon him and parries the
blow with the bill, and caught the axe under one of its horns
with such a wrench that it flew out of Skamkell's hand away into
the river.</p><br>

<p id="id01047">Then Gunnar sang a song:</p><br>

<p id="id01048">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once thou askedst, foolish fellow,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this man, this seahorse racer,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When as fast as feet could foot it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth ye fled from farm of mine,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether that were rightly summoned?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with gore the spear we redden,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battle-eager, and avenge us<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus on thee, vile source of strife."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01049">Gunnar gives another thrust with his bill, and through Skamkell,
and lifts him up and casts him down in the muddy path on his
head.</p><br>

<p id="id01050">Audulf the Easterling snatches up a spear and launches it at<br>

Gunnar. Gunnar caught the spear with his hand in the air, and<br>

hurled it back at once, and it flew through the shield and the<br>

Easterling too, and so down into the earth.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01051">Otkell smites at Gunnar with his sword, and aims at his leg just
below the knee, but Gunnar leapt up into the air and he misses
him. Then Gunnar thrusts at him the bill and the blow goes
through him.</p><br>

<p id="id01052">Then Kolskegg comes up, and rushes at once at Hallkell and dealt
him his death-blow with his short sword. There and then they
slay eight men.</p><br>

<p id="id01053">A woman who saw all this, ran home and told Mord, and besought
him to part them.</p><br>

<p id="id01054">"They alone will be there," he says, "of whom I care not though
they slay one another."</p><br>

<p id="id01055">"Thou canst not mean to say that," she says, "for thy kinsman<br>

Gunnar, and thy friend Otkell will be there."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01056">"Baggage, that thou art," he says, "thou art always chattering,"
and so he lay still in-doors while they fought.</p><br>

<p id="id01057">Gunnar and Kolskegg rode home after this work, and they rode hard
up along the river bank, and Gunnar leapt off his horse and came
down on his feet.</p><br>

<p id="id01058">Then Kolskegg said, "Hard now thou ridest, brother!"</p><br>

<p id="id01059">"Ay," said Gunnar, "that was what Skamkell said when he uttered
those very words when they rode over me."</p><br>

<p id="id01060">"Well, thou hast avenged that now," says Kolskegg.</p><br>

<p id="id01061">"I would like to know," says Gunnar, "whether I am by so much the
less brisk and bold than other men, because I think more of
killing men than they?"</p><br>

<h3 id="id01064" style="margin-top: 3em">55. NJAL'S ADVICE TO GUNNAR</h3>

<p id="id01065">Now those tidings are heard far and wide, and many said that they
thought they had not happened before it was likely. Gunnar rode
to Bergthorsknoll and told Njal of these deeds.</p><br>

<p id="id01066">Njal said, "Thou hast done great things, but thou hast been
sorely tried."</p><br>

<p id="id01067">"How will it now go henceforth?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01068">"Wilt thou that I tell thee what hath not yet come to pass?" asks
Njal. "Thou wilt ride to the Thing, and thou wilt abide by my
counsel and get the greatest honour from this matter. This will
be the beginning of thy manslayings."</p><br>

<p id="id01069">"But give me some cunning counsel," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01070">"I will do that," says Njal, "never slay more than one man in the
same stock, and never break the peace which good men and true
make between thee and others, and least of all in such a matter
as this."</p><br>

<p id="id01071">Gunnar said, "I should have thought there was more risk of that
with others than with me."</p><br>

<p id="id01072">"Like enough," says Njal, "but still thou shalt so think of thy
quarrels, that if that should come to pass of which I have warned
thee, then thou wilt have but a little while to live; but
otherwise, thou wilt come to be an old man."</p><br>

<p id="id01073">Gunnar said, "Dost thou know what will be thine own death?"</p><br>

<p id="id01074">"I know it," says Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01075">"What?" asks Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01076">"That," says Njal, "which all would be the last to think."</p><br>

<p id="id01077">After that Gunnar rode home.</p><br>

<p id="id01078">A man was sent to Gizur the White and Geir the Priest, for they
had the blood-feud after Otkell. Then they had a meeting, and
had a talk about what was to be done; and they were of one mind
that the quarrel should be followed up at law. Then some one was
sought who would take the suit up, but no one was ready to do
that.</p><br>

<p id="id01079">"It seems to me," says Gizur, "that now there are only two
courses, that one of us two undertakes the suit, and then we
shall have to draw lots who it shall be, or else the man will be
unatoned. We may make up our minds, too, that this will be a
heavy suit to touch; Gunnar has many kinsmen and is much beloved;
but that one of us who does not draw the lot, shall ride to the
Thing and never leave it until the suit comes to an end."</p><br>

<p id="id01080">After that they drew lots, and Geir the Priest drew the lot to
take up the suit.</p><br>

<p id="id01081">A little after, they rode from the west over the river, and came
to the spot where the meeting had been by Rangriver, and dug up
the bodies, and took witness to the wounds. After that they gave
lawful notice and summoned nine neighbours to bear witness in the
suit.</p><br>

<p id="id01082">They were told that Gunnar was at home with about thirty men;
then Geir the Priest asked whether Gizur would ride against him
with one hundred men.</p><br>

<p id="id01083">"I will not do that," says he, "though the balance of force is
great on our side."</p><br>

<p id="id01084">After that they rode back home. The news that the suit was set
on foot was spread all over the country, and the saying ran that
the Thing would be very noisy and stormy.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01085" style="margin-top: 3em">56. GUNNAR AND GEIR THE PRIEST STRIVE AT THE THING</h3>

<p id="id01086">There was a man named Skapti. He was the son of Thorod (1).
That father and son were great chiefs, and very well skilled in
law. Thorod was thought to be rather crafty and guileful. They
stood by Gizur the White in every quarrel.</p><br>

<p id="id01087">As for the Lithemen and the dwellers by Rangriver, they came in a
great body to the Thing. Gunnar was so beloved that all said
with one voice that they would back him.</p><br>

<p id="id01088">Now they all come to the Thing and fit up their booths. In
company with Gizur the White were these chiefs: Skapti Thorod's
son, Asgrim Ellidagrim's son, Oddi of Kidberg, and Halldor
Ornolf's son.</p><br>

<p id="id01089">Now one day men went to the Hill of Laws, and then Geir the
Priest stood up and gave notice that he had a suit of
manslaughter against Gunnar for the slaying of Otkell. Another
suit of manslaughter he brought against Gunnar for the slaying of
Halljborn the White; then, too, he went on in the same way as to
the slaying of Audulf, and so, too, as to the slaying of
Skamkell. Then, too, he laid a suit of manslaughter against
Kolskegg for the slaying of Hallkell.</p><br>

<p id="id01090">And when he had given due notice of all his suits of manslaughter
it was said that he spoke well. He asked, too, in what Quarter
court the suits lay, and in what house in the district the
defendants dwelt. After that men went away from the Hill of
Laws, and so the Thing goes on till the day when the courts were
to be set to try suits. Then either side gathered their men
together in great strength.</p><br>

<p id="id01091">Geir the Priest and Gizur the White stood at the court of the men
of Rangriver looking north, and Gunnar and Njal stood looking
south towards the court.</p><br>

<p id="id01092">Geir the Priest bade Gunnar to listen to his oath, and then he
took the oath, and afterwards declared his suit.</p><br>

<p id="id01093">Then he let men bear witness of the notice given by the suit;
then he called upon the neighbours who were to form the inquest
to take their seats; then he called on Gunnar to challenge the
inquest; and then he called on the inquest to utter their
finding. Then the neighbours who were summoned on the inquest
went to the court and took witness, and said that there was a bar
to their finding in the suit as to Audulf's slaying, because the
next of kin who ought to follow it up was in Norway, and so they
had nothing to do with that suit.</p><br>

<p id="id01094">After that they uttered their finding in the suit as to Otkell,
and brought in Gunnar as truly guilty of killing him.</p><br>

<p id="id01095">Then Geir the Priest called on Gunnar for his defence, and took
witness of all the steps in the suit which had been proved.</p><br>

<p id="id01096">Then Gunnar, in his turn, called on Geir the Priest to listen to
his oath, and to the defence which he was about to bring forward
in the suit. Then he took the oath and said, "This defence I
make to this suit, that I took witness and outlawed Otkell before
my neighbours for that bloody wound which I got when Otkell gave
me a hurt with his spur; but thee, Geir the Priest, I forbid by a
lawful protest made before a priest, to pursue this suit, and so,
too, I forbid the judges to hear it; and with this I make all the
steps hitherto taken in this suit void and of none-effect. I
forbid thee by a lawful protest, a full, fair, and binding
protest, as I have a right to forbid thee by the common custom of
the Thing and by the law of the land.</p><br>

<p id="id01097">"Besides, I will tell thee something else which I mean to do,"
says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01098">"What!" says Geir, "wilt thou challenge me to the island as thou
art wont, and not bear the law?"</p><br>

<p id="id01099">"Not that," says Gunnar; "I shall summon thee at the Hill of Laws
for that thou calledst those men on the inquest who had no right
to deal with Audulf's slaying, and I will declare thee for that
guilty of outlawry."</p><br>

<p id="id01100">Then Njal said, "Things must not take this turn, for the only end
of it will be that this strife will be carried to the uttermost.
Each of you, as it seems to me, has much on his side. There are
some of these manslaughters, Gunnar, about which thou canst say
nothing to hinder the court from finding thee guilty; but thou
hast set on foot a suit against Geir, in which he, too, must be
found guilty. Thou too, Geir the Priest, shalt know that this
suit of outlawry which hangs over thee shall not fall to the
ground if thou wilt not listen to my words."</p><br>

<p id="id01101">Thorod the Priest said, "It seems to us as though the most
peaceful way would be that a settlement and atonement were come
to in the suit. But why sayest thou so little, Gizur the White?"</p><br>

<p id="id01102">"It seems to me," says Gizur, "as though we shall need to have
strong props for our suit; we may see, too, that Gunnar's friends
stand near him, and so the best turn for us that things can take
will be that good men and true should utter an award on the suit,
if Gunnar so wills it."</p><br>

<p id="id01103">"I have ever been willing to make matters up," says Gunnar; "and
besides, ye have much wrong to follow up, but still I think I was
hard driven to do as I did."</p><br>

<p id="id01104">And now the end of those suits was, by the counsel of the wisest
men, that all the suits were put to arbitration; six men were to
make this award, and it was uttered there and then at the Thing.</p><br>

<p id="id01105">The award was that Skamkell should be unatoned. The blood money
for Otkell's death was to be set off against the hurt Gunnar got
from the spur; and as for the rest of the manslaughters, they
were paid for after the worth of the men, and Gunnar's kinsmen
gave money so that all the fines might be paid up at the Thing.</p><br>

<p id="id01106">Then Geir the Priest and Gizur the White went up and gave Gunnar
pledges that they would keep the peace in good faith.</p><br>

<p id="id01107">Gunnar rode home from the Thing, and thanked men for their help,
and gave gifts to many, and got the greatest honour from the
suit.</p><br>

<p id="id01108">Now Gunnar sits at home in his honour.</p><br>

<p id="id01112">There was a man named Starkad; he was a son of Bork the Waxy-
toothed-blade, the son of Thorkell Clubfoot, who took the land
round about Threecorner as the first settler. His wife's name
was Hallbera (1). The sons of Starkad and Hallbera were these:
Thorgeir and Bork and Thorkell. Hildigunna the Leech was their
sister.</p><br>

<p id="id01113">They were very proud men in temper, hard-hearted and unkind.<br>

They treated men wrongfully.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01114">There was a man named Egil; he was a son of Kol, who took land as
a settler between Storlek and Reydwater. The brother of Egil was
Aunund of Witchwood, father of Hall the Strong, who was at the
slaying of Holt-Thorir with the sons of Kettle the Smooth-
tongued.</p><br>

<p id="id01115">Egil kept house at Sandgil; his sons were these: Kol, and Ottar,
and Hauk. Their mother's name was Steinvor; she was Starkad's
sister.</p><br>

<p id="id01116">Egil's sons were tall and strifeful; they were most unfair men.
They were always on one side with Starkad's sons. Their sister
was Gudruna Nightsun, and she was the bestbred of women.</p><br>

<p id="id01117">Egil had taken into his house two Easterlings; the one's name was
Thorir and the other's Thorgrim. They were not long come out
hither for the first time, and were wealthy and beloved by their
friends; they were well skilled in arms, too, and dauntless in
everything.</p><br>

<p id="id01118">Starkad had a good horse of chesnut hue, and it was thought that
no horse was his match in fight. Once it happened that these
brothers from Sandgil were away under the Threecorner. They had
much gossip about all the householders in the Fleetlithe, and
they fell at last to asking whether there was any one that would
fight a horse against them.</p><br>

<p id="id01119">But there were some men there who spoke so as to flatter and
honour them, that not only was there no one who would dare do
that, but that there was no one that had such a horse.</p><br>

<p id="id01120">Then Hildigunna answered, "I know that man who will dare to fight
horses with you."</p><br>

<p id="id01121">"Name him," they say.</p><br>

<p id="id01122">"Gunnar has a brown horse," she says, "and he will dare to fight
his horse against you, and against any one else."</p><br>

<p id="id01123">"As for you women," they say, "you think no one can be Gunnar's
match; but though Geir the Priest or Gizur the White have come
off with shame from before him, still it is not settled that we
shall fare in the same way."</p><br>

<p id="id01124">"Ye will fare much worse," she says: and so there arose out of
this the greatest strife between them. Then Starkad said, "My
will is that ye try your hands on Gunnar last of all; for ye will
find it hard work to go against his good luck."</p><br>

<p id="id01125">"Thou wilt give us leave, though, to offer him a horsefight?"</p><br>

<p id="id01126">"I will give you leave, if ye play him no trick."</p><br>

<p id="id01127">They said they would be sure to do what their father said.</p><br>

<p id="id01128">Now they rode to Lithend; Gunnar was at home, and went out, and
Kolskegg and Hjort went with him, and they gave them a hearty
welcome, and asked whither they meant to go?</p><br>

<p id="id01129">"No farther than hither," they say. "We are told that thou hast a
good horse, and we wish to challenge thee to a horse-fight."</p><br>

<p id="id01130">"Small stories can go about my horse," says Gunnar; "he is young
and untried in every way."</p><br>

<p id="id01131">"But still thou wilt be good enough to have the fight, for
Hildigunna guessed that thou wouldest be easy in matching thy
horse."</p><br>

<p id="id01132">"How came ye to talk about that?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01133">"There were some men," say they, "who were sure that no one would
dare to fight his horse with ours."</p><br>

<p id="id01134">"I would dare to fight him," says Gunnar; "but I think that was
spitefully said."</p><br>

<p id="id01135">"Shall we look upon the match as made, then?" they asked.</p><br>

<p id="id01136">"Well, your journey will seem to you better if ye have your way
in this; but still I will beg this of you, that we so fight our
horses that we make sport for each other, but that no quarrel may
arise from it, and that ye put no shame upon me; but if ye do to
me as ye do to others, then there will be no help for it but that
I shall give you such a buffet as it will seem hard to you to put
up with. In a word, I shall do then just as ye do first."</p><br>

<p id="id01137">Then they ride home. Starkad asked how their journey had gone
off; they said that Gunnar had made their going good.</p><br>

<p id="id01138">"He gave his word to fight his horse, and we settled when and
where the horse-fight should be; but it was plain in everything
that he thought he fell short of us, and he begged and prayed to
get off."</p><br>

<p id="id01139">"It will often be found," says Hildigunna, "that Gunnar is slow
to be drawn into quarrels, but a hard hitter if he cannot avoid
them."</p><br>

<p id="id01140">Gunnar rode to see Njal, and told him of the horse-fight, and
what words had passed between them, "But how dost thou think the
horse-fight will turn out?"</p><br>

<p id="id01141">"Thou wilt be uppermost," says Njal, "but yet many a man's bane
will arise out of this fight."</p><br>

<p id="id01142">"Will my bane perhaps come out of it?" asks Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01143">"Not out of this," says Njal; "but still they will bear in mind
both the old and the new feud who fare against thee, and thou
wilt have naught left for it but to yield."</p><br>

<p id="id01144">Then Gunnar rode home.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01147" style="margin-top: 3em">58. HOW GUNNAR'S HORSE FOUGHT</h3>

<p id="id01148">Just then Gunnar heard of the death of his father-in-law
Hauskuld; a few nights after, Thorgerda, Thrain's wife, was
delivered at Gritwater, and gave birth to a boy child. Then she
sent a man to her mother, and bade her choose whether it should
be called Glum or Hauskuld. She bade call it Hauskuld. So that
name was given to the boy.</p><br>

<p id="id01149">Gunnar and Hallgerda had two sons, the one's name was Hogni and
the other's Grani. Hogni was a brave man of few words,
distrustful and slow to believe, but truthful.</p><br>

<p id="id01150">Now men ride to the horse-fight, and a very great crowd is
gathered together there. Gunnar was there and his brothers, and
the sons of Sigfus. Njal and all his sons. There too was come
Starkad and his sons, and Egil and his sons, and they said to
Gunnar that now they would lead the horses together.</p><br>

<p id="id01151">Gunnar said, "That was well."</p><br>

<p id="id01152">Skarphedinn said, "Wilt thou that I drive thy horse, kinsman<br>

Gunnar?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01153">"I will not have that," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01154">"It wouldn't be amiss though," says Skarphedinn; "we are hot-
headed on both sides."</p><br>

<p id="id01155">"Ye would say or do little," says Gunnar, "before a quarrel would
spring up; but with me it will take longer, though it will be all
the same in the end."</p><br>

<p id="id01156">After that the horses were led together; Gunnar busked him to
drive his horse, but Skarphedinn led him out. Gunnar was in a
red kirtle, and had about his loins a broad belt, and a great
riding-rod in his hand.</p><br>

<p id="id01157">Then the horses ran at one another, and bit each other long, so
that there was no need for any one to touch them, and that was
the greatest sport.</p><br>

<p id="id01158">Then Thorgeir and Kol made up their minds that they would push
their horse forward just as the horses rushed together, and see
if Gunnar would fall before him.</p><br>

<p id="id01159">Now the horses ran at one another again, and both Thorgeir and<br>

Kol ran alongside their horses' flank.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01160">Gunnar pushes his horse against them, and what happened in a
trice was this, that Thorgeir and his brother fall down flat on
their backs, and their horse a-top of them.</p><br>

<p id="id01161">Then they spring up and rush at Gunnar. Gunnar swings himself
free and seizes Kol, casts him down on the field, so that he lies
senseless. Thorgeir Starkad's son smote Gunnar's horse such a
blow that one of his eyes started out. Gunnar smote Thorgeir
with his riding-rod, and down falls Thorgeir senseless; but
Gunnar goes to his horse, and said to Kolskegg, "Cut off the
horse's head; he shall not live a maimed and blemished beast."</p><br>

<p id="id01162">So Kolskegg cut the head off the horse.</p><br>

<p id="id01163">Then Thorgeir got on his feet and took his weapons, and wanted to
fly at Gunnar, but that was stopped, and there was a great throng
and crush.</p><br>

<p id="id01164">Skarphedinn said, "This crowd wearies me, and it is far more
manly that men should fight it out with weapons; and so he sang a
song:</p><br>

<p id="id01165">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the Thing there is a throng;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past all bounds the crowding comes;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard 'twill be to patch up peace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt the men. This wearies me;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worthier is it far for men<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons red with gore to stain;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one would sooner tame<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunger huge of cub of wolf."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01166">Gunnar was still, so that one man held him, and spoke no ill
words.</p><br>

<p id="id01167">Njal tried to bring about a settlement, or to get pledges of
peace; but Thorgeir said he would neither give nor take peace;
far rather, he said, would he see Gunnar dead for the blow.</p><br>

<p id="id01168">Kolskegg said, "Gunnar has before now stood too fast, than that
he should have fallen for words alone, and so it will be again."</p><br>

<p id="id01169">Now men ride away from the horse-field, every one to his home.
They make no attack on Gunnar, and so that halfyear passed away.
At the Thing, the summer after, Gunnar met Olaf the peacock, his
cousin, and he asked him to come and see him, but yet bade him be
ware of himself; "For," says he, "they will do us all the harm
they can, and mind and fare always with many men at thy back."</p><br>

<p id="id01170">He gave him much good counsel beside, and they agreed that there
should be the greatest friendship between them.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01171" style="margin-top: 3em">59. OF ASGRIM AND WOLF UGGIS' SON</h3>

<p id="id01172">Asgrim Ellidagrim's son had a suit to follow up at the Thing
against Wolf Uggis' son. It was a matter of inheritance. Asgrim
took it up in such a way as was seldom his wont; for there was a
bar to his suit, and the bar was this, that he had summoned five
neighbours to bear witness, when he ought to have summoned nine.
And now they have this as their bar.</p><br>

<p id="id01173">Then Gunnar spoke and said, "I will challenge thee to single
combat on the island, Wolf Uggis' son, if men are not to get
their rights by law; and Njal and my friend Helgi would like that
I should take some share in defending thy cause, Asgrim, if they
were not here themselves."</p><br>

<p id="id01174">"But," says Wolf, "this quarrel is not one between thee and me."</p><br>

<p id="id01175">"Still it shall be as good as though it were," says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01176">And the end of the suit was, that Wolf had to pay down all the
money.</p><br>

<p id="id01177">Then Asgrim said to Gunnar, "I will ask thee to come and see me
this summer, and I will ever be with thee in lawsuits, and never
against thee."</p><br>

<p id="id01178">Gunnar rides home from the Thing, and a little while after he and
Njal met. Njal besought Gunnar to be ware of himself, and said
he had been told that those away under the Threecorner meant to
fall on him, and bade him never go about with a small company,
and always to have his weapons with him. Gunnar said so it
should be, and told him that Asgrim had asked him to pay him a
visit, "and I mean to go now this harvest."</p><br>

<p id="id01179">"Let no men know before thou farest how long thou wilt be away,"
said Njal; "but, besides, I beg thee to let my sons ride with
thee, and then no attack will be made on thee."</p><br>

<p id="id01180">So they settled that among themselves.</p><br>

<p id="id01181">Now the summer wears away till it was eight weeks to winter, and
then Gunnar says to Kolskegg, "Make thee ready to ride, for we
shall ride to a feast at Tongue."</p><br>

<p id="id01182">"Shall we say anything about it to Njal's sons?" said Kolskegg.</p><br>

<p id="id01183">"No," says Gunnar; "they shall fall into no quarrels for me."</p><br>

<h3 id="id01184" style="margin-top: 3em">60. AN ATTACK AGAINST GUNNAR AGREED ON</h3>

<p id="id01185">They rode three together, Gunnar and his brothers. Gunnar had
the bill and his sword, Oliver's gift; but Kolskegg had his short
sword; Hjort, too, had proper weapons.</p><br>

<p id="id01186">Now they rode to Tongue, and Asgrim gave them a hearty welcome,
and they were there some while. At last they gave it out that
they meant to go home there and then. Asgrim gave them good
gifts, and offered to ride east with them, but Gunnar said there
was no need of any such thing; and so he did not go.</p><br>

<p id="id01187">Sigurd Swinehead was the name of a man who dwelt by Thurso water.
He came to the farm under the Threecorner, for he had given his
word to keep watch on Gunnar's doings, and so he went and told
them of his journey home; "and," quoth he, "there could never be
a finer chance than just now, when he has only two men with him."</p><br>

<p id="id01188">"How many men shall we need to have to lie in wait for him?" says<br>

Starkad.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01189">"Weak men shall be as nothing before him," he says; "and it is
not safe to have fewer than thirty men."</p><br>

<p id="id01190">"Where shall we lie in wait?"</p><br>

<p id="id01191">"By Knafaholes," he says; "there he will not see us before he
comes on us."</p><br>

<p id="id01192">"Go thou to Sandgil and tell Egil that fifteen of them must busk
themselves thence, and now other fifteen will go hence to
Knafaholes."</p><br>

<p id="id01193">Thorgeir said to Hildigunna, "This hand shall show thee Gunnar
dead this very night."</p><br>

<p id="id01194">"Nay, but I guess," says she, "that thou wilt hang thy head after
ye two meet."</p><br>

<p id="id01195">So those four, father and sons, fare away from the Threecorner,
and eleven men besides, and they fared to Knafaholes, and lay in
wait there.</p><br>

<p id="id01196">Sigurd Swinehead came to Sandgil and said, "Hither am I sent by
Starkad and his sons to tell thee, Egil, that ye, father and
sons, must fare to Knafaholes to lie in wait for Gunnar."</p><br>

<p id="id01197">"How many shall we fare in all?" says Egil.</p><br>

<p id="id01198">"Fifteen, reckoning me," he says.</p><br>

<p id="id01199">Kol said, "Now I mean to try my hand on Kolskegg."</p><br>

<p id="id01200">"Then I think thou meanest to have a good deal on thy hands,"
says Sigurd.</p><br>

<p id="id01201">Egil begged his Easterlings to fare with him. They said they had
no quarrel with Gunnar; "and besides," says Thorir, "ye seem to
need much help here, when a crowd of men shall go against three
men."</p><br>

<p id="id01202">Then Egil went away and was wroth.</p><br>

<p id="id01203">Then the mistress of the house said to the Easterling, "In an
evil hour hath my daughter Gudruna humbled herself, and broken
the point of her maidenly pride, and lain by thy side as thy
wife, when thou wilt not dare to follow thy father-in-law, and
thou must be a coward," she says.</p><br>

<p id="id01204">"I will go," he says, "with thy husband, and neither of us two
shall come back."</p><br>

<p id="id01205">After that he went to Thorgrim his messmate, and said, "Take thou
now the keys of my chests; for I shall never unlock them again.
I bid thee take for thine own whatever of our goods thou wilt;
but sail away from Iceland, and do not think of revenge for me.
But if thou dost not leave the land, it will be thy death."</p><br>

<p id="id01206">So the Easterling joined himself to their band.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01207" style="margin-top: 3em">61. GUNNAR'S DREAM</h3>

<p id="id01208">Now we must go back and say that Gunnar rides east over Thurso
water, but when he had gone a little way from the river, he grew
very drowsy, and bade them lie down and rest there.</p><br>

<p id="id01209">They did so. He fell fast asleep, and struggled much as he
slumbered.</p><br>

<p id="id01210">Then Kolskegg said, "Gunnar dreams now." But Hjort said, "I
would like to wake him."</p><br>

<p id="id01211">"That shall not be," said Kolskegg, "but he shall dream his
dream out."</p><br>

<p id="id01212">Gunnar lay, a very long while, and threw off his shield from him,
and he grew very warm. Kolskegg said, "What hast thou dreamt,
kinsman?"</p><br>

<p id="id01213">"That have I dreamt," says Gunnar, "which if I had dreamt it
there, I would never have ridden with so few men from Tongue."</p><br>

<p id="id01214">"Tell us thy dream," says Kolskegg.</p><br>

<p id="id01215">Then Gunnar sang a song:</p><br>

<p id="id01216">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief, that chargest foes in fight!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I fear that I have ridden<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short of men from Tongue, this harvest;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven's fast I sure shall break.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, that scatters Ocean's fire! (1)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, at least, I long to say,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kite with wolf shall fight for marrow<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill I dreamt with wandering thought."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01217">"I dreamt, methought, that I was riding on by Knafaholes, and
there I thought I saw many wolves, and they all made at me; but I
turned away from them straight towards Rangriver, and then
methought they pressed hard on me on all sides, but I kept them
at bay, and shot all those that were foremost, till they came so
close to me that I could not use my bow against them. Then I
took my sword, and I smote with it with one hand, but thrust at
them with my bill with the other. Shield myself then I did not,
and methought then I knew not what shielded me. Then I slew many
wolves, and thou, too, Kolskegg; but Hjort methought they pulled
down, and tore open his breast, and one methought had his heart
in his maw; but I grew so wroth that I hewed that wolf asunder
just below the brisket, and after that methought the wolves
turned and fled. Now my counsel is, brother Hjort, that thou
ridest back west to Tongue."</p><br>

<p id="id01218">"I will not do that," says Hjort; "though I know my death is
sure, I will stand by thee still."</p><br>

<p id="id01219">Then they rode and came east by Knafaholes, and Kolskegg said,
"Seest thou, kinsman! Many spears stand up by the holes, and men
with weapons."</p><br>

<p id="id01220">"It does not take me unawares," says Gunnar, "that my dream comes
true."</p><br>

<p id="id01221">"What is best to be done now?" says Kolskegg; "I guess thou wilt
not run away from them."</p><br>

<p id="id01222">"They shall not have that to jeer about," says Gunnar, "but we
will ride on down to the ness by Rangriver; there is some vantage
ground there."</p><br>

<p id="id01223">Now they rode on to the ness, and made them ready there, and as
they rode on past them, Kol called out and said, "Whither art
thou running to now, Gunnar?"</p><br>

<p id="id01224">But Kolskegg said, "Say the same thing farther on when this day
has come to an end."</p><br>

<h4 id="id01225" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<h3 id="id01227" style="margin-top: 3em">62. THE SLAYING OF HJORT AND FOURTEEN MEN</h3>

<p id="id01228">After that Starkad egged on his men, and then they turn down upon
them into the ness. Sigurd Swinehead came first and had a red
targe, but in his other hand he held a cutlass. Gunnar sees him
and shoots an arrow at him from his bow; he held the shield up
aloft when he saw the arrow flying high, and the shaft passes
through the shield and into his eye, and so came out at the nape
of his neck, and that was the first man slain.</p><br>

<p id="id01229">A second arrow Gunnar shot at Ulfhedinn, one of Starkad's men,
and that struck him about the middle and he fell at the feet of a
yeoman, and the yeoman over him. Kolskegg cast a stone and
struck the yeoman on the head, and that was his deathblow.</p><br>

<p id="id01230">Then Starkad said, "'Twill never answer our end that he should
use his bow, but let us come on well and stoutly." Then each man
egged on the other, and Gunnar guarded himself with his bow and
arrows as long as he could; after that he throws them down, and
then he takes his bill and sword and fights with both hands.
There is long the hardest fight, but still Gunnar and Kolskegg
slew man after man.</p><br>

<p id="id01231">Then Thorgeir, Starkad's son, said, "I vowed to bring Hildigunna
thy head, Gunnar."</p><br>

<p id="id01232">Then Gunnar sang a song:</p><br>

<p id="id01233">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou, that battle-sleet down bringeth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce I trow thou speakest truth;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, the girl with golden armlets,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot care for such a gift;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, O serpent's hoard despoiler!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the maid must have my head ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid whose wrist Rhine's fire (1) wreatheth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer come to crash of spear."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01234">"She will not think that so much worth having," says Gunnar; "but
still to get it thou wilt have to come nearer!"</p><br>

<p id="id01235">Thorgeir said to his brothers, "Let us run all of us upon him at
once; he has no shield and we shall have his life in our hands."</p><br>

<p id="id01236">So Bork and Thorkel both ran forward and were quicker than
Thorgeir. Bork made a blow at Gunnar, and Gunnar threw his bill
so hard in the way, that the sword flew out of Bork's hand; then
he sees Thorkel standing on his other hand within stroke of
sword. Gunnar was standing with his body swayed a little on one
side, and he makes a sweep with his sword, and caught Thorkel on
the neck, and off flew his head.</p><br>

<p id="id01237">Kol Egil's son, said, "Let me get at Kolskegg," and turning to
Kolskegg he said, "This I have often said, that we two would be
just about an even match in fight."</p><br>

<p id="id01238">"That we can soon prove," says Kolskegg.</p><br>

<p id="id01239">Kol thrust at him with his spear; Kolskegg had just slain a man
and had his hands full, and so he could not throw his shield
before the blow, and the thrust came upon his thigh, on the
outside of the limb and went through it.</p><br>

<p id="id01240">Kolskegg turned sharp round, and strode towards him, and smote
him with his short sword on the thigh, and cut off his leg, and
said, "Did it touch thee or not?"</p><br>

<p id="id01241">"Now," says Kol, "I pay for being bare of my shield."</p><br>

<p id="id01242">So he stood a while on his other leg and looked at the stump.</p><br>

<p id="id01243">"Thou needest not to look at it," said Kolskegg; "'tis even as
thou seest, the leg is off."</p><br>

<p id="id01244">Then Kol fell down dead.</p><br>

<p id="id01245">But when Egil sees this, he runs at Gunnar and makes a cut at
him; Gunnar thrusts at him with the bill and struck him in the
middle, and Gunnar hoists him up on the bill and hurls him out
into Rangriver.</p><br>

<p id="id01246">Then Starkad said, "Wretch that thou art indeed," Thorir
Easterling, "when thou sittest by; but thy host, and father-in-
law Egil, is slain."</p><br>

<p id="id01247">Then the Easterling sprung up and was very wroth. Hjort had been
the death of two men, and the Easterling leapt on him and smote
him full on the breast. Then Hjort fell down dead on the spot.</p><br>

<p id="id01248">Gunnar sees this and was swift to smite at the Easterling, and
cuts him asunder at the waist.</p><br>

<p id="id01249">A little while after Gunnar hurls the bill at Bork, and struck
him in the middle, and the bill went through him and stuck in the
ground.</p><br>

<p id="id01250">Then Kolskegg cut off Hauk Egil's son's head, and Gunnar smites
off Otter's hand at the elbow-joint. Then Starkad said, "Let us
fly now. We have not to do with men!"</p><br>

<p id="id01251">Gunnar said, "Ye two will think it a sad story if there is naught
on you to show that ye have both been in the battle."</p><br>

<p id="id01252">Then Gunnar ran after Starkad and Thorgeir, and gave them each a
wound. After that they parted; and Gunnar and his brothers had
then wounded many men who got away from the field, but fourteen
lost their lives, and Hjort the fifteenth.</p><br>

<p id="id01253">Gunnar brought Hjort home, laid out on his shield, and he was
buried in a cairn there. Many men grieved for him, for he had
many dear friends.</p><br>

<p id="id01254">Starkad came home, too, and Hildigunna dressed his wounds and
Thorgeir's, and said, "Ye would have given a great deal not to
have fallen out with Gunnar."</p><br>

<p id="id01255">"So we would," says Starkad.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01258" style="margin-top: 3em">63. NJAL'S COUNSEL TO GUNNAR</h3>

<p id="id01259">Steinvor, at Sandgil, besought Thorgrim the Easterling to take in
hand the care of her goods, and not to sail away from Iceland,
and so to keep in mind the death of his messmate and kinsman.</p><br>

<p id="id01260">"My messmate Thorir," said he, "foretold that I should fall by
Gunnar's hand if I stayed here in the land, and he must have
foreseen that when he foreknew his own death."</p><br>

<p id="id01261">"I will give thee," she says, "Gudruna my daughter to wife, and
all my goods into the bargain."</p><br>

<p id="id01262">"I knew not," he said, "that thou wouldest pay such a long
price."</p><br>

<p id="id01263">After that they struck the bargain that he shall have her, and
the wedding feast was to be the next summer.</p><br>

<p id="id01264">Now Gunnar rides to Bergthorsknoll, and Kolskegg with him. Njal
was out of doors and his sons, and they went to meet Gunnar and
gave them a hearty welcome. After that they fell a-talking, and
Gunnar said, "Hither am I come to seek good counsel and help at
thy hand."</p><br>

<p id="id01265">"That is thy due," said Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01266">"I have fallen into a great strait," says Gunnar, "and slain many
men, and I wish to know what thou wilt make of the matter?"</p><br>

<p id="id01267">"Many will say this," said Njal, "that thou hast been driven into
it much against thy will; but now thou shalt give me time to take
counsel with myself."</p><br>

<p id="id01268">Then Njal went away all by himself, and thought over a plan, and
came back and said, "Now have I thought over the matter somewhat,
and it seems to me as though this must be carried through ??? if
it be carried through at all ??? with hardihood and daring.
Thorgeir has got my kinswoman Thorfinna with child, and I will
hand over to thee the suit for seduction. Another suit of
outlawry against Starkad I hand over also to thee, for having
hewn trees in my wood on the Threecorner ridge. Both these suits
shalt thou take up. Thou shalt fare too, to the spot where ye
fought, and dig up the dead, and name witnesses to the wounds,
and make all the dead outlaws, for that they came against thee
with that mind to give thee and thy brothers wounds or swift
death. But if this be tried at the Thing, and it be brought up
against thee that thou first gave Thorgeir a blow, and so mayst
neither plead thine own cause nor that of others, then I will
answer in that matter, and say that I gave thee back thy rights
at the Thingskala-Thing, so that thou shouldest be able to plead
thine own suit as well as that of others, and then there will be
an answer to that point. Thou shalt also go to see Tyrfing of
Berianess, and he must hand over to thee a suit against Aunund of
Witchwood, who has the blood feud after his brother Egil."</p><br>

<p id="id01269">Then first of all Gunnar rode home; but a few nights after Njal's
sons and Gunnar rode thither where the bodies were, and dug them
up that were buried there. Then Gunnar summoned them all as
outlaws for assault and treachery, and rode home after that.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01270" style="margin-top: 3em">64. OF VALGARD AND MORD</h3>

<p id="id01271">That same harvest Valgard the Guileful came out to Iceland, and
fared home to Hof. Then Thorgeir went to see Valgard and Mord,
and told them what a strait they were in if Gunnar were to be
allowed to make all those men outlaws whom he had slain.</p><br>

<p id="id01272">Valgard said that must be Njal's counsel, and yet everything had
not come out yet which he was likely to have taught him.</p><br>

<p id="id01273">Then Thorgeir begged those kinsmen for help and backing, but they
held out a long while, and at last asked for, and got a large sum
of money.</p><br>

<p id="id01274">That, too, was part of their plan, that Mord should ask for
Thorkatla, Gizur the White's daughter, and Thorgeir was to ride
at once west across the river with Valgard and Mord.</p><br>

<p id="id01275">So the day after they rode twelve of them together and came to
Mossfell. There they were heartily welcomed, and they put the
question to Gizur about the wooing, and the end of it was that
the match should be made, and the wedding feast was to be in half
a month's space at Mossfell.</p><br>

<p id="id01276">They ride home, and after that they ride to the wedding and there
was a crowd of guests to meet them, and it went off well.
Thorkatla went home with Mord and took the housekeeping in hand,
but Valgard went abroad again the next summer.</p><br>

<p id="id01277">Now Mord eggs on Thorgeir to set his suit on foot against Gunnar,
and Thorgeir went to find Aunund; he bids him now to begin a suit
for manslaughter for his brother Egil and his sons; "but I will
begin one for the manslaughter of my brothers, and for the wounds
of myself and my father."</p><br>

<p id="id01278">He said he was quite ready to do that, and then they set out, and
give notice of the manslaughter, and summon nine neighbours who
dwelt nearest to the spot where the deed was done. This
beginning of the suit was heard of at Lithend; and then Gunnar
rides to see Njal, and told him, and asked what he wished them to
do next.</p><br>

<p id="id01279">"Now," says Njal, "thou shalt summon those who dwell next to the
spot, and thy neighbours; and call men to witness before the
neighbours, and choose out Kol as the slayer in the manslaughter
of Hjort thy brother: for that is lawful and right; then thou
shalt give notice of the suit for manslaughter at Kol's hand,
though he be dead. Then shalt thou call men to witness, and
summon the neighbours to ride to the Allthing to bear witness of
the fact, whether they, Kol and his companions, were on the spot,
and in onslaught when Hjort was slain. Thou shalt also summon
Thorgeir for the suit of seduction, and Aunund at the suit of
Tyrfing."</p><br>

<p id="id01280">Gunnar now did in everything as Njal gave him counsel. This men
thought a strange beginning of suits, and now these matters come
before the Thing. Gunnar rides to the Thing, and Njal's sons and
the sons of Sigfus. Gunnar had sent messengers to his cousins
and kinsmen, that they should ride to the Thing, and come with as
many men as they could, and told them that this matter would lead
to much strife. So they gathered together in a great band from
the west.</p><br>

<p id="id01281">Mord rode to the Thing and Runolf of the Dale, and those under
the Threecorner, and Aunund of Witchwood. But when they come to
the Thing, they join them in one company with Gizur the White and
Geir the Priest.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01282" style="margin-top: 3em">65. OF FINES AND ATONEMENTS</h3>

<p id="id01283">Gunnar, and the sons of Sigfus, and Njal's sons, went altogether
in one band, and they marched so swiftly and closely that men who
came in their way had to take heed lest they should get a fall;
and nothing was so often spoken about over the whole Thing as
these great lawsuits.</p><br>

<p id="id01284">Gunnar went to meet his cousins, and Olaf and his men greeted him
well. They asked Gunnar about the fight, but he told them all
about it, and was just in all he said; he told them, too, what
steps he had taken since.</p><br>

<p id="id01285">Then Olaf said, "'Tis worth much to see how close Njal stands by
thee in all counsel."</p><br>

<p id="id01286">Gunnar said he should never be able to repay that, but then he
begged them for help; and they said that was his due.</p><br>

<p id="id01287">Now the suits on both sides came before the court, and each
pleads his cause.</p><br>

<p id="id01288">Mord asked, "How it was that a man could have the right to set a
suit on foot who, like Gunnar, had already made himself an outlaw
by striking Thorgeir a blow?"</p><br>

<p id="id01289">"Wast thou," answered Njal, "at Thingskala-Thing last autumn?"</p><br>

<p id="id01290">"Surely I was," says Mord.</p><br>

<p id="id01291">"Heardest thou," asks Njal, "how Gunnar offered him full
atonement? Then I gave back Gunnar his right to do all lawful
deeds."</p><br>

<p id="id01292">"That is right and good law," says Mord, "but how does the matter
stand if Gunnar has laid the slaying of Hjort at Kol's door, when
it was the Easterling that slew him?"</p><br>

<p id="id01293">"That was right and lawful," says Njal, "when he chose him as the
slayer before witnesses."</p><br>

<p id="id01294">"That was lawful and right, no doubt," says Mord; "but for what
did Gunnar summon them all as outlaws?"</p><br>

<p id="id01295">"Thou needest not to ask about that," says Njal, "when they went
out to deal wounds and manslaughter."</p><br>

<p id="id01296">"Yes," says Mord, "but neither befell Gunnar."</p><br>

<p id="id01297">"Gunnar's brothers," said Njal, "Kolskegg and Hjort, were there,
and one of them got his death and the other a flesh wound."</p><br>

<p id="id01298">"Thou speakest nothing but what is law," says Mord, "though it is
hard to abide by it."</p><br>

<p id="id01299">Then Hiallti Skeggi's son of Thursodale, stood forth and said. "I
have had no share in any of your lawsuits; but I wish to know
whether thou wilt do something, Gunnar, for the sake of my words
and friendship."</p><br>

<p id="id01300">"What askest thou?" says Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01301">"This," he says, "that ye lay down the whole suit to the award
and judgment of good men and true."</p><br>

<p id="id01302">"If I do so," said Gunnar, "then thou shalt never be against me,
whatever men I may have to deal with."</p><br>

<p id="id01303">"I will give my word to that," says Hjallti.</p><br>

<p id="id01304">After that he tried his best with Gunnar's adversaries, and
brought it about that they were all set at one again. And after
that each side gave the other pledges of peace; but for
Thorgeir's wound came the suit for seduction, and for the hewing
in the wood, Starkad's wound. Thorgeir's brothers were atoned
for by half fines, but half fell away for the onslaught on
Gunnar. Egil's slaying and Tyrfing's lawsuit were set off
against each other. For Hjort's slaying, the slaying of Kol and
of the Easterling were to come, and as for all the rest, they
were atoned for with half fines.</p><br>

<p id="id01305">Njal was in this award, and Asgrim Ellidagrim's son, and Hjallti<br>

Skeggi's son.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01306">Njal had much money out at interest with Starkad, and at Sandgil
too, and he gave it all to Gunnar to make up these fines.</p><br>

<p id="id01307">So many friends had Gunnar at the Thing, that he not only paid up
there and then all the fines on the spot, but gave besides gifts
to many chiefs who had lent him help; and he had the greatest
honour from the suit; and all were agreed in this, that no man
was his match in all the South Quarter.</p><br>

<p id="id01308">So Gunnar rides home from the Thing and sits there in peace, but
still his adversaries envied him much for his honour.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01309" style="margin-top: 3em">66. OF THORGEIR OTKELL'S SON</h3>

<p id="id01310">Now we must tell of Thorgeir Otkell's son; he grew up to be a
tall strong man, true-hearted and guileless, but rather too ready
to listen to fair words. He had many friends among the best men,
and was much beloved by his kinsmen.</p><br>

<p id="id01311">Once on a time Thorgeir Starkad's son had been to see his kinsman<br>

Mord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01312">"I can ill brook," he says, "that settlement of matters which we
and Gunnar had, but I have bought thy help so long as we two are
above ground; I wish thou wouldest think out some plan and lay it
deep; this is why I say it right out, because I know that thou
art Gunnar's greatest foe, and he too thine. I will much
increase thine honour if thou takest pains in this matter."</p><br>

<p id="id01313">"It will always seem as though I were greedy of gain, but so it
must be. Yet it will be hard to take care that thou mayest not
seem to be a truce-breaker, or peace-breaker, and yet carry out
thy point. But now I have been told that Kolskegg means to try a
suit, and regain a fourth part of Moeidsknoll, which was paid to
thy father as an atonement for his son. He has taken up this
suit for his mother, but this too is Gunnar's counsel, to pay in
goods and not to let the land go. We must wait till this comes
about, and then declare that he has broken the settlement made
with you. He has also taken a cornfield from Thorgeir Otkell's
son, and so broken the settlement with him too. Thou shalt go to
see Thorgeir Otkell's son, and bring him into the matter with
thee, and then fall on Gunnar; but if ye fail in aught of this,
and cannot get him hunted down, still ye shall set on him over
and over again. I must tell thee that Njal has 'spaed' his
fortune, and foretold about his life, if he slays more than once
in the same stock, that it would lead him to his death, if it so
fell out that he broke the settlement made after the deed.
Therefore shalt thou bring Thorgeir into the suit, because he has
already slain his father; and now, if ye two are together in an
affray, thou shalt shield thyself; but he will go boldly on, and
then Gunnar will slay him. Then he has slain twice in the same
stock, but thou shalt fly from the fight. And if this is to drag
him to his death he will break the settlement afterwards, and so
we may wait till then."</p><br>

<p id="id01314">After that Thorgeir goes home and tells his father secretly.
Then they agreed among themselves that they should work out this
plot by stealth.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01315" style="margin-top: 3em">67. OF THORGEIR STARKAD'S SON</h3>

<p id="id01316">Sometime after Thorgeir Starkad's son fared to Kirkby to see his
namesake, and they went aside to speak, and talked secretly all
day; but at the end Thorgeir Starkad's son gave his namesake a
spear inlaid with gold, and rode home afterwards; they made the
greatest friendship the one with the other.</p><br>

<p id="id01317">At the Thingskala-Thing in the autumn, Kolskegg laid claim to the
land at Moeidsknoll, but Gunnar took witness, and offered ready
money, or another piece of land at a lawful price to those under
the Threecorner.</p><br>

<p id="id01318">Thorgeir took witness also, that Gunnar was breaking the
settlement made between them.</p><br>

<p id="id01319">After that the Thing was broken up, and so the next year wore
away.</p><br>

<p id="id01320">Those namesakes were always meeting, and there was the greatest
friendship between them. Kolskegg spoke to Gunnar and said, "I
am told that there is great friendship between those namesakes,
and it is the talk of many men that they will prove untrue, and I
would that thou wouldst be ware of thyself."</p><br>

<p id="id01321">"Death will come to me when it will come," says Gunnar, "wherever<br>

I may be, if that is my fate."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01322">Then they left off talking about it.</p><br>

<p id="id01323">About autumn, Gunnar gave out that they would work one week there
at home, and the next down in the isles, and so make an end of
their hay-making. At the same time, he let it be known that
every man would have to leave the house, save himself and the
women.</p><br>

<p id="id01324">Thorgeir under Threecorner goes to see his namesake, but as soon
as they met they began to talk after their wont, and Thorgeir
Starkad's son, said, "I would that we could harden our hearts
and fall on Gunnar."</p><br>

<p id="id01325">"Well," says Thorgeir Otkell's son, "every struggle with Gunnar
has had but one end, that few have gained the day; besides,
methinks it sounds ill to be called a peace-breaker."</p><br>

<p id="id01326">"They have broken the peace, not we," says Thorgeir Starkad's
son. "Gunnar took away from thee thy cornfield; and he has taken
Moeidsknoll from my father and me."</p><br>

<p id="id01327">And so they settle it between them to fall on Gunnar; and then
Thorgeir said that Gunnar would be all alone at home in a few
nights' space, "and then thou shalt come to meet me with eleven
men, but I will have as many."</p><br>

<p id="id01328">After that Thorgeir rode home.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01329" style="margin-top: 3em">68. OF NJAL AND THOSE NAMESAKES</h3>

<p id="id01330">Now when Kolskegg and the house-carles had been three nights in
the isles, Thorgeir Starkad's son had news of that, and sends
word to his namesake that he should come to meet him on
Threecorner ridge.</p><br>

<p id="id01331">After that Thorgeir of the Threecorner busked him with eleven
men; he rides up on the ridge and there waits for his namesake.</p><br>

<p id="id01332">And now Gunnar is at home in his house, and those namesakes ride
into a wood hard by. There such a drowsiness came over them that
they could do naught else but sleep. So they hung their shields
up in the boughs, and tethered their horses, and laid their
weapons by their sides.</p><br>

<p id="id01333">Njal was that night up in Thorolfsfell, and could not sleep at
all, but went out and in by turns.</p><br>

<p id="id01334">Thorhilda asked Njal why he could not sleep?</p><br>

<p id="id01335">"Many things now flit before my eyes," said he; "I see many
fetches of Gunnar's bitter foes, and what is very strange is
this, they seem to be mad with rage, and yet they fare without
plan or purpose."</p><br>

<p id="id01336">A little after, a man rode up to the door and got off his horse's
back and went in, and there was come the shepherd of Thorhilda
and her husband.</p><br>

<p id="id01337">"Didst thou find the sheep?" she asked.</p><br>

<p id="id01338">"I found what might be more worth," said he.</p><br>

<p id="id01339">"What was that?" asked Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01340">"I found twenty-four men up in the wood yonder; they had tethered
their horses, but slept themselves. Their shields they had hung
up in the boughs."</p><br>

<p id="id01341">But so closely had he looked at them that he told of all their
weapons and wargear and clothes, and then Njal knew plainly who
each of them must have been, and said to him, "'Twere good
hiring if there were many such shepherds; and this shall ever
stand to thy good; but still I will send thee on an errand."</p><br>

<p id="id01342">He said at once he would go.</p><br>

<p id="id01343">"Thou shalt go," says Njal, "to Lithend and tell Gunnar that he
must fare to Gritwater, and then send after men; but I will go to
meet with those who are in the wood and scare them away. This
thing hath well come to pass, so that they shall gain nothing by
this journey, but lose much."</p><br>

<p id="id01344">The shepherd set off and told Gunnar as plainly as he could the
whole story. Then Gunnar rode to Gritwater and summoned men to
him.</p><br>

<p id="id01345">Now it is to be told of Njal how he rides to meet these
namesakes.</p><br>

<p id="id01346">"Unwarily ye lie here," he says, "or for what end shall this
journey have been made? And Gunnar is not a man to be trifled
with. But if the truth must be told then, this is the greatest
treason. Ye shall also know this, that Gunnar is gathering
force, and he will come here in the twinkling of an eye, and slay
you all, unless ye ride away home."</p><br>

<p id="id01347">They bestirred them at once, for they were in great fear, and
took their weapons, and mounted their horses and galloped home
under the Threecorner.</p><br>

<p id="id01348">Njal fared to meet Gunnar and bade him not to break up his
company.</p><br>

<p id="id01349">"But I will go and seek for an atonement; now they will be finely
frightened; but for this treason no less a sum shall be paid when
one has to deal with all of them, than shall be paid for the
slaying of one or other of those namesakes, though such a thing
should come to pass. This money I will take into my keeping, and
so lay it out that it may be ready to thy hand when thou hast
need of it."</p><br>

<h3 id="id01350" style="margin-top: 3em">69. OLAF THE PEACOCK'S GIFTS TO GUNNAR</h3>

<p id="id01351">Gunnar thanked Njal for his aid, and Njal rode away under the
Threecorner, and told those namesakes that Gunnar would not break
up his band of men before he had fought it out with them.</p><br>

<p id="id01352">They began to offer terms for themselves, and were full of dread,
and bade Njal to come between them with an offer of atonement.</p><br>

<p id="id01353">Njal said that could only be if there were no guile behind. Then
they begged him to have a share in the award, and said they would
hold to what he awarded.</p><br>

<p id="id01354">Njal said he would make no award unless it were at the Thing, and
unless the best men were by; and they agreed to that.</p><br>

<p id="id01355">Then Njal came between them, so that they gave each other pledges
of peace and atonement.</p><br>

<p id="id01356">Njal was to utter the award, and to name as his fellows those
whom he chose.</p><br>

<p id="id01357">A little while after those namesakes met Mord Valgard's son, and
Mord blamed them much for having laid the matter in Njal's hands,
when he was Gunnar's great friend. He said that would turn out
ill for them.</p><br>

<p id="id01358">Now men ride to the Althing after their wont, and now both sides
are at the Thing.</p><br>

<p id="id01359">Njal begged for a hearing, and asked all the best men who were
come thither, what right at law they thought Gunnar had against
those namesakes for their treason. They said they thought such a
man had great right on his side.</p><br>

<p id="id01360">Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all
of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the
suit?</p><br>

<p id="id01361">They say that most of the blame would fall on the leaders, but a
great deal still on them all.</p><br>

<p id="id01362">"Many will say this," said Mord, "that it was not without a cause
when Gunnar broke the settlement made with those namesakes."</p><br>

<p id="id01363">"That is no breach of settlement," says Njal, "that any man
should take the law against another; for with law shall our land
be built up and settled, and with lawlessness wasted and
spoiled."</p><br>

<p id="id01364">Then Njal tells them that Gunnar had offered land for<br>

Moeidsknoll, or other goods.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01365">Then those namesakes thought they had been beguiled by Mord, and
scolded him much, and said that this fine was all his doing.</p><br>

<p id="id01366">Njal named twelve men as judges in the suit, and then every man
paid a hundred in silver who had gone out, but each of those
namesakes two hundred.</p><br>

<p id="id01367">Njal took this money into his keeping but either side gave the
other pledges of peace, and Njal gave out the terms.</p><br>

<p id="id01368">Then Gunnar rode from the Thing west to the Dales, till he came
to Hjardarholt, and Olaf the Peacock gave him a hearty welcome.
There he sat half a month, and rode far and wide about the Dales,
and all welcomed him with joyful hands. But at their parting
Olaf said, "I will give thee three things of price, a gold ring,
and a cloak which Moorkjartan the Erse king owned, and a hound
that was given me in Ireland; he is big, and no worse follower
than a sturdy man. Besides, it is part of his nature that he has
man's wit, and he will bay at every man whom he knows is thy foe,
but never at thy friends; he can see, too, in any man's face,
whether he means thee well or ill, and he will lay down his life
to be true to thee. This hound's name is Sam."</p><br>

<p id="id01369">After that he spoke to the hound, "Now shalt thou follow Gunnar,
and do him all the service thou canst."</p><br>

<p id="id01370">The hound went at once to Gunnar and laid himself down at his
feet.</p><br>

<p id="id01371">Olaf bade Gunnar to be ware of himself, and said he had many
enviers, "For now thou art thought to be a famous man throughout
all the land."</p><br>

<p id="id01372">Gunnar thanked him for his gifts and good counsel, and rode home.</p><br>

<p id="id01373">Now Gunnar sits at home for sometime, and all is quiet.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01374" style="margin-top: 3em">70. MORD'S COUNSEL</h3>

<p id="id01375">A little after, those namesakes and Mord met, and they were not
at all of one mind. They thought they had lost much goods for
Mord's sake, but had got nothing in return; and they bade him set
on foot some other plot which might do Gunnar harm.</p><br>

<p id="id01376">Mord said so it should be. "But now this is my counsel, that
thou, Thorgeir Otkell's son shouldest beguile Ormilda, Gunnar's
kinswoman; but Gunnar will let his displeasure grow against thee
at that, and then I will spread that story abroad that Gunnar
will not suffer thee to do such things. Then ye two shall some
time after make an attack on Gunnar, but still ye must not seek
him at home, for there is no thinking of that while the hound is
alive."</p><br>

<p id="id01377">So they settled this plan among them that it should be brought
about.</p><br>

<p id="id01378">Thorgeir began to turn his steps towards Ormilda, and Gunnar
thought that ill, and great dislike arose between them.</p><br>

<p id="id01379">So the winter wore away. Now comes the summer, and their secret
meetings went on oftener than before.</p><br>

<p id="id01380">As for Thorgeir of the Threecorner and Mord, they were always
meeting; and they plan an onslaught on Gunnar when he rides down
to the isles to see after the work done by his house-caries.</p><br>

<p id="id01381">One day Mord was ware of it when Gunnar rode down to the isles,
and sent a man off under the Threecorner to tell Thorgeir that
then would be the likeliest time to try to fall on Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01382">They bestirred them at once, and fare thence twelve together, but
when they came to Kirkby there they found thirteen men waiting
for them.</p><br>

<p id="id01383">Then they made up their minds to ride down to Rangriver and lie
in wait there for Gunnar.</p><br>

<p id="id01384">But when Gunnar rode up from the isles, Kolskegg rode with him.
Gunnar had his bow and his arrows and his bill. Kolskegg had his
short sword and weapons to match.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01385" style="margin-top: 3em">71. THE SLAYING OF THORGEIR OTKELL'S SON</h3>

<p id="id01386">That token happened as Gunnar and his brother rode up towards<br>

Rangriver, that much blood burst out on the bill.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01387">Kolskegg asked what that might mean.</p><br>

<p id="id01388">Gunnar says, "If such tokens took place in other lands, it was
called `wound-drops,' and Master Oliver told me also that this
only happened before great fights."</p><br>

<p id="id01389">So they rode on till they saw men sitting by the river on the
other side, and they had tethered their horses.</p><br>

<p id="id01390">Gunnar said, "Now we have an ambush."</p><br>

<p id="id01391">Kolskegg answered, "Long have they been faithless; but what is
best to be done now?"</p><br>

<p id="id01392">"We will gallop up alongside them to the ford," says Gunnar, "and
there make ready for them."</p><br>

<p id="id01393">The others saw that and turned at once towards them.</p><br>

<p id="id01394">Gunnar strings his bow, and takes his arrows and throws them on
the ground before him, and shoots as soon as ever they come
within shot; by that Gunnar wounded many men, but some he slew.</p><br>

<p id="id01395">Then Thorgeir Otkell's son spoke and said, "This is no use; let
us make for him as hard as we can."</p><br>

<p id="id01396">They did so, and first went Aunund the Fair, Thorgeir's kinsman.
Gunnar hurled the bill at him, and it fell on his shield and
clove it in twain, but the bill rushed through Aunund. Augmund
Shockhead rushed at Gunnar behind his back. Kolskegg saw that
and cut off at once both Augmund's legs from under him, and
hurled him out into Rangriver, and he was drowned there and then.</p><br>

<p id="id01397">Then a hard battle arose; Gunnar cut with one hand and thrust
with the other. Kolskegg slew some men and wounded many.</p><br>

<p id="id01398">Thorgeir Starkad's son called out to his namesake, "It looks very
little as though thou hadst a father to avenge."</p><br>

<p id="id01399">"True it is," he answers, "that I do not make much way, but yet
thou hast not followed in my footsteps; still I will not bear thy
reproaches."</p><br>

<p id="id01400">With that he rushes at Gunnar in great wrath, and thrust his
spear through his shield, and so on through his arm.</p><br>

<p id="id01401">Gunnar gave the shield such a sharp twist that the spearhead
broke short off at the socket. Gunnar sees that another man was
come within reach of his sword, and he smites at him and deals
him his death-blow. After that, he clutches his bill with both
hands; just then, Thorgeir Otkell's son had come near him with a
drawn sword, and Gunnar turns on him in great wrath, and drives
the bill through him, and lifts him up aloft, and casts him out
into Rangriver, and he drifts down towards the ford, and stuck
fast there on a stone; and the name of that ford has since been
Thorgeir's ford.</p><br>

<p id="id01402">Then Thorgeir Starkad's son said, "Let us fly now; no victory
will be fated to us this time."</p><br>

<p id="id01403">So they all turned and fled from the field.</p><br>

<p id="id01404">"Let us follow them up now," says Kolskegg "and take thou thy bow
and arrows, and thou wilt come within bowshot of Thorgeir
Starkad's son."</p><br>

<p id="id01405">Then Gunnar sang a song:</p><br>

<p id="id01406">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reaver of rich river-treasure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plundered will our purses be,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though to-day we wound no other<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors wight in play of spears<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, if I for all these sailors<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowly lying, fines must pay ???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I hold my hand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearken, brother dear, to me."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01407">"Our purses will be emptied," says Gunnar, "by the time that
these are atoned for who now lie here dead."</p><br>

<p id="id01408">"Thou wilt never lack money," says Kolskegg; "but Thorgeir will
never leave off before he compasses thy death."</p><br>

<p id="id01409">Gunnar sang another song:</p><br>

<p id="id01410">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord of water-skates (1) that skim<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-king's fields, more good as he,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shedding wounds' red stream, must stand<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my way ere I shall wince.<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id01411">"He, and a few more as good as he," says Gunnar, "must stand in
my path ere I am afraid of them."</p><br>

<p id="id01412">After that they ride home and tell the tidings. Hallgerda was
well pleased to hear them, and praised the deed much.</p><br>

<p id="id01413">Rannveig said, "May be the deed is good; but somehow," she says,<br>

"I feel too downcast about it to think that good can come of it."<br>

<h3 id="id01416" style="margin-top: 3em">72. OF THE SUITS FOR MANSLAUGHTER AT THE THING</h3>

<p id="id01417">These tidings were spread far and wide, and Thorgeir's death was
a great grief to many a man. Gizur the White and his men rode to
the spot and gave notice of the manslaughter, and called the
neighbours on the inquest to the Thing. Then they rode home
west.</p><br>

<p id="id01418">Njal and Gunnar met and talked about the battle. Then Njal said
to Gunnar, "Now be ware of thyself. Now hast thou slain twice in
the same stock; and so now take heed to thy behaviour, and think
that it is as much as thy life is worth, if thou dost not hold to
the settlement that is made."</p><br>

<p id="id01419">"Nor do I mean to break it in any way," says Gunnar, "but still I
shall need thy help at the Thing."</p><br>

<p id="id01420">"I will hold to my faithfulness to thee," said Njal, "till my
death day."</p><br>

<p id="id01421">Then Gunnar rides home. Now the Thing draws near; and each side
gather a great company; and it is a matter of much talk at the
Thing how these suits will end.</p><br>

<p id="id01422">Those two, Gizur the White, and Geir the Priest, talked with each
other as to who should give notice of the suit of manslaughter
after Thorgeir, and the end of it was that Gizur took the suit on
his hand, and gave notice of it at the Hill of Laws, and spoke in
these words: ???</p><br>

<p id="id01423">"I gave notice of a suit for assault laid down by law against
Gunnar Hamond's son; for that he rushed with an onslaught laid
down by law on Thorgeir Otkell's son, and wounded him with a body
wound, which proved a death wound, so that Thorgeir got his
death.</p><br>

<p id="id01424">"I say on this charge he ought to become a convicted outlaw, not
to be fed, not to be forwarded, not to be helped or harboured in
any need.</p><br>

<p id="id01425">"I say that his goods are forfeited, half to me and half to the
men of the Quarter, whose right it is by law to seize the goods
of outlaws.</p><br>

<p id="id01426">"I give notice of this charge in the Quarter Court, into which
this suit ought by law to come.</p><br>

<p id="id01427">"I give this lawful notice in the hearing of all men at the Hill
of Laws.</p><br>

<p id="id01428">"I give notice now of this suit, and of full forfeiture and
outlawry against Gunnar Hamond's son."</p><br>

<p id="id01429">A second time Gizur took witness, and gave notice of a suit
against Gunnar Hamond's son, for that he had wounded Thorgeir
Otkell's son with a body wound which was a death wound, and from
which Thorgeir got his death, on such and such a spot when Gunnar
first sprang on Thorgeir with an onslaught, laid down by law.</p><br>

<p id="id01430">After that he gave notice of this declaration as he had done of
the first. Then he asked in what Quarter Court the suit lay, and
in what house in the district the defendant dwelt.</p><br>

<p id="id01431">When that was over, men left the Hill of Laws, and all said that
he spoke well.</p><br>

<p id="id01432">Gunnar kept himself well in hand and said little or nothing.</p><br>

<p id="id01433">Now the Thing wears away till the day when the courts were to be
set.</p><br>

<p id="id01434">Then Gunnar stood looking south by the court of the men of<br>

Rangriver, and his men with him.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01435">Gizur stood looking north, and calls his witnesses, and bade
Gunnar to listen to his oath, and to his declaration of the suit,
and to all the steps and proofs which he meant to bring forward.
After that he took his oath, and then he brought forward the suit
in the same shape before the court, as he had given notice of it
before. Then he made them bring forward witness of the notice,
then he bade the neighbours on the inquest to take their seats,
and called upon Gunnar to challenge the inquest.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01436" style="margin-top: 3em">73. OF THE ATONEMENT</h3>

<p id="id01437">Then Njal spoke and said, "Now I can no longer sit still and take
no part. Let us go to where the neighbours sit on the inquest."</p><br>

<p id="id01438">They went thither and challenged four neighbours out of the
inquest, but they called on the five that were left to answer the
following question in Gunnar's favour, "Whether those namesakes
had gone out with that mind to the place of meeting to do Gunnar
a mischief if they could?"</p><br>

<p id="id01439">But all bore witness at once that so it was.</p><br>

<p id="id01440">Then Njal called this a lawful defence to the suit, and said he
would bring forward proof of it unless they gave over the suit to
arbitration.</p><br>

<p id="id01441">Then many chiefs joined in praying for an atonement, and so it
was brought about that twelve men should utter an award in the
matter.</p><br>

<p id="id01442">Then either side went and handselled this settlement to the
other. Afterwards the award was made, and the sum to be paid
settled, and it was all to be paid down then and there at the
Thing.</p><br>

<p id="id01443">But besides, Gunnar was to go abroad and Kolskegg with him, and
they were to be away three winters; but if Gunnar did not go
abroad when he had a chance of a passage, then he was to be slain
by the kinsmen of those whom he had killed.</p><br>

<p id="id01444">Gunnar made no sign, as though he thought the terms of atonement
were not good. He asked Njal for that money which he had handed
over to him to keep. Njal had laid the money out at interest and
paid it down all at once, and it just came to what Gunnar had to
pay for himself.</p><br>

<p id="id01445">Now they ride home. Gunnar and Njal rode both together from the
Thing, and then Njal said to Gunnar, "Take good care, messmate,
that thou keepest to this atonement, and bear in mind what we
have spoken about; for though thy former journey abroad brought
thee to great honour, this will be a far greater honour to thee.
Thou wilt come back with great glory, and live to be an old man,
and no man here will then tread on thy heel; but if thou dost not
fare away, and so breakest thy atonement, then thou wilt be slain
here in the land, and that is ill knowing for those who are thy
friends."</p><br>

<p id="id01446">Gunnar said he had no mind to break the atonement, and he rides
home and told them of the settlement.</p><br>

<p id="id01447">Rannveig said it was well that he fared abroad, for then they
must find some one else to quarrel with.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01448" style="margin-top: 3em">74. KOLSKEGG GOES ABROAD</h3>

<p id="id01449">Thrain Sigfus' son said to his wife that he meant to fare abroad
that summer. She said that was well. So he took his passage
with Hogni the White.</p><br>

<p id="id01450">Gunnar took his passage with Arnfin of the Bay; and Kolskegg was
to go with him.</p><br>

<p id="id01451">Grim and Helgi, Njal's sons, asked their father's leave to go
abroad too, and Njal said, "This foreign voyage ye will find hard
work, so hard that it will be doubtful whether ye keep your
lives; but still ye two will get some honour and glory, but it is
not unlikely that a quarrel will arise out of your journey when
ye come back."</p><br>

<p id="id01452">Still they kept on asking their father to let them go, and the
end of it was that he bade them go if they chose.</p><br>

<p id="id01453">Then they got them a passage with Bard the Black, and Olof
Kettle's son of Elda; and it is the talk of the whole country
that all the better men in that district were leaving it.</p><br>

<p id="id01454">By this time Gunnar's sons, Hogni and Grani, were grown up; they
were men of very different turn of mind. Grani had much of his
mother's temper, but Hogni was kind and good.</p><br>

<p id="id01455">Gunnar made men bear down the wares of his brother and himself to
the ship, and when all Gunnar's baggage had come down, and the
ship was all but "boun," then Gunnar rides to Bergthorsknoll, and
to other homesteads to see men, and thanked them all for the help
they had given him.</p><br>

<p id="id01456">The day after he gets ready early for his journey to the ship,
and told all his people that he would ride away for good and all,
and men took that much to heart, but still they said that they
looked to his coming back afterwards.</p><br>

<p id="id01457">Gunnar threw his arms round each of the household when he was
"boun," and every one of them went out of doors with him; he
leans on the butt of his spear and leaps into the saddle, and he
and Kolskegg ride away.</p><br>

<p id="id01458">They ride down along Markfleet, and just then Gunnar's horse
tripped and threw him off. He turned with his face up towards
the Lithe and the homestead at Lithend, and said, "Fair is the
Lithe; so fair that it has never seemed to me so fair; the corn
fields are white to harvest and the home mead is mown; and now I
will ride back home, and not fare abroad at all."</p><br>

<p id="id01459">"Do not this joy to thy foes," says Kolskegg, "by breaking thy
atonement, for no man could think thou wouldst do thus, and thou
mayst be sure that all will happen as Njal has said."</p><br>

<p id="id01460">"I will not go away any whither," said Gunnar, "and so I would
thou shouldest do too."</p><br>

<p id="id01461">"That shall not be," says Kolskegg; "I will never do a base thing
in this, nor in any thing else which is left to my good faith;
and this is that one thing that could tear us asunder; but tell
this to my kinsman and to my mother that I never mean to see
Iceland again, for I shall soon learn that thou art dead,
brother, and then there will be nothing left to bring me back."</p><br>

<p id="id01462">So they parted there and then. Gunnar rides home to Lithend, but<br>

Kolskegg rides to the ship, and goes abroad.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01463">Hallgerda was glad to see Gunnar when he came home, but his
mother said little or nothing.</p><br>

<p id="id01464">How Gunnar sits at home that fall and winter, and had not many
men with him.</p><br>

<p id="id01465">Now the winter leaves the farmyard. Olaf the Peacock asked
Gunnar and Hallgerda to come and stay with him; but as for the
farm, to put it into the hands of his mother and his son Hogni.</p><br>

<p id="id01466">Gunnar thought that a good thing at first, and agreed to it, but
when it came to the point he would not do it.</p><br>

<p id="id01467">But at the Thing next summer, Gizur the White, and Geir the
Priest, gave notice of Gunnar's outlawry at the Hill of Laws; and
before the Thing broke up Gizur summoned all Gunnar's foes to
meet in the "Great Rift." (1) He summoned Starkad under the
Threecorner, and Thorgeir his son; Mord and Valgard the Guileful;
Geir the Priest and Hjalti Skeggi's son; Thorbrand and Asbrand,
Thorleik's sons; Eyjulf, and Aunund his son. Aunund of Witchwood
and Thorgrim the Easterling of Sandgil.</p><br>

<p id="id01468">Then Gizur spoke and said, "I will make you all this offer, that
we go out against Gunnar this summer and slay him."</p><br>

<p id="id01469">"I gave my word to Gunnar," said Hjalti, "here at the Thing,
when he showed himself most willing to yield to my prayer, that I
would never be in any attack upon him; and so it shall be."</p><br>

<p id="id01470">Then Hjalti went away, but those who were left behind made up
their minds to make an onslaught on Gunnar, and shook hands on
the bargain, and laid a fine on any one that left the
undertaking.</p><br>

<p id="id01471">Mord was to keep watch and spy out when there was the best chance
of falling on him, and they were forty men in this league, and
they thought it would be a light thing for them to hunt down
Gunnar, now that Kolskegg was away, and Thrain and many other of
Gunnar's friends.</p><br>

<p id="id01472">Men ride from the Thing, and Njal went to see Gunnar, and told
him of his outlawry, and how an onslaught was planned against
him.</p><br>

<p id="id01473">"Methinks thou art the best of friends," says Gunnar; "thou
makest me aware of what is meant."</p><br>

<p id="id01474">"Now," says Njal, "I would that Skarphedinn should come to thy
house, and my son Hauskuld; they will lay down their lives for
thy life."</p><br>

<p id="id01475">"I will not," says Gunnar, "that thy sons should be slain for my
sake, and thou hast a right to look for other things from me."</p><br>

<p id="id01476">"All thy care will come to nothing," says Njal; "quarrels will
turn thitherward where my sons are as soon as thou art dead and
gone."</p><br>

<p id="id01477">"That is not unlikely," says Gunnar, "but still it would mislike
me that they fell into them for me; but this one thing I will ask
of thee, that ye see after my son Hogni, but I say naught of
Grani, for he does not behave himself much after my mind."</p><br>

<p id="id01478">Njal rode home, and gave his word to do that.</p><br>

<p id="id01479">It is said that Gunnar rode to all meetings of men, and to all
lawful Things, and his foes never dared to fall on him.</p><br>

<p id="id01480">And so some time went on that he went about as a free and
guiltless man.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01483" style="margin-top: 3em">75. THE RIDING TO LITHEND</h3>

<p id="id01484">Next autumn Mord Valgard's son sent word that Gunnar would be all
alone at home, but all his people would be down in the isles to
make an end of their haymaking. Then Gizur the White and Geir
the Priest rode east over the rivers as soon as ever they heard
that, and so east across the sands to Hof. Then they sent word
to Starkad under the Threecorner, and there they all met who were
to fall on Gunnar, and took counsel how they might best bring it
about.</p><br>

<p id="id01485">Mord said that they could not come on Gunnar unawares, unless
they seized the farmer who dwelt at the next homestead, whose
name was Thorkell, and made him go against his will with them to
lay hands on the hound Sam, and unless he went before them to the
homestead to do this.</p><br>

<p id="id01486">Then they set out east for Lithend, but sent to fetch Thorkell.
They seized him and bound him, and gave him two choices ??? one
that they would slay him, or else he must lay hands on the hound;
but he chooses rather to save his life, and went with them.</p><br>

<p id="id01487">There was a beaten sunk road, between fences, above the farm yard
at Lithend, and there they halted with their band. Master
Thorkell went up to the homestead, and the tyke lay on the top of
the house, and he entices the dog away with him into a deep
hollow in the path. Just then the hound sees that there are men
before them, and he leaps on Thorkell and tears his belly open.</p><br>

<p id="id01488">Aunund of Witchwood smote the hound on the head with his axe, so
that the blade sunk into the brain. The hound gave such a great
howl that they thought it passing strange, and he fell down dead.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01489" style="margin-top: 3em">76. GUNNAR'S SLAYING</h3>

<p id="id01490">Gunnar woke up in his hall and said, "Thou hast been sorely
treated, Sam, my fosterling, and this warning is so meant that
our two deaths will not be far apart."</p><br>

<p id="id01491">Gunnar's hall was made all of wood, and roofed with beams above,
and there were window-slits under the beams that carried the
roof, and they were fitted with shutters.</p><br>

<p id="id01492">Gunnar slept in a loft above the hall, and so did Hallgerda and
his mother.</p><br>

<p id="id01493">Now when they were come near to the house they knew not whether
Gunnar were at home, and bade that some one would go straight up
to the house and see if he could find out. But the rest sat them
down on the ground.</p><br>

<p id="id01494">Thorgrim the Easterling went and began to climb up on the hall;
Gunnar sees that a red kirtle passed before the windowslit, and
thrusts out the bill, and smote him on the middle. Thorgrim's
feet slipped from under him, and he dropped his shield, and down
he toppled from the roof.</p><br>

<p id="id01495">Then he goes to Gizur and his band as they sat on the ground.</p><br>

<p id="id01496">Gizur looked at him and said, "Well, is Gunnar at home?"</p><br>

<p id="id01497">"Find that out for yourselves," said Thorgrim; "but this I am
sure of, that his bill is at home," and with that he fell down
dead.</p><br>

<p id="id01498">Then they made for the buildings. Gunnar shot out arrows at
them, and made a stout defence, and they could get nothing done.
Then some of them got into the out houses and tried to attack him
thence, but Gunnar found them out with his arrows there also, and
still they could get nothing done.</p><br>

<p id="id01499">So it went on for a while, then they took a rest, and made a
second onslaught. Gunnar still shot out at them, and they could
do nothing, and fell off the second time. Then Gizur the White
said, "Let us press on harder; nothing comes of our onslaught."</p><br>

<p id="id01500">Then they made a third bout of it, and were long at it, and then
they fell off again.</p><br>

<p id="id01501">Gunnar said, "There lies an arrow outside on the wall, and it is
one of their shafts; I will shoot at them with it, and it will be
a shame to them if they get a hurt from their own weapons."</p><br>

<p id="id01502">His mother said, "Do not so, my son; nor rouse them again when
they have already fallen off from the attack."</p><br>

<p id="id01503">But Gunnar caught up the arrow and shot it after them, and struck
Eylif Aunund's son, and he got a great wound; he was standing all
by himself, and they knew not that he was wounded.</p><br>

<p id="id01504">"Out came an arm yonder," says Gizur, "and there was a gold ring
on it, and took an arrow from the roof, and they would not look
outside for shafts if there were enough in doors; and now ye
shall made a fresh onslaught."</p><br>

<p id="id01505">"Let us burn him house and all," said Mord.</p><br>

<p id="id01506">"That shall never be," says Gizur, "though I knew that my life
lay on it; but it is easy for thee to find out some plan, such a
cunning man as thou art said to be."</p><br>

<p id="id01507">Some ropes lay there on the ground, and they were often used to
strengthen the roof. Then Mord said, "Let us take the ropes and
throw one end over the end of the carrying beams, but let us
fasten the other end to these rocks and twist them tight with
levers, and so pull the roof off the hall."</p><br>

<p id="id01508">So they took the ropes and all lent a hand to carry this out, and
before Gunnar was aware of it, they had pulled the whole roof off
the hall.</p><br>

<p id="id01509">Then Gunnar still shoots with his bow so that they could never
come nigh him. Then Mord said again that they must burn the
house over Gunnar's head. But Gizur said, "I know not why thou
wilt speak of that which no one else wishes, and that shall never
be."</p><br>

<p id="id01510">Just then Thorbrand Thorleik's son, sprang up on the roof, and
cuts asunder Gunnar's bowstring. Gunnar clutches the bill with
both hands, and turns on him quickly and drives it through him,
and hurls him down on the ground.</p><br>

<p id="id01511">Then up sprung Asbrand his brother. Gunnar thrusts at him with
his bill, and he threw his shield before the blow, but the bill
passed clean through the shield and broke both his arms, and down
he fell from the wall.</p><br>

<p id="id01512">Gunnar had already wounded eight men and slain those twain (1).
By that time Gunnar had got two wounds, and all men said that he
never once winced either at wounds or death.</p><br>

<p id="id01513">Then Gunnar said to Hallgerda, "Give me two locks of thy hair,
and ye two, my mother and thou, twist them together into a
bowstring for me."</p><br>

<p id="id01514">"Does aught lie on it?" she says.</p><br>

<p id="id01515">"My life lies on it;" he said; "for they will never come to close
quarters with me if I can keep them off with my bow."</p><br>

<p id="id01516">"Well!" she says, "now I will call to thy mind that slap on the
face which thou gavest me; and I care never a whit whether thou
holdest out a long while or a short."</p><br>

<p id="id01517">Then Gunnar sang a song:</p><br>

<p id="id01518">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each who hurts the gory javelin<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath some honour of his own,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my helpmeet wimple-hooded<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurries all my fame to earth.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one owner of a war-ship<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often asks for little things,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman, fond of Frodi's flour (2),<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wends her hand as she is wont."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01519">"Every one has something to boast of," says Gunnar, "and I will
ask thee no more for this."</p><br>

<p id="id01520">"Thou behavest ill," said Rannveig, "and this shame shall long be
had in mind."</p><br>

<p id="id01521">Gunnar made a stout and bold defence, and now wounds other eight
men with such sore wounds that many lay at death's door. Gunnar
keeps them all off until he fell worn out with toil. Then they
wounded him with many and great wounds, but still he got away out
of their hands, and held his own against them a while longer, but
at last it came about that they slew him.</p><br>

<p id="id01522">Of this defence of his, Thorkell the Skald of Gota-Elf sang in
the verses which follow ???</p><br>

<p id="id01523">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have heard how south in Iceland<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunnar guarded well himself,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boldly battle's thunder wielding,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiercest foeman on the wave;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero of the golden collar,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixteen with the sword he wounded;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shock that Odin loveth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two before him tasted death."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01524">But this is what Thormod Olaf's son sang ???</p><br>

<p id="id01525">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None that scattered sea's bright sunbeams (3),<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won more glorious fame than Gunnar,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So runs fame of old in Iceland,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of fight when helms were crashing,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives of foeman twain he took,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wielding bitter steel he sorely<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounded twelve, and four besides."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01526">Then Gizur spoke and said, "We have now laid low to earth a
mighty chief, and hard work has it been, and the fame of this
defence of his shall last as long as men live in this land."</p><br>

<p id="id01527">After that he went to see Rannveig and said, "Wilt thou grant us
earth here for two of our men who are dead, that they may lie in
a cairn here?"</p><br>

<p id="id01528">"All the more willingly for two," she says, "because I wish with
all my heart I had to grant it to all of you."</p><br>

<p id="id01529">"It must be forgiven thee," he says, "to speak thus, for thou
hast had a great loss."</p><br>

<p id="id01530">Then he gave orders that no man should spoil or rob anything
there.</p><br>

<p id="id01531">After that they went away.</p><br>

<p id="id01532">Then Thorgeir Starkad's son said, "We may not be in our house at
home for the sons of Sigfus, unless thou Gizur or thou Geir be
here south some little while."</p><br>

<p id="id01533">"This shall be so," says Gizur, and they cast lots, and the lot
fell on Geir to stay behind.</p><br>

<p id="id01534">After that he came to the Point, and set up his house there; he
had a son whose name was Hroald; he was base born, and his
mother's name was Biartey (4); he boasted that he had given
Gunnar his death blow. Hroald was at the Point with his father.</p><br>

<p id="id01535">Thorgeir Starkad's son boasted of another wound which he had

<p id="id01536">Gizur sat at home at Mossfell. Gunnar's slaying was heard of,

a great grief to many a man.</p><br>

<p id="id01540">Njal could ill brook Gunnar's death, nor could the sons of Sigfus
brook it either.</p><br>

<p id="id01541">They asked whether Njal thought they had any right to give notice
of a suit of manslaughter for Gunnar, or to set the suit on foot.</p><br>

<p id="id01542">He said that could not be done, as the man had been outlawed; but
said it would be better worth trying to do something to wound
their glory, by slaying some men in vengeance after him.</p><br>

<p id="id01543">They cast a cairn over Gunnar, and made him sit upright in the
cairn. Rannveig would not hear of his bill being buried in the
cairn, but said he alone should have it as his own, who was ready
to avenge Gunnar. So no one took the bill.</p><br>

<p id="id01544">She was so hard on Hallgerda, that she was on the point of
killing her; and she said that she had been the cause of her
son's slaying.</p><br>

<p id="id01545">Then Hallgerda fled away to Gritwater, and her son Grani with
her, and they shared the goods between them; Hogni was to have
the land at Lithend and the homestead on it, but Grani was to
have the land let out on lease.</p><br>

<p id="id01546">Now this token happened at Lithend, that the neat-herd and the
serving-maid were driving cattle by Gunnar's cairn. They thought
that he was merry, and that he was singing inside the cairn.
They went home and told Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, of this token,
but she bade them go and tell Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01547">Then they went over to Bergthorsknoll and told Njal, but he made
them tell it three times over.</p><br>

<p id="id01548">After that, he had a long talk all alone with Skarphedinn; and<br>

Skarphedinn took his weapons and goes with them to Lithend.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01549">Rannveig and Hogni gave him a hearty welcome, and were very glad
to see him. Rannveig asked him to stay there some time, and he
said he would.</p><br>

<p id="id01550">He and Hogni were always together, at home and abroad. Hogni was
a brisk, brave man, well-bred and well-trained in mind and body,
but distrustful and slow to believe what he was told, and that
was why they dared not tell him of the token.</p><br>

<p id="id01551">Now those two, Skarphedinn and Hogni, were out of doors one
evening by Gunnar's cairn on the south side. The moon and stars
were shining clear and bright, but every now and then the clouds
drove over them. Then all at once they thought they saw the
cairn standing open, and lo! Gunnar had turned himself in the
cairn and looked at the moon. They thought they saw four lights
burning in the cairn, and none of them threw a shadow. They saw
that Gunnar was merry, and he wore a joyful face. He sang a
song, and so loud, that it might have been heard though they had
been further off.</p><br>

<p id="id01552">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He that lavished rings in largesse,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fights' red rain-drips fell,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright of face, with heart-strings hardy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hogni's father met his fate;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his brow with helmet shrouding,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing battle-shield, he spake,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I will die the prop of battle,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner die than yield an inch,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, sooner die than yield an inch.'"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01553">After that the cairn was shut up again.</p><br>

<p id="id01554">"Wouldst thou believe these tokens if Njal or I told them to
thee?" says Skarphedinn.</p><br>

<p id="id01555">"I would believe them," he says, "if Njal told them, for it is
said he never lies."</p><br>

<p id="id01556">"Such tokens as these mean much," says Skarphedinn, "when he
shows himself to us, he who would sooner die than yield to his
foes; and see how he has taught us what we ought to do."</p><br>

<p id="id01557">"I shall be able to bring nothing to pass," says Hogni, "unless
thou wilt stand by me."</p><br>

<p id="id01558">"Now," says Skarphedinn, "will I bear in mind how Gunnar behaved
after the slaying of your kinsman Sigmund; now I will yield you
such help as I may. My father gave his word to Gunnar to do that
whenever thou or thy mother had need of it."</p><br>

<p id="id01559">After that they go home to Lithend.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01560" style="margin-top: 3em">78. GUNNAR OF LITHEND AVENGED</h3>

<p id="id01561">"Now we shall set off at once," says Skarphedinn, "this very
night; for if they learn that I am here, they will be more wary
of themselves."</p><br>

<p id="id01562">"I will fulfil thy counsel," says Hogni.</p><br>

<p id="id01563">After that they took their weapons when all men were in their
beds. Hogni takes down the bill, and it gave a sharp ringing
sound.</p><br>

<p id="id01564">Rannveig sprang up in great wrath and said, "Who touches the
bill, when I forbade every one to lay hand on it?"</p><br>

<p id="id01565">"I mean," says Hogni, "to bring it to my father, that he may bear
it with him to Valhalla, and have it with him when the warriors
meet."</p><br>

<p id="id01566">"Rather shalt thou now bear it," she answered, "and avenge thy
father; for the bill has spoken of one man's death or more."</p><br>

<p id="id01567">Then Hogni went out, and told Skarphedinn all the words that his
grandmother had spoken.</p><br>

<p id="id01568">After that they fare to the Point, and two ravens flew along with
them all the way. They came to the Point while it was still
night. Then they drove the flock before them up to the house,
and then Hroald and Tjorfi ran out and drove the flock up the
hollow path, and had their weapons with them.</p><br>

<p id="id01569">Skarphedinn sprang up and said, "Thou needest not to stand and
think if it be really as it seems. Men are here."</p><br>

<p id="id01570">Then Skarphedinn smites Tjorfi his deathblow. Hroald had a spear
in his hand, and Hogni rushes at him; Hroald thrusts at him, but
Hogni hewed asunder the spear-shaft with his bill, and drives the
bill through him.</p><br>

<p id="id01571">After that they left them there dead, and turn away thence under
the Threecorner.</p><br>

<p id="id01572">Skarphedinn jumps up on the house and plucks the grass, and those
who were inside the house thought it was cattle that had come on
the roof. Starkad and Thorgeir took their weapons and upper
clothing, and went out and round about the fence of the yard.
But when Starkad sees Skarphedinn he was afraid, and wanted to
turn back.</p><br>

<p id="id01573">Skarphedinn cut him down by the fence. Then Hogni comes against<br>

Thorgeir and slays him with the bill.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01574">Thence they went to Hof, and Mord was outside in the field, and
begged for mercy, and offered them full atonement.</p><br>

<p id="id01575">Skarphedinn told Mord the slaying of those four men, and sang a
song:</p><br>

<p id="id01576">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four who wielded warlike weapons<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have slain, all men of worth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them at once, gold-greedy fellow,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt follow on the spot;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us press this pinch-purse so,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring fear into his heart;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wretch! reach out to Gunnar's son<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to settle all disputes."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01577">"And the like journey," says Skarphedinn, "shalt thou also fare,
or hand over to Hogni the right to make his own award, if he will
take these terms."</p><br>

<p id="id01578">Hogni said his mind had been made up not to come to any terms
with the slayers of his father; but still at last he took the
right to make his own award from Mord.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01579" style="margin-top: 3em">79. HOGNI TAKES AN ATONEMENT FOR GUNNAR'S DEATH</h3>

<p id="id01580">Njal took a share in bringing those who had the blood-feud after
Starkad and Thorgeir to take an atonement, and a district meeting
was called together, and men were chosen to make the award, and
every matter was taken into account, even the attack on Gunnar,
though he was an outlaw; but such a fine as was awarded, all that
Mord paid; for they did not close their award against him before
the other matter was already settled, and then they set off one
award against the other.</p><br>

<p id="id01581">Then they were all set at one again, but at the Thing there was
great talk, and the end of it was, that Geir the Priest and Hogni
were set at one again, and that atonement they held to ever
afterwards.</p><br>

<p id="id01582">Geir the Priest dwelt in the Lithe till his deathday, and he is
out of the story.</p><br>

<p id="id01583">Njal asked as a wife for Hogni Alfeida the daughter of Weatherlid
the Skald, and she was given away to him. Their son was Ari, who
sailed for Shetland, and took him a wife there; from him is come
Einar the Shetlander, one of the briskest and boldest of men.</p><br>

<p id="id01584">Hogni kept up his friendship with Njal, and he is now out of the
story.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01585" style="margin-top: 3em">80. OF KOLSKEGG: HOW HE WAS BAPTIZED</h3>

<p id="id01586">Now it is to be told of Kolskegg how he comes to Norway, and is
in the Bay east that winter. But the summer after he fares east
to Denmark, and bound himself to Sweyn Forkbeard the Dane-king,
and there he had great honour.</p><br>

<p id="id01587">One night he dreamt that a man came to him; he was bright and
glistening, and he thought he woke him up. He spoke, and said to
him, "Stand up and come with me."</p><br>

<p id="id01588">"What wilt thou with me?" he asks.</p><br>

<p id="id01589">"I will get thee a bride, and thou shalt be my knight."</p><br>

<p id="id01590">He thought he said yea to that, and after that he woke up.</p><br>

<p id="id01591">Then he went to a wizard and told him the dream, but he read it
so that he should fare to southern lands and become God's knight.</p><br>

<p id="id01592">Kolskegg was baptized in Denmark, but still he could not rest
there, but fared east to Russia, and was there one winter. Then
he fared thence out to Micklegarth (1), and there took service
with the Emperor. The last that was heard of him was, that he
wedded a wife there, and was captain over the Varangians, and
stayed there till his deathday; and he, too, is out of this
story.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01595" style="margin-top: 3em">81. OF THRAIN: HOW HE SLEW KOL</h3>

<p id="id01596">Now we must take up the story, and say how Thrain Sigfus' son
came to Norway. They made the land north in Helgeland, and held
on south to Drontheim, and so to Hlada (1). But as soon as Earl
Hacon heard of that, he sent men to them, and would know what men
were in the ship. They came back and told him who the men were.
Then the earl sent for Thrain Sigfus' son, and he went to see
him. The earl asked of what stock he might be. He said that he
was Gunnar of Lithend's near kinsman. The earl said, "That shall
stand thee in good stead; for I have seen many men from Iceland,
but none his match."</p><br>

<p id="id01597">"Lord," said Thrain, "is it your will that I should be with you
this winter?"</p><br>

<p id="id01598">The earl took to him, and Thrain was there that winter, and was
thought much of.</p><br>

<p id="id01599">There was a man named Kol, he was a great sea-rover. He was the
son of Asmund Ashside, east out of Smoland. He lay east in the
Gota-Elf, and had five ships, and much force.</p><br>

<p id="id01600">Thence Kol steered his course out of the river to Norway and
landed at Fold (2), in the bight of the "Bay," and came on
Hallvard Soti unawares, and found him in a loft. He kept them
off bravely till they set fire to the house, then he gave himself
up; but they slew him, and took there much goods, and sailed
thence to Lodese (3).</p><br>

<p id="id01601">Earl Hacon heard these tidings, and made them make Kol an outlaw
over all his realm, and set a price upon his head.</p><br>

<p id="id01602">Once on a time it so happened that the earl began to speak thus,
"Too far off from us now is Gunnar of Lithend. He would slay my
outlaw if he were here; but now the Icelanders will slay him, and
it is ill that he hath not fared to us."</p><br>

<p id="id01603">Then Thrain Sigfus' son answered, "I am not Gunnar, but still I
am near akin to him, and I will undertake this voyage."</p><br>

<p id="id01604">The earl said, "I should be glad of that, and thou shalt be very
well fitted out for the journey."</p><br>

<p id="id01605">After that his son Eric began to speak, and said, "Your word,
father, is good to many men, but fulfilling it is quite another
thing. This is the hardest undertaking; for this sea-rover is
tough and ill to deal with, wherefore thou wilt need to take
great pains, both as to men and ships for this voyage."</p><br>

<p id="id01606">Thrain said, "I will set out on this voyage, though it looks
ugly."</p><br>

<p id="id01607">After that the earl gave him five ships, and all well trimmed
and manned. Along with Thrain was Gunnar Lambi's son, and Lambi
Sigurd's son. Gunnar was Thrain's brother's son, and had come to
him young, and each loved the other much.</p><br>

<p id="id01608">Eric, the earl's son, went heartily along with them, and looked
after strength for them, both in men and weapons and made such
changes in them as he thought were needful. After they were
"boun," Eric got them a pilot. Then they sailed south along the
land; but wherever they came to land, the earl allowed them to
deal with whatever they needed as their own.</p><br>

<p id="id01609">So they held on east to Lodese, and then they heard that Kol was
gone to Denmark. Then they shaped their course south thither;
but when they came south to Helsingborg, they met men in a boat
who said that Kol was there just before them, and would be
staying there for a while.</p><br>

<p id="id01610">One day when the weather was good, Kol saw the ships as they
sailed up towards him, and said he had dreamt of Earl Hacon the
night before, and told his people he was sure these must be his
men, and bade them all to take their weapons.</p><br>

<p id="id01611">After that they busked them, and a fight arose; and they fought
long, so that neither side had the mastery.</p><br>

<p id="id01612">Then Kol sprang up on Thrain's ship, and cleared the gangways
fast, and slays many men. He had a gilded helm.</p><br>

<p id="id01613">Now Thrain sees that this is no good, and now he eggs on his men
to go along with him, but he himself goes first and meets Kol.</p><br>

<p id="id01614">Kol hews at him, and the blow fell on Thrain's shield, and cleft
it down from top to bottom. Then Kol got a blow on the arm, from
a stone and then down fell his sword.</p><br>

<p id="id01615">Thrain hews at Kol, and the stroke came on his leg so that it cut
it off. After that they slew Kol, and Thrain cut off his head,
and they threw the trunk overboard, but kept his head.</p><br>

<p id="id01616">They took much spoil, and then they held on north to Drontheim,
and go to see the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01617">The earl gave Thrain a hearty welcome, and he shewed the earl<br>

Kol's head, but the earl thanked him for that deed.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01618">Eric said it was worth more than words alone, and the earl said
so it was, and bade them come along with him.</p><br>

<p id="id01619">They went thither, where the earl had made them make a good ship
that was not made like a common long-ship. It had a vulture's
head, and was much carved and painted.</p><br>

<p id="id01620">"Thou art a great man for show, Thrain," said the earl, "and so
have both of you, kinsmen, been, Gunnar and thou; and now I will
give thee this ship, but it is called the Vulture. Along with it
shall go my friendship; and my will is that thou stayest with me
as long as thou wilt."</p><br>

<p id="id01621">He thanked him for his goodness, and said he had no longing to go
to Iceland just yet.</p><br>

<p id="id01622">The earl had a journey to make to the marches of the land to meet
the Swede-king. Thrain went with him that summer, and was a
shipmaster and steered the Vulture, and sailed so fast that few
could keep up with him, and he was much envied. But it always
came out that the earl laid great store on Gunnar, for he set
down sternly all who tried Thrain's temper.</p><br>

<p id="id01623">So Thrain was all that winter with the earl, but next spring the
earl asked Thrain whether he would stay there or fare to Iceland;
but Thrain said he had not yet made up his mind, and said that he
wished first to know tidings from Iceland.</p><br>

<p id="id01624">The earl said that so it should be as he thought it suited him
best; and Thrain was with the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01625">Then those tidings were heard from Iceland, which many thought
great news, the death of Gunnar of Lithend. Then the earl would
not that Thrain should fare out of Iceland, and so there he
stayed with him.</p><br>

<p id="id01629">Now it must be told how Njal's sons, Grim and Helgi, left Iceland
the same summer that Thrain and his fellows went away; and in the
ship with them were Olaf Kettle's son of Elda, and Bard the
Black. They got so strong a wind from the north that they were
driven south into the main; and so thick a mist came over them
that they could not tell whither they were driving, and they were
out a long while. At last they came to where was a great ground
sea, and thought then they must be near land. So then Njal's
sons asked Bard if he could tell at all to what land they were
likely to be nearest.</p><br>

<p id="id01630">"Many lands there are," said he, "which we might hit with the
weather we have had ??? the Orkneys, or Scotland, or Ireland."</p><br>

<p id="id01631">Two nights after, they saw land on both boards, and a great
surf running up in the firth. They cast anchor outside the
breakers, and the wind began to fall; and next morning it was
calm. Then they see thirteen ships coming out to them.</p><br>

<p id="id01632">Then Bard spoke and said, "What counsel shall we take now, for
these men are going to make an onslaught on us?"</p><br>

<p id="id01633">So they took counsel whether they should defend themselves or
yield, but before they could make up their minds, the Vikings
were upon them. Then each side asked the other their names, and
what their leaders were called. So the leaders of the chapmen
told their names, and asked back who led that host. One called
himself Gritgard, and the other Snowcolf, sons of Moldan of
Duncansby in Scotland, kinsmen of Malcolm the Scot king.</p><br>

<p id="id01634">"And now," says Gritgard, "we have laid down two choices, one
that ye go on shore, and we will take your goods; the other is,
that we fall on you and slay every man that we can catch."</p><br>

<p id="id01635">"The will of the chapmen," answers Helgi, "is to defend
themselves."</p><br>

<p id="id01636">But the chapmen called out, "Wretch that thou art to speak thus!<br>

What defence can we make? Lading is less than life."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01637">But Grim, he fell upon a plan to shout out to the Vikings, and
would not let them hear the bad choice of the chapmen.</p><br>

<p id="id01638">Then Bard and Olaf said, "Think ye not that these Icelanders will
make game of you sluggards; take rather your weapons and guard
your goods."</p><br>

<p id="id01639">So they all seized their weapons, and bound themselves, one with
another, never to give up so long as they had strength to fight.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01640" style="margin-top: 3em">83. OF KARI SOLMUND'S SON</h3>

<p id="id01641">Then the Vikings shot at them and the fight began, and the
chapmen guard themselves well. Snowcolf sprang aboard and at
Olaf, and thrust his spear through his body, but Grim thrust at
Snowcolf with his spear, and so stoutly, that he fell overboard.
Then Helgi turned to meet Grim, and they two drove down all the
Vikings as they tried to board, and Njal's sons were ever where
there was most need. Then the Vikings called out to the chapmen
and bade them give up, but they said they would never yield.
Just then some one looked seaward, and there they see ships
coming from the south round the Ness, and they were not fewer
than ten, and they row hard and steer thitherwards. Along their
sides were shield on shield, but on that ship that came first
stood a man by the mast, who was clad in a silken kirtle, and had
a gilded helm, and his hair was both fair and thick; that man had
a spear inlaid with gold in his hand.</p><br>

<p id="id01642">He asked, "Who have here such an uneven game?"</p><br>

<p id="id01643">Helgi tells his name, and said that against them are Gritgard and<br>

Snowcolf.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01644">"But who are your captains?" he asks.</p><br>

<p id="id01645">Helgi answered, "Bard the Black, who lives, but the other, who
is dead and gone, was called Olaf."</p><br>

<p id="id01646">"Are ye men from Iceland?" says he.</p><br>

<p id="id01647">"Sure enough we are," Helgi answers.</p><br>

<p id="id01648">He asked whose sons they were, and they told him, then he knew
them and said, "Well known names have ye all, father and sons
both."</p><br>

<p id="id01649">"Who art thou?" asks Helgi.</p><br>

<p id="id01650">"My name is Kari, and I am Solmund's son."</p><br>

<p id="id01651">"Whence comest thou?" says Helgi.</p><br>

<p id="id01652">"From the Southern Isles."</p><br>

<p id="id01653">"Then thou art welcome," says Helgi, "if thou wilt give us a
little help."</p><br>

<p id="id01654">"I'll give ye all the help ye need," says Kari; "but what do
ye ask?"</p><br>

<p id="id01655">"To fall on them," says Helgi.</p><br>

<p id="id01656">Kari says that so it shall be. So they pulled up to them, and
then the battle began the second time; but when they had fought a
little while, Kari springs up on Snowcolf's ship; he turns to
meet him and smites at him with his sword. Kari leaps nimbly
backwards over a beam that lay athwart the ship, and Snowcolf
smote the beam so that both edges of the sword were hidden. Then
Kari smites at him, and the sword fell on his shoulder, and the
stroke was so mighty that he cleft in twain shoulder, arm, and
all, and Snowcolf got his death there and then. Gritgard hurled
a spear at Kari, but Kari saw it and sprang up aloft, and the
spear missed him. Just then Helgi and Grim came up both to meet
Kari, and Helgi springs on Gritgard and thrusts his spear through
him, and that was his death blow; after that they went round the
whole ship on both boards, and then men begged for mercy. So
they gave them all peace, but took all their goods. After that
they ran all the ships out under the islands.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01657" style="margin-top: 3em">84. OF EARL SIGURD</h3>

<p id="id01658">Sigurd was the name of an earl who ruled over the Orkneys; he was
the son of Hlodver, the son of Thorfinn the skullsplitter, the
son of Turf-Einar, the son of Rognvald, Earl of Moeren, the son
of Eystein the Noisy. Kari was one of Earl Sigurd's body-guard,
and had just been gathering scatts in the Southern Isles from
Earl Gilli. Now Kari asks them to go to Hrossey (1), and said
the earl would take to them well. They agreed to that, and went
with Kari and came to Hrossey. Kari led them to see the earl,
and said what men they were.</p><br>

<p id="id01659">"How came they," says the earl, "to fall upon thee?"</p><br>

<p id="id01660">"I found them," says Kari, "in Scotland's firths, and they were
fighting with the sons of Earl Moldan, and held their own so well
that they threw themselves about between the bulwarks, from side
to side, and were always there where the trial was greatest, and
now I ask you to give them quarters among your body-guard."</p><br>

<p id="id01661">"It shall be as thou choosest," says the earl, "thou hast already
taken them so much by the hand."</p><br>

<p id="id01662">Then they were there with the earl that winter, and were worthily
treated, but Helgi was silent as the winter wore on. The earl
could not tell what was at the bottom of that, and asked why he
was so silent, and what was on his mind. "Thinkest thou it not
good to be here?"</p><br>

<p id="id01663">"Good, methinks, it is here," he says.</p><br>

<p id="id01664">"Then what art thou thinking about?" asks the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01665">"Hast thou any realm to guard in Scotland?" asks Helgi.</p><br>

<p id="id01666">"So we think," says the earl, "but what makes thee think about
that, or what is the matter with it?"</p><br>

<p id="id01667">"The Scots," says Helgi, "must have taken your steward's life,
and stopped all the messengers, that none should cross the
Pentland Firth."</p><br>

<p id="id01668">"Hast thou the second sight?" said the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01669">"That has been little proved," answers Helgi.</p><br>

<p id="id01670">"Well," says the earl, "I will increase thy honour if this be so,
otherwise thou shalt smart for it."</p><br>

<p id="id01671">"Nay," says Kari, "Helgi is not that kind of man, and like enough
his words are sooth, for his father has the second sight."</p><br>

<p id="id01672">After that the earl sent men south to Straumey (2) to Arnljot,
his steward there, and after that Arnljot sent them across the
Pentland Firth, and they spied out and learnt that Earl Hundi and
Earl Melsnati had taken the life of Havard in Thraswick, Earl
Sigurd's brother-in-law. So Arnljot sent word to Earl Sigurd to
come south with a great host and drive those earls out of his
realm, and as soon as the earl heard that, he gathered together a
mighty host from all the isles.</p><br>

<h4 id="id01673" style="margin-top: 2em">ENDNOTES:</h4>

<p id="id01674">(1) The mainland of Orkney, now Pomona.

<h3 id="id01675" style="margin-top: 3em">85. THE BATTLE WITH THE EARLS</h3>

<p id="id01676">After that the earl set out south with his host, and Kari went
with him, and Njal's sons too. They came south to Caithness.
The earl had these realms in Scotland, Ross and Moray,
Sutherland, and the Dales. There came to meet them men from
those realms, and said that the earls were a short way off with a
great host. Then Earl Sigurd turns his host thither, and the
name of that place is Duncansness above which they met, and it
came to a great battle between them. Now the Scots had let some
of their host go free from the main battle, and these took the
earl's men in flank, and many men fell there till Njal's sons
turned against the foe, and fought with them and put them to
flight; but still it was a hard fight, and then Njal's sons
turned back to the front by the earl's standard, and fought well.
Now Kari turns to meet Earl Melsnati, and Melsnati hurled a spear
at him, but Kari caught the spear and threw it back and through
the earl. Then Earl Hundi fled, but they chased the fleers until
they learnt that Malcolm was gathering a host at Duncansby. Then
the earl took counsel with his men, and it seemed to all the best
plan to turn back, and not to fight with such a mighty land
force; so they turned back. But when the earl came to Staumey
they shared the battle-spoil. After that he went north to
Hrossey, and Njal's sons and Kari followed him. Then the earl
made a great feast, and at that feast he gave Kari a good sword,
and a spear inlaid with gold; but he gave Helgi a gold ring and a
mantle, and Grim a shield and sword. After that he took Helgi
and Grim into his body-guard, and thanked them for their good
help. They were with the earl that winter and the summer after,
till Kari went sea-roving; then they went with him, and harried
far and wide that summer, and everywhere won the victory. They
fought against Godred, King of Man, and conquered him; and after
that they fared back, and had gotten much goods. Next winter
they were still with the earl, and when the spring came Njal's
sons asked leave to go to Norway. The earl said they should go
or not as they pleased, and he gave them a good ship and smart
men. As for Kari, he said he must come that summer to Norway
with Earl Hacon's scatts, and then they would meet; and so it
fell out that they gave each other their word to meet. After
that Njal's sons put out to sea and sailed for Norway, and made
the land north near Drontheim.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01677" style="margin-top: 3em">86. HRAPP'S VOYAGE FROM ICELAND</h3>

<p id="id01678">There was a man named Kolbein, and his surname was Arnljot's son;
he was a man from Drontheim; he sailed out to Iceland that same
summer in which Kolskegg and Njal's sons went abroad. He was
that winter east in Broaddale; but the spring after, he made his
ship ready for sea in Gautawick; and when men were almost "boun,"
a man rowed up to them in a boat, and made the boat fast to the
ship, and afterwards he went on board the ship to see Kolbein.</p><br>

<p id="id01679">Kolbein asked that man for his name.</p><br>

<p id="id01680">"My name is Hrapp," says he.</p><br>

<p id="id01681">"What wilt thou with me?" says Kolbein.</p><br>

<p id="id01682">"I wish to ask thee to put me across the Iceland main."</p><br>

<p id="id01683">"Whose son art thou?" asks Kolbein.</p><br>

<p id="id01684">"I am a son of Aurgunleid, the son of Geirolf the Fighter."</p><br>

<p id="id01685">"What need lies on thee," asked Kolbein, "to drive thee abroad?"</p><br>

<p id="id01686">"I have slain a man," says Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01687">"What manslaughter was that," says Kolbein, "and what men have
the blood-feud?"</p><br>

<p id="id01688">"The men of Weaponfirth," says Hrapp, "but the man I slew was<br>

Aurlyg, the son of Aurlyg, the son of Roger the White."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01689">"I guess this," says Kolbein, "that he will have the worst of it
who bears thee abroad."</p><br>

<p id="id01690">"I am the friend of my friend," said Hrapp, "but when ill is done
to me I repay it. Nor am I short of money to lay down for my
passage."</p><br>

<p id="id01691">Then Kolbein took Hrapp on board, and a little while after a fair
breeze sprung up, and they sailed away on the sea.</p><br>

<p id="id01692">Hrapp ran short of food at sea and then he sate him down at the
mess of those who were nearest to him. They sprang up with ill
words, and so it was that they came to blows, and Hrapp, in a
trice, has two men under him.</p><br>

<p id="id01693">Then Kolbein was told, and he bade Hrapp to come and share his
mess, and he accepted that.</p><br>

<p id="id01694">Now they come off the sea, and lie outside off Agdirness.</p><br>

<p id="id01695">Then Kolbein asked where that money was which he had offered to
pay for his fare?</p><br>

<p id="id01696">"It is out in Iceland," answers Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01697">"Thou wilt beguile more men than me, I fear," says Kolbein; "but
now I will forgive thee all the fare."</p><br>

<p id="id01698">Hrapp bade him have thanks for that. "But what counsel dost thou
give as to what I ought to do?"</p><br>

<p id="id01699">"That first of all," he says, "that thou goest from the ship as
soon as ever thou canst, for all Easterlings will bear thee bad
witness; but there is yet another bit of good counsel which I
will give thee, and that is, never to cheat thy master."</p><br>

<p id="id01700">Then Hrapp went on shore with his weapons, and he had a great axe
with an iron-bound haft in his hand.</p><br>

<p id="id01701">He fares on and on till he comes to Gudbrand of the Dale. He was
the greatest friend of Earl Hacon. They two had a shrine between
them, and it was never opened but when the earl came thither.
That was the second greatest shrine in Norway, but the other was
at Hlada.</p><br>

<p id="id01702">Thrand was the name of Gudbrand's son, but his daughter's name
was Gudruna.</p><br>

<p id="id01703">Hrapp went in before Gudbrand, and hailed him well.</p><br>

<p id="id01704">He asked whence he came and what was his name. Hrapp told him
about himself, and how he had sailed abroad from Iceland.</p><br>

<p id="id01705">After that he asks Gudbrand to take him into his household as a
guest.</p><br>

<p id="id01706">"It does not seem," said Gudbrand, "to look on thee, as thou wert
a man to bring good luck."</p><br>

<p id="id01707">"Methinks, then," says Hrapp, "that all I have heard about thee
has been great lies; for it is said that thou takest every one
into thy house that asks thee; and that no man is thy match for
goodness and kindness, far or near; but now I shall have to speak
against that saying, if thou dost not take me in."</p><br>

<p id="id01708">"Well, thou shalt stay here," said Gudbrand.</p><br>

<p id="id01709">"To what seat wilt thou shew me?" says Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01710">"To one on the lower bench, over against my high seat."</p><br>

<p id="id01711">Then Hrapp went and took his seat. He was able to tell of many
things, and so it was at first that Gudbrand and many thought it
sport to listen to him; but still it came about that most men
thought him too much given to mocking, and the end of it was that
he took to talking alone with Gudruna, so that many said that he
meant to beguile her.</p><br>

<p id="id01712">But when Gudbrand was aware of that, he scolded her much for
daring to talk alone with him, and bade her beware of speaking
aught to him if the whole household did not hear it. She gave
her word to be good at first, but still it was soon the old story
over again as to their talk. Then Gudbrand got Asvard, his
overseer, to go about with her, out of doors and in, and to be
with her wherever she went. One day it happened that she begged
for leave to go into the nutwood for a pastime, and Asvard went
along with her. Hrapp goes to seek for them and found them, and
took her by the hand, and led her away alone.</p><br>

<p id="id01713">Then Asvard went to look for her, and found them both together
stretched on the grass in a thicket.</p><br>

<p id="id01714">He rushes at them, axe in air, and smote at Hrapp's leg, but
Hrapp gave himself a sudden turn, and he missed him. Hrapp
springs on his feet as quick as he can, and caught up his axe.
Then Asvard wished to turn and get away, but Hrapp hewed asunder
his back-bone.</p><br>

<p id="id01715">Then Gudruna said, "Now hast thou done that deed which will
hinder thy stay any longer with my father; but still there is
something behind which he will like still less, for I go with
child."</p><br>

<p id="id01716">"He shall not learn this from others," says Hrapp, "but I will go
home and tell him both these tidings."</p><br>

<p id="id01717">"Then," she says, "thou wilt not come away with thy life."</p><br>

<p id="id01718">"I will run the risk of that," he says.</p><br>

<p id="id01719">After that he sees her back to the other women, but he went home.
Gudbrand sat in his high seat, and there were few men in the
room.</p><br>

<p id="id01720">Hrapp went in before him, and bore his axe high.</p><br>

<p id="id01721">"Why is thine axe bloody?" asks Gudbrand.</p><br>

<p id="id01722">"I made it so by doing a piece of work on thy overseer Asvard's
back," says Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01723">"That can be no good work," says Gudbrand; "thou must have slain
him."</p><br>

<p id="id01724">"So it is, be sure," says Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01725">"What did ye fall out about?" asks Gudbrand.</p><br>

<p id="id01726">"Oh!" says Hrapp, "what you would think small cause enough. He
wanted to hew off my leg."</p><br>

<p id="id01727">"What hadst thou done first?" asked Gudbrand.</p><br>

<p id="id01728">"What he had no right to meddle with," says Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01729">"Still thou wilt tell me what it was."</p><br>

<p id="id01730">"Well!" said Hrapp, "if thou must know, I lay by thy daughter's
side, and he thought that bad."</p><br>

<p id="id01731">"Up men!" cried Gudbrand, "and take him. He shall be slain out
of hand."</p><br>

<p id="id01732">"Very little good wilt thou let me reap of my son-in-lawship,"
says Hrapp, "but thou hast not so many men at thy back as to do
that speedily."</p><br>

<p id="id01733">Up they rose, but he sprang out of doors. They run after him,
but he got away to the wood, and they could not lay hold of him.</p><br>

<p id="id01734">Then Gudbrand gathers people, and lets the wood be searched; but
they find him not, for the wood was great and thick.</p><br>

<p id="id01735">Hrapp fares through the wood till he came to a clearing; there he
found a house, and saw a man outside cleaving wood.</p><br>

<p id="id01736">He asked that man for his name, and he said his name was Tofi.</p><br>

<p id="id01737">Tofi asked him for his name in turn, and Hrapp told him his true
name.</p><br>

<p id="id01738">Hrapp asked why the householder had set up his abode so far from
other men?</p><br>

<p id="id01739">"For that here," he says, "I think I am less likely to have
brawls with other men."</p><br>

<p id="id01740">"It is strange how we beat about the bush in our talk," says
Hrapp, "but I will first tell thee who I am. I have been with
Gudbrand of the Dale, but I ran away thence because I slew his
overseer; but now I know that we are both of us bad men; for thou
wouldst not have come hither away from other men unless thou wert
some man's outlaw. And now I give thee two choices, either that
I will tell where thou art, or that we two have between us, share
and share alike, all that is here."</p><br>

<p id="id01741">"This is even as thou sayest," said the householder; "I seized
and carried off this woman who is here with me, and many men have
sought for me."</p><br>

<p id="id01742">Then he led Hrapp in with him; there was a small house there, but
well built.</p><br>

<p id="id01743">The master of the house told his mistress that he had taken Hrapp
into his company.</p><br>

<p id="id01744">"Most men will get ill luck from this man," she says; "but thou
wilt have thy way."</p><br>

<p id="id01745">So Hrapp was there after that. He was a great wanderer, and was
never at home. He still brings about meetings with Gudruna; her
father and brother, Thrand and Gudbrand, lay in wait for him, but
they could never get nigh him, and so all that year passed away.</p><br>

<p id="id01746">Gudbrand sent and told Earl Hacon what trouble he had had with
Hrapp, and the earl let him be made an outlaw, and laid a price
upon his head. He said, too, that he would go himself to look
after him; but that passed off, and the earl thought it easy
enough for them to catch him when he went about so unwarily.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01747" style="margin-top: 3em">87. THRAIN TOOK TO HRAPP</h3>

<p id="id01748">That same summer Njal's sons fared to Norway from the Orkneys, as
was before written, and they were there at the fair during the
summer. Then Thrain Sigfus' son busked his ship for Iceland, and
was all but "boun." At that time Earl Hacon went to a feast at
Gudbrand's house. That night Killing-Hrapp came to the shrine of
Earl Hacon and Gudbrand, and he went inside the house, and there
he saw Thorgerda Shrinebride sitting, and she was as tall as a
fullgrown man. She had a great gold ring on her arm, and a
wimple on her head; he strips her of her wimple, and takes the
gold ring from off her. Then he sees Thor's car, and takes from
him a second gold ring; a third he took from Irpa; and then
dragged them all out, and spoiled them of all their gear.</p><br>

<p id="id01749">After that he laid fire to the shrine, and burnt it down, and
then he goes away just as it began to dawn. He walks across a
ploughed field, and there six men sprang up with weapons, and
fall upon him at once; but he made a stout defence, and the end
of the business was that he slays three men, but wounds Thrand to
the death, and drives two to the woods, so that they could bear
no news to the earl. He then went up to Thrand and said, "It is
now in my power to slay thee if I will, but I will not do that;
and now I will set more store by the ties that are between us
than ye have shown to me."</p><br>

<p id="id01750">Now Hrapp means to turn back to the wood, but now he sees that
men have come between him and the wood, so he dares not venture
to turn thither, but lays him down in a thicket, and so lies
there a while.</p><br>

<p id="id01751">Earl Hacon and Gudbrand went that morning early to the shrine and
found it burnt down; but the three gods were outside, stripped of
all their bravery.</p><br>

<p id="id01752">Then Gudbrand began to speak, and said, "Much might is given to
our gods, when here they have walked of themselves out of the
fire!"</p><br>

<p id="id01753">"The gods can have naught to do with it," says the earl; "a man
must have burnt the shrine, and borne the gods out; but the gods
do not avenge everything on the spot. That man who has done this
will no doubt be driven away out of Valhalla, and never come in
thither."</p><br>

<p id="id01754">Just then up ran four of the earl's men, and told them ill
tidings for they said they had found three men slain in the
field, and Thrand wounded to the death.</p><br>

<p id="id01755">"Who can have done this?" says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01756">"Killing-Hrapp," they say.</p><br>

<p id="id01757">"Then he must have burnt down the shrine," says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01758">They said they thought he was like enough to have done it.</p><br>

<p id="id01759">"And where may he be now?" says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01760">They said that Thrand had told them that he had lain down in a
thicket.</p><br>

<p id="id01761">The earl goes thither to look for him, but Hrapp was off and
away. Then the earl set his men to search for him, but still
they could not find him. So the earl was in the hue and cry
himself, but first he bade them rest a while.</p><br>

<p id="id01762">Then the earl went aside by himself, away from other men, and
bade that no man should follow him, and so he stays a while. He
fell down on both his knees, and held his hands before his eyes;
after that he went back to them, and then he said to them, "Come
with me."</p><br>

<p id="id01763">So they went along with him. He turns short away from the path
on which they had walked before, and they came to a dell. There
up sprang Hrapp before them, and there it was that he had hidden
himself at first.</p><br>

<p id="id01764">The earl urges on his men to run after him, but Hrapp was so
swift-footed that they never came near him. Hrapp made for
Hlada. There both Thrain and Njal's sons lay "boun" for sea at
the same time. Hrapp runs to where Njal's sons are.</p><br>

<p id="id01765">"Help me, like good men and true," he said, "for the earl will
slay me."</p><br>

<p id="id01766">Helgi looked at him, and said, "Thou lookest like an unlucky man,
and the man who will not take thee in will have the best of it."</p><br>

<p id="id01767">"Would that the worst might befall you from me," says Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01768">"I am the man," says Helgi, "to avenge me on thee for this as
time rolls on."</p><br>

<p id="id01769">Then Hrapp turned to Thrain Sigfus' son, and bade him shelter
him.</p><br>

<p id="id01770">"What hast thou on thy hand?" says Thrain.</p><br>

<p id="id01771">"I have burnt a shrine under the earl's eyes, and slain some men,
and now he will be here speedily, for he has joined in the hue
and cry himself."</p><br>

<p id="id01772">"It hardly beseems me to do this," says Thrain, "when the earl
has done me so much good."</p><br>

<p id="id01773">Then he shewed Thrain the precious things which he had borne out
of the shrine, and offered to give him the goods, but Thrain said
he could not take them unless he gave him other goods of the same
worth for them.</p><br>

<p id="id01774">"Then," said Hrapp, "here will I take my stand, and here shall
I be slain before thine eyes, and then thou wilt have to abide by
every man's blame."</p><br>

<p id="id01775">Then they see the earl and his band of men coming, and then
Thrain took Hrapp under his safeguard, and let them shove off the
boat, and put out to his ship.</p><br>

<p id="id01776">Then Thrain said, "Now this will be thy best hiding place, to
knock out the bottoms of two casks, and then thou shalt get into
them."</p><br>

<p id="id01777">So it was done, and he got into the casks, and then they were
lashed together, and lowered overboard.</p><br>

<p id="id01778">Then comes the earl with his band to Njal's sons, and asked if<br>

Hrapp had come there.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01779">They said that he had come.</p><br>

<p id="id01780">The earl asked whither he had gone thence?</p><br>

<p id="id01781">They said they had not kept eyes on him, and could not say.</p><br>

<p id="id01782">"He," said the earl, "should have great honour from me who would
tell me where Hrapp was."</p><br>

<p id="id01783">Then Grim said softly to Helgi, "Why should we not say, What know<br>

I whether Thrain will repay us with any good?"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01784">"We should not tell a whit more for that," says Helgi, "when his
life lies at stake."</p><br>

<p id="id01785">"May be," said Grim, "the earl will turn his vengeance on us,
for he is so wroth that some one will have to fall before him."</p><br>

<p id="id01786">"That must not move us," says Helgi, "but still we will pull our
ship out, and so away to sea as soon as ever we get a wind."</p><br>

<p id="id01787">So they rowed out under an isle that lay there, and wait there
for a fair breeze.</p><br>

<p id="id01788">The earl went about among the sailors, and tried them all, but
they, one and all, denied that they knew aught of Hrapp.</p><br>

<p id="id01789">Then the earl said, "Now we will go to Thrain, my brother in
arms, and he will give Hrapp up, if he knows anything of him."</p><br>

<p id="id01790">After that they took a long-ship and went off to the merchant
ship.</p><br>

<p id="id01791">Thrain sees the earl coming, and stands up and greets him kindly.
The earl took his greeting well and spoke thus, ??? "We are
seeking for a man whose name is Hrapp, and he is an Icelander.
He has done us all kind of ill; and now we will ask you to be
good enough to give him up, or to tell us where he is."</p><br>

<p id="id01792">"Ye know, lord," said Thrain, "that I slew your outlaw, and
then put my life in peril, and for that I had of you great
honour."</p><br>

<p id="id01793">"More honour shalt thou now have," says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01794">Now Thrain thought within himself, and could not make up his mind
how the earl would take it, so he denies that Hrapp is here, and
bade the earl to look for him. He spent little time on that, and
went on land alone, away from other men, and was then very wroth,
so that no man dared to speak to him.</p><br>

<p id="id01795">"Shew me to Njal's sons," said the earl, "and I will force them
to tell me the truth."</p><br>

<p id="id01796">Then he was told that they had put out of the harbour.</p><br>

<p id="id01797">"Then there is no help for it," says the earl, "but still there
were two water-casks alongside of Thrain's ship, and in them a
man may well have been hid, and if Thrain has hidden him, there
he must be; and now we will go a second time to see Thrain."</p><br>

<p id="id01798">Thrain sees that the earl means to put off again and said,
"However wroth the earl was last time, now he will be half as
wroth again, and now the life of every man on board the ship lies
at stake."</p><br>

<p id="id01799">They all gave their words to hide the matter, for they were all
sore afraid. Then they took some sacks out of the lading, and
put Hrapp down into the hold in their stead, and other sacks that
were light were laid over him.</p><br>

<p id="id01800">Now comes the earl, just as they were done stowing Hrapp away.
Thrain greeted the earl well. The earl was rather slow to return
it, and they saw that the earl was very wroth.</p><br>

<p id="id01801">Then said the earl to Thrain, "Give thou up Hrapp, for I am quite
sure that thou hast hidden him."</p><br>

<p id="id01802">"Where shall I have hidden him, Lord?" says Thrain.</p><br>

<p id="id01803">"That thou knowest best," says the earl; "but if I must guess,
then I think that thou hiddest him in the water-casks a while
ago."</p><br>

<p id="id01804">"Well!" says Thrain, "I would rather not be taken for a liar, far
sooner would I that ye should search the ship."</p><br>

<p id="id01805">Then the earl went on board the ship and hunted and hunted, but
found him not.</p><br>

<p id="id01806">"Dost thou speak me free now?" says Thrain.</p><br>

<p id="id01807">"Far from it," says the earl, "and yet I cannot tell why we
cannot find him, but methinks I see through it all when I come on
shore, but when I come here, I can see nothing."</p><br>

<p id="id01808">With that he made them row him ashore. He was so wroth that
there was no speaking to him. His son Sweyn was there with him,
and he said, "A strange turn of mind this to let guiltless men
smart for one's wrath!"</p><br>

<p id="id01809">Then the earl went away alone aside from other men, and after
that he went back to them at once, and said, "Let us row out to
them again," and they did so.</p><br>

<p id="id01810">"Where can he have been hidden?" says Sweyn.</p><br>

<p id="id01811">"There's not much good in knowing that," says the earl, "for now
he will be away thence; two sacks lay there by the rest of the
lading, and Hrapp must have come into the lading in their place."</p><br>

<p id="id01812">Then Thrain began to speak, and said, "They are running off the
ship again, and they must mean to pay us another visit. Now we
will take him out of the lading, and stow other things in his
stead, but let the sacks still lie loose." They did so, and then
Thrain spoke: "Now let us fold Hrapp in the sail."</p><br>

<p id="id01813">It was then brailed up to the yard, and they did so.</p><br>

<p id="id01814">Then the earl comes to Thrain and his men, and he was very wroth,
and said, "Wilt thou now give up the man, Thrain?" and he is
worse now than before.</p><br>

<p id="id01815">"I would have given him up long ago," answers Thrain, "if he had
been in my keeping, or where can he have been?"</p><br>

<p id="id01816">"In the lading," says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01817">"Then why did ye not seek him there?" says Thrain.</p><br>

<p id="id01818">"That never came into our mind," says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01819">After that they sought him over all the ship, and found him not.</p><br>

<p id="id01820">"Will you now hold me free?" says Thrain.</p><br>

<p id="id01821">"Surely not," says the earl, "for I know that thou hast hidden
away the man, though I find him not; but I would rather that thou
shouldst be a dastard to me than I to thee," says the earl, and
then they went on shore.</p><br>

<p id="id01822">"Now," says the earl, "I seem to see that Thrain has hidden away<br>

Hrapp in the sail."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01823">Just then, up sprung a fair breeze, and Thrain and his men sailed
out to sea. He then spoke these words which have long been held
in mind since ???</p><br>

<p id="id01824">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us make the Vulture fly,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing now gars Thrain flinch."<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01825">But when the earl heard of Thrain's words, then he said, "'Tis
not my want of foresight which caused this, but rather their
ill-fellowship, which will drag them both to death."</p><br>

<p id="id01826">Thrain was a short time out on the sea, and so came to Iceland,
and fared home to his house. Hrapp went along with Thrain, and
was with him that year; but the spring after, Thrain got him a
homestead at Hrappstede, and he dwelt there; but yet he spent
most of his time at Gritwater. He was thought to spoil
everything there, and some men even said that he was too good
friends with Hallgerda, and that he led her astray, but some
spoke against that.</p><br>

<p id="id01827">Thrain gave the Vulture to his kinsman, Mord the Reckless; that<br>

Mord slew Oddi Haldor's son, east in Gautawick by Berufirth.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01828">All Thrain's kinsmen looked on him as a chief.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01829" style="margin-top: 3em">88. EARL HACON FIGHTS WITH NJAL'S SONS.</h3>

<p id="id01830">Now we must take up the story, and say how, when Earl Hacon
missed Thrain, he spoke to Sweyn his son, and said, "Let us take
four long-ships, and let us fare against Njal's sons and slay
them, for they must have known all about it with Thrain."</p><br>

<p id="id01831">"'Tis not good counsel," says Sweyn, "to throw the blame on
guiltless men, but to let him escape who is guilty."</p><br>

<p id="id01832">"I shall have my way in this," says the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01833">Now they hold on after Njal's sons, and seek for them, and find
them under an island.</p><br>

<p id="id01834">Grim first saw the earl's ships and said to Helgi, "Here are war
ships sailing up, and I see that here is the earl, and he can
mean to offer us no peace."</p><br>

<p id="id01835">"It is said," said Helgi, "that he is the boldest man who holds
his own against all comers, and so we will defend ourselves."</p><br>

<p id="id01836">They all bade him take the course he thought best, and then they
took to their arms.</p><br>

<p id="id01837">Now the earl comes up and called out to them, and bade them give
themselves up.</p><br>

<p id="id01838">Helgi said that they would defend themselves so long as they
could.</p><br>

<p id="id01839">Then the earl offered peace and quarter to all who would neither
defend themselves nor Helgi; but Helgi was so much beloved that
all said they would rather die with him.</p><br>

<p id="id01840">Then the earl and his men fall on them, but they defended
themselves well, and Njal's sons were ever where there was most
need. The earl often offered peace, but they all made the same
answer, and said they would never yield.</p><br>

<p id="id01841">Then Aslak of Longisle pressed them hard and came on board their
ship thrice. Then Grim said, "Thou pressest on hard, and 'twere
well that thou gettest what thou seekest;" and with that he
snatched up a spear and hurled it at him, and hit him under the
chin, and Aslak got his death wound there and then.</p><br>

<p id="id01842">A little after, Helgi slew Egil the earl's banner-bearer.</p><br>

<p id="id01843">Then Sweyn, Earl Hacon's son, fell on them, and made men hem them
in and bear them down with shields, and so they were taken
captive.</p><br>

<p id="id01844">The earl was for letting them all be slain at once, but Sweyn
said that should not be, and said too that it was night.</p><br>

<p id="id01845">Then the earl said, "Well, then, slay them to-morrow, but bind
them fast to-night."</p><br>

<p id="id01846">"So, I ween, it must be," says Sweyn; "but never yet have I met
brisker men than these, and I call it the greatest manscathe to
take their lives."</p><br>

<p id="id01847">"They have slain two of our briskest men," said the earl, "and
for that they shall be slain."</p><br>

<p id="id01848">"Because they were brisker men themselves," says Sweyn; "but
still in this it must be done as thou willest."</p><br>

<p id="id01849">So they were bound and fettered.</p><br>

<p id="id01850">After that the earl fell asleep; but when all men slept, Grim
spoke to Helgi, and said, "Away would I get if I could."</p><br>

<p id="id01851">"Let us try some trick then," says Helgi.</p><br>

<p id="id01852">Grim sees that there lies an axe edge up, so Grim crawled
thither, and gets the bowstring which bound him cut asunder
against the axe, but still he got great wounds on his arms.</p><br>

<p id="id01853">Then he set Helgi loose, and after that they crawled over the
ship's side, and got on shore, so that neither Hacon nor his men
were ware of them. Then they broke off their fetters, and walked
away to the other side of the island. By that time it began to
dawn. There they found a ship, and knew that there was come Kari
Solmund's son. They went at once to meet him, and told him of
their wrongs and hardships, and showed him their wounds, and said
the earl would be then asleep.</p><br>

<p id="id01854">"Ill is it," said Kari, "that ye should suffer such wrongs for
wicked men; but what now would be most to your minds?"</p><br>

<p id="id01855">"To fall on the earl," they say, "and slay him."</p><br>

<p id="id01856">"This will not be fated," says Kari; "but still ye do not lack
heart, but we will first know whether he is there now."</p><br>

<p id="id01857">After that they fared thither, and then the earl was up and away.</p><br>

<p id="id01858">Then Kari sailed in to Hlada to meet the earl, and brought him
the Orkney scatts, so the earl said, "Hast thou taken Njal's sons
into thy keeping?"</p><br>

<p id="id01859">"So it is, sure enough," says Kari.</p><br>

<p id="id01860">"Wilt thou hand Njal's sons over to me?" asks the earl.</p><br>

<p id="id01861">"No, I will not," said Kari.</p><br>

<p id="id01862">"Wilt thou swear this," says the earl, "that thou wilt not fall
on me with Njal's sons?"</p><br>

<p id="id01863">Then Eric, the earl's son, spoke and said, "Such things ought
not to be asked. Kari has always been our friend, and things
should not have gone as they have, had I been by. Njal's sons
should have been set free from all blame, but they should have
had chastisement who had wrought for it. Methinks now it would
be more seemly to give Njal's sons good gifts for the hardships
and wrongs which have been put upon them, and the wounds they
have got."</p><br>

<p id="id01864">"So it ought to be, sure enough," says the earl, "but I know not
whether they will take an atonement."</p><br>

<p id="id01865">Then the earl said that Kari should try the feeling of Njal's
sons as to an atonement.</p><br>

<p id="id01866">After that Kari spoke to Helgi, and asked whether he would take
any amends from the earl or not.</p><br>

<p id="id01867">"I will take them," said Helgi, "from his son Eric, but I will
have nothing to do with the earl."</p><br>

<p id="id01868">Then Kari told Eric their answer.</p><br>

<p id="id01869">"So it shall be." says Eric. "He shall take the amends from me
if he thinks it better; and tell them this too, that I bid them
to my house, and my father shall do them no harm."</p><br>

<p id="id01870">This bidding they took, and went to Eric's house, and were with
him till Kari was ready to sail west across the sea to meet Earl
Sigurd.</p><br>

<p id="id01871">Then Eric made a feast for Kari, and gave him gifts, and Njal's
sons gifts too. After that Kari fared west across the sea, and
met Earl Sigurd, and he greeted them very well, and they were
with the earl that winter.</p><br>

<p id="id01872">But when the spring came, Kari asked Njal's sons to go on warfare
with him, but Grim said they would only do so if he would fare
with them afterwards out to Iceland. Kari gave his word to do
that, and then they fared with him a-searoving. They harried
south about Anglesea and all the Southern isles. Thence they
held on to Cantyre, and landed there, and fought with the
landsmen, and got thence much goods, and so fared to their ships.
Thence they fared south to Wales, and harried there. Then
they held on for Alan, and there they met Godred, and fought with
him, and got the victory, and slew Dungal the king's son. There
they took great spoil. Thence they held on north to Coll, and
found Earl Gilli there, and he greeted them well and there they
stayed with him a while. The earl fared with them to the Orkneys
to meet Earl Sigurd, but next spring Earl Sigurd gave away his
sister Nereida to Earl Gilli, and then he fared back to the
Southern isles.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01873" style="margin-top: 3em">89. NJAL'S SONS AND KARI COME OUT TO ICELAND</h3>

<p id="id01874">That summer Kari and Njal's sons busked them for Iceland, and
when they were "all-boun" they went to see the earl. The earl
gave them good gifts, and they parted with great friendship.</p><br>

<p id="id01875">Now they put to sea and have a short passage, and they got a fine
fair breeze, and made the land at Eyrar. Then they got them
horses and ride from the ship to Bergthorsknoll, but when they
came home all men were glad to see them. They flitted home their
goods and laid up the ship, and Kari was there that winter with
Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01876">But the spring after, Kari asked for Njal's daughter, Helga, to
wife, and Helgi and Grim backed his suit; and so the end of it
was that she was betrothed to Kari and the day for the wedding-
feast was fixed, and the feast was held half a month before
mid-summer, and they were that winter with Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01877">Then Kari bought him land at Dyrholms, east away by Mydale, and
set up a farm there; they put in there a grieve and housekeeper
to see after the farm, but they themselves were ever with Njal.</p><br>

<h3 id="id01878" style="margin-top: 3em">90. THE QUARREL OF NJAL'S SONS WITH THRAIN SIGFUS' SON</h3>

<p id="id01879">Hrapp owned a farm at Hrappstede, but for all that he was always
at Gritwater, and he was thought to spoil everything there.
Thrain was good to him.</p><br>

<p id="id01880">Once on a time it happened that Kettle of the Mark was at
Bergthorsknoll; then Njal's sons told him of their wrongs and
hardships, and said they had much to lay at Thrain Sigfus son's
door, whenever they chose to speak about it.</p><br>

<p id="id01881">Njal said it would be best that Kettle should talk with his
brother Thrain about it, and he gave his word to do so.</p><br>

<p id="id01882">So they gave Kettle breathing-time to talk to Thrain.</p><br>

<p id="id01883">A little after they spoke of the matter again to Kettle, but he
said that he would repeat few of the words that had passed
between them, "For it was pretty plain that Thrain thought I set
too great store on being your brother-in-law."</p><br>

<p id="id01884">Then they dropped talking about it, and thought they saw that
things looked ugly, and so they asked their father for his
counsel as to what was to be done, but they told him they would
not let things rest as they then stood.</p><br>

<p id="id01885">"Such things," said Njal, "are not so strange. It will be
thought that they are slain without a cause, if they are slain
now, and my counsel is, that as many men as may be should be
brought to talk with them about these things, and thus as many as
we can find may be ear-witnesses if they answer ill as to these
things. Then Kari shall talk about them too, for he is just the
man with the right turn of mind for this; then the dislike
between you will grow and grow, for they will heap bad words on
bad words when men bring the matter forward, for they are foolish
men. It may also well be that it may be said that my sons are
slow to take up a quarrel, but ye shall bear that for the sake of
gaining time, for there are two sides to everything that is done,
and ye can always pick a quarrel; but still ye shall let so much
of your purpose out, as to say that if any wrong be put upon you
that ye do mean something. But if ye had taken counsel from me
at first, then these things should never have been spoken about
at all, and then ye would have gotten no disgrace from them; but
now ye have the greatest risk of it, and so it will go on ever
growing and growing with your disgrace, that ye will never get
rid of it until ye bring yourselves into a strait, and have to
fight your way out with weapons; but in that there is a long and
weary night in which ye will have to grope your way."</p><br>

<p id="id01886">After that they ceased speaking about it; but the matter became
the daily talk of many men.</p><br>

<p id="id01887">One day it happened that those brothers spoke to Kari and bade
him go to Gritwater. Kari said he thought he might go
elsewhither on a better journey, but still he would go if that
were Njal's counsel. So after that Kari fares to meet Thrain,
and then they talk over the matter, and they did not each look at
it in the same way.</p><br>

<p id="id01888">Kari comes home, and Njal's sons ask how things had gone between
Thrain and him. Kari said he would rather not repeat the words
that had passed, "But," he went on, "it is to be looked for that
the like words will be spoken when ye yourselves can hear them."</p><br>

<p id="id01889">Thrain had fifteen house-carles trained to arms in his house, and
eight of them rode with him whithersoever he went. Thrain was
very fond of show and dress, and always rode in a blue cloak, and
had on a gilded helm, and the spear ??? the earl's gift ??? in his
hand, and a fair shield, and a sword at his belt. Along with him
always went Gunnar Lambi's son, and Lambi Sigurd's son, and Grani
Gunnar of Lithend's son. But nearest of all to him went Killing-
Hrapp. Lodinn was the name of his serving-man, he too went with
Thrain when he journeyed; Tjorvi was the name of Lodinn's
brother, and he too was one of Thrain's band. The worst of all,
in their words against Njal's sons, were Hrapp and Grani; and it
was mostly their doing that no atonement was offered to them.</p><br>

<p id="id01890">Njal's sons often spoke to Kari that he should ride with them;
and it came to that at last, for he said it would be well that
they heard Thrain's answer.</p><br>

<p id="id01891">Then they busked them, four of Njal's sons, and Kari the fifth,
and so they fare to Gritwater.</p><br>

<p id="id01892">There was a wide porch in the homestead there, so that many men
might stand in it side by side. There was a woman out of doors,
and she saw their coming, and told Thrain of it; he bade them to
go out into the porch, and take their arms, and they did so.</p><br>

<p id="id01893">Thrain stood in mid-door, but Killing-Hrapp and Grani Gunnar's
son stood on either hand of him; then next stood Gunnar Lambi's
son, then Lodinn and Tjorvi, then Lambi Sigurd's son; then each
of the others took his place right and left; for the house-carles
were all at home.</p><br>

<p id="id01894">Skarphedinn and his men walk up from below, and he went first,
then Kari, then Hauskuld, then Grim, then Helgi. But when they
had come up to the door, then not a word of welcome passed the
lips of those who stood before them.</p><br>

<p id="id01895">"May we all be welcome here?" said Skarphedinn.</p><br>

<p id="id01896">Hallgerda stood in the porch, and had been talking low to Hrapp,
then she spoke out loud: "None of those who are here will say
that ye are welcome."</p><br>

<p id="id01897">Then Skarphedinn sang a song:</p><br>

<p id="id01898">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prop of sea-waves' fire (1), thy fretting<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot cast a weight on us,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors wight; yes, wolf and eagle<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willingly I feed to-day;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carline thrust into the ingle,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a tramping whore, art thou;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of skates that skim the sea-belt (2),<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odin's mocking cup (3) I mix"<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01899">"Thy words," said Skarphedinn, "will not be worth much, for thou
art either a hag, only fit to sit in the ingle, or a harlot."</p><br>

<p id="id01900">"These words of thine thou shalt pay for," she says, "ere thou
farest home."</p><br>

<p id="id01901">"Thee am I come to see, Thrain," said Helgi, "and to know if thou
wilt make me any amends for those wrongs and hardships which
befell me for thy sake in Norway."</p><br>

<p id="id01902">"I never knew," said Thrain, "that ye two brothers were wont to
measure your manhood by money; or, how long shall such a claim
for amends stand over?"</p><br>

<p id="id01903">"Many will say," says Helgi, "that thou oughtest to offer us
atonement, since thy life was at stake."</p><br>

<p id="id01904">Then Hrapp said, "'Twas just luck that swayed the balance, when
he got stripes who ought to bear them; and she dragged you under
disgrace and hardships, but us away from them."</p><br>

<p id="id01905">"Little good luck was there in that," says Helgi, "to break faith
with the earl, and to take to thee instead."</p><br>

<p id="id01906">"Thinkest thou not that thou hast some amends to seek from me,"
says Hrapp. "I will atone thee in a way that, methinks, were
fitting."</p><br>

<p id="id01907">"The only dealings we shall have," says Helgi, "will be those
which will not stand thee in good stead."</p><br>

<p id="id01908">"Don't bandy words with Hrapp," said Skarphedinn, "but give him a
red skin for a grey." (4)</p><br>

<p id="id01909">"Hold thy tongue, Skarphedinn," said Hrapp, "or I will not spare
to bring my axe on thy head."</p><br>

<p id="id01910">"'Twill be proved soon enough, I dare say," says Skarphedinn,
"which of us is to scatter gravel over the other's head."</p><br>

<p id="id01911">"Away with you home, ye `Dungbeardlings!'" says Hallgerda, "and
so we will call you always from this day forth; but your father
we will call `the Beardless Carle.'"</p><br>

<p id="id01912">They did not fare home before all who were there had made
themselves guilty of uttering those words, save Thrain; he
forbade men to utter them.</p><br>

<p id="id01913">Then Njal's sons went away, and fared till they came home, then
they told their father.</p><br>

<p id="id01914">"Did ye call any men to witness of those words?" says Njal.</p><br>

<p id="id01915">"We called none," says Skarphedinn; "we do not mean to follow
that suit up except on the battle-field."</p><br>

<p id="id01916">"No one will now think," says Bergthora, "that ye have the heart
to lift your weapons."</p><br>

<p id="id01917">"Spare thy tongue, mistress!" says Kari, "in egging on thy sons,
for they will be quite eager enough."</p><br>

<p id="id01918">After that they all talk long in secret, Njal and his sons, and<br>

Kari Solmund's son, their brother-in-law.<br>
