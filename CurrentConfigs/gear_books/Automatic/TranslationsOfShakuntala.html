 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h4>KALIDASA HIS LIFE AND WRITINGS</h4>
<br>
<p><b>I</b></p><br>
<p>Kalidasa probably lived in the fifth century of the Christian era.
This date, approximate as it is, must yet be given with considerable
hesitation, and is by no means certain. No truly biographical data are
preserved about the author, who nevertheless enjoyed a great
popularity during his life, and whom the Hindus have ever regarded as
the greatest of Sanskrit poets. We are thus confronted with one of the
remarkable problems of literary history. For our ignorance is not due
to neglect of Kalidasa's writings on the part of his countrymen, but
to their strange blindness in regard to the interest and importance of
historic fact. No European nation can compare with India in critical
devotion to its own literature. During a period to be reckoned not by
centuries but by millenniums, there has been in India an unbroken line
of savants unselfishly dedicated to the perpetuation and exegesis of
the native masterpieces. Editions, recensions, commentaries abound;
poets have sought the exact phrase of appreciation for their
predecessors: yet when we seek to reconstruct the life of their
greatest poet, we have no materials except certain tantalising
legends, and such data as we can gather from the writings of a man who
hardly mentions himself.</p><br>
<p>
One of these legends deserves to be recounted for its intrinsic
interest, although it contains, so far as we can see, no grain of
historic truth, and although it places Kalidasa in Benares, five
hundred miles distant from the only city in which we certainly know
that he spent a part of his life. According to this account, Kalidasa
was a Brahman's child. At the age of six months he was left an orphan
and was adopted by an ox-driver. He grew to manhood without formal
education, yet with remarkable beauty and grace of manner. Now it
happened that the Princess of Benares was a blue-stocking, who
rejected one suitor after another, among them her father's counsellor,
because they failed to reach her standard as scholars and poets. The
rejected counsellor planned a cruel revenge. He took the handsome
ox-driver from the street, gave him the garments of a savant and a
retinue of learned doctors, then introduced him to the princess, after
warning him that he was under no circumstances to open his lips. The
princess was struck with his beauty and smitten to the depths of her
pedantic soul by his obstinate silence, which seemed to her, as indeed
it was, an evidence of profound wisdom. She desired to marry Kalidasa,
and together they went to the temple. But no sooner was the ceremony
performed than Kalidasa perceived an image of a bull. His early
training was too much for him; the secret came out, and the bride was
furious. But she relented in response to Kalidasa's entreaties, and
advised him to pray for learning and poetry to the goddess Kali. The
prayer was granted; education and poetical power descended
miraculously to dwell with the young ox-driver, who in gratitude
assumed the name Kalidasa, servant of Kali. Feeling that he owed this
happy change in his very nature to his princess, he swore that he
would ever treat her as his teacher, with profound respect but without
familiarity. This was more than the lady had bargained for; her anger
burst forth anew, and she cursed Kalidasa to meet his death at the
hands of a woman. At a later date, the story continues, this curse was
fulfilled. A certain king had written a half-stanza of verse, and had
offered a large reward to any poet who could worthily complete it.
Kalidasa completed the stanza without difficulty; but a woman whom he
loved discovered his lines, and greedy of the reward herself, killed
him.</p><br>
<p>
Another legend represents Kalidasa as engaging in a pilgrimage to a
shrine of Vishnu in Southern India, in company with two other famous
writers, Bhavabhuti and Dandin. Yet another pictures Bhavabhuti as a
contemporary of Kalidasa, and jealous of the less austere poet's
reputation. These stories must be untrue, for it is certain that the
three authors were not contemporary, yet they show a true instinct in
the belief that genius seeks genius, and is rarely isolated.</p><br>
<p>
This instinctive belief has been at work with the stories which
connect Kalidasa with King Vikramaditya and the literary figures of
his court. It has doubtless enlarged, perhaps partly falsified the
facts; yet we cannot doubt that there is truth in this tradition, late
though it be, and impossible though it may ever be to separate the
actual from the fanciful. Here then we are on firmer ground.</p><br>
<p>
King Vikramaditya ruled in the city of Ujjain, in West-central India.
He was mighty both in war and in peace, winning especial glory by a
decisive victory over the barbarians who pressed into India through
the northern passes. Though it has not proved possible to identify
this monarch with any of the known rulers, there can be no doubt that
he existed and had the character attributed to him. The name
VikramadityaSun of Valouris probably not a proper name, but a
title like Pharaoh or Tsar. No doubt Kalidasa intended to pay a
tribute to his patron, the Sun of Valour, in the very title of his
play, <i>Urvashi won by Valour</i>.</p><br>
<p>
King Vikramaditya was a great patron of learning and of poetry. Ujjain
during his reign was the most brilliant capital in the world, nor has
it to this day lost all the lustre shed upon it by that splendid
court. Among the eminent men gathered there, nine were particularly
distinguished, and these nine are known as the "nine gems." Some of
the nine gems were poets, others represented scienceastronomy,
medicine, lexicography. It is quite true that the details of this late
tradition concerning the nine gems are open to suspicion, yet the
central fact is not doubtful: that there was at this time and place a
great quickening of the human mind, an artistic impulse creating works
that cannot perish. Ujjain in the days of Vikramaditya stands worthily
beside Athens, Rome, Florence, and London in their great centuries.
Here is the substantial fact behind Max M&amp;uuml;ller's often ridiculed
theory of the renaissance of Sanskrit literature. It is quite false to
suppose, as some appear to do, that this theory has been invalidated
by the discovery of certain literary products which antedate
Kalidasa. It might even be said that those rare and happy centuries
that see a man as great as Homer or Vergil or Kalidasa or Shakespeare
partake in that one man of a renaissance.</p><br>
<p>
It is interesting to observe that the centuries of intellectual
darkness in Europe have sometimes coincided with centuries of light in
India. The Vedas were composed for the most part before Homer;
Kalidasa and his contemporaries lived while Rome was tottering under
barbarian assault.</p><br>
<p>
To the scanty and uncertain data of late traditions may be added some
information about Kalidasa's life gathered from his own writings. He
mentions his own name only in the prologues to his three plays, and
here with a modesty that is charming indeed, yet tantalising. One
wishes for a portion of the communicativeness that characterises some
of the Indian poets. He speaks in the first person only once, in the
verses introductory to his epic poem <i>The Dynasty of
Raghu</i>.[1]
Here also we feel his modesty, and here once more we are balked of
details as to his life.</p><br>
<p>
We know from Kalidasa's writings that he spent at least a part of his
life in the city of Ujjain. He refers to Ujjain more than once, and in
a manner hardly possible to one who did not know and love the city.
Especially in his poem <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i> does he dwell upon the
city's charms, and even bids the cloud make a dtour in his long
journey lest he should miss making its
acquaintance.[2]</p><br>
<p>
We learn further that Kalidasa travelled widely in India. The fourth
canto of <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> describes a tour about the whole of
India and even into regions which are beyond the borders of a narrowly
measured India. It is hard to believe that Kalidasa had not himself
made such a "grand tour"; so much of truth there may be in the
tradition which sends him on a pilgrimage to Southern India. The
thirteenth canto of the same epic and <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i> also
describe long journeys over India, for the most part through regions
far from Ujjain. It is the mountains which impress him most deeply.
His works are full of the Himalayas. Apart from his earliest drama
and the slight poem called <i>The Seasons</i>, there is not one of them
which is not fairly redolent of mountains. One, <i>The Birth of the
War-god</i>, might be said to be all mountains. Nor was it only Himalayan
grandeur and sublimity which attracted him; for, as a Hindu critic has
acutely observed, he is the only Sanskrit poet who has described a
certain flower that grows in Kashmir. The sea interested him less. To
him, as to most Hindus, the ocean was a beautiful, terrible barrier,
not a highway to adventure. The "sea-belted earth" of which Kalidasa
speaks means to him the mainland of India.</p><br>
<p>
Another conclusion that may be certainly drawn from Kalidasa's writing
is this, that he was a man of sound and rather extensive education. He
was not indeed a prodigy of learning, like Bhavabhuti in his own
country or Milton in England, yet no man could write as he did without
hard and intelligent study. To begin with, he had a minutely accurate
knowledge of the Sanskrit language, at a time when Sanskrit was to
some extent an artificial tongue. Somewhat too much stress is often
laid upon this point, as if the writers of the classical period in
India were composing in a foreign language. Every writer, especially
every poet, composing in any language, writes in what may be called a
strange idiom; that is, he does not write as he talks. Yet it is true
that the gap between written language and vernacular was wider in
Kalidasa's day than it has often been. The Hindus themselves regard
twelve years' study as requisite for the mastery of the "chief of all
sciences, the science of grammar." That Kalidasa had mastered this
science his works bear abundant witness.</p><br>
<p>
He likewise mastered the works on rhetoric and dramatic
theorysubjects which Hindu savants have treated with great, if
sometimes hair-splitting, ingenuity. The profound and subtle systems
of philosophy were also possessed by Kalidasa, and he had some
knowledge of astronomy and law.</p><br>
<p>
But it was not only in written books that Kalidasa was deeply read.
Rarely has a man walked our earth who observed the phenomena of living
nature as accurately as he, though his accuracy was of course that of
the poet, not that of the scientist. Much is lost to us who grow up
among other animals and plants; yet we can appreciate his "bee-black
hair," his ashoka-tree that "sheds his blossoms in a rain of tears,"
his river wearing a sombre veil of mist:</p><br>

<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">Although her reeds seem hands that clutch the dress<br></span>
<span class="i2">To hide her charms;<br></span> </p><br>

</blockquote>
<p>
his picture of the day-blooming water-lily at sunset:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">The water-lily closes, but<br></span>
<span class="i4">With wonderful reluctancy;<br></span>
<span class="i2">As if it troubled her to shut<br></span>
<span class="i4">Her door of welcome to the bee.<br></span> </p><br>

</blockquote>

<p>
The religion of any great poet is always a matter of interest,
especially the religion of a Hindu poet; for the Hindus have ever been
a deeply and creatively religious people. So far as we can judge,
Kalidasa moved among the jarring sects with sympathy for all,
fanaticism for none. The dedicatory prayers that introduce his dramas
are addressed to Shiva. This is hardly more than a convention, for
Shiva is the patron of literature. If one of his epics, <i>The Birth of
the War-god</i>, is distinctively Shivaistic, the other, <i>The Dynasty of
Raghu</i>, is no less Vishnuite in tendency. If the hymn to Vishnu in
<i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> is an expression of Vedantic monism, the hymn
to Brahma in <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> gives equally clear expression
to the rival dualism of the Sankhya system. Nor are the Yoga doctrine
and Buddhism left without sympathetic mention. We are therefore
justified in concluding that Kalidasa was, in matters of religion,
what William James would call "healthy-minded," emphatically not a
"sick soul."</p><br>
<p>
There are certain other impressions of Kalidasa's life and personality
which gradually become convictions in the mind of one who reads and
re-reads his poetry, though they are less easily susceptible of exact
proof. One feels certain that he was physically handsome, and the
handsome Hindu is a wonderfully fine type of manhood. One knows that
he possessed a fascination for women, as they in turn fascinated him.
One knows that children loved him. One becomes convinced that he never
suffered any morbid, soul-shaking experience such as besetting
religious doubt brings with it, or the pangs of despised love; that
on the contrary he moved among men and women with a serene and godlike
tread, neither self-indulgent nor ascetic, with mind and senses ever
alert to every form of beauty. We know that his poetry was popular
while he lived, and we cannot doubt that his personality was equally
attractive, though it is probable that no contemporary knew the full
measure of his greatness. For his nature was one of singular balance,
equally at home in a splendid court and on a lonely mountain, with men
of high and of low degree. Such men are never fully appreciated during
life. They continue to grow after they are dead.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>II</b></p><br>
<p>
Kalidasa left seven works which have come down to us: three dramas,
two epics, one elegiac poem, and one descriptive poem. Many other
works, including even an astronomical treatise, have been attributed
to him; they are certainly not his. Perhaps there was more than one
author who bore the name Kalidasa; perhaps certain later writers were
more concerned for their work than for personal fame. On the other
hand, there is no reason to doubt that the seven recognised works are
in truth from Kalidasa's hand. The only one concerning which there is
reasonable room for suspicion is the short poem descriptive of the
seasons, and this is fortunately the least important of the seven. Nor
is there evidence to show that any considerable poem has been lost,
unless it be true that the concluding cantos of one of the epics have
perished. We are thus in a fortunate position in reading Kalidasa: we
have substantially all that he wrote, and run no risk of ascribing to
him any considerable work from another hand.</p><br>
<p>
Of these seven works, four are poetry throughout; the three dramas,
like all Sanskrit dramas, are written in prose, with a generous
mingling of lyric and descriptive stanzas. The poetry, even in the
epics, is stanzaic; no part of it can fairly be compared to English
blank verse. Classical Sanskrit verse, so far as structure is
concerned, has much in common with familiar Greek and Latin forms:
it makes no systematic use of rhyme; it depends for its rhythm not
upon accent, but upon quantity. The natural medium of translation into
English seems to me to be the rhymed stanza;[3] in the present work
the rhymed stanza has been used, with a consistency perhaps too rigid,
wherever the original is in verse.</p><br>

<p>
Kalidasa's three dramas bear the names: <i>Malavika and Agnimitra,
Urvashi</i>, and <i>Shakuntala</i>. The two epics are <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>
and <i>The Birth of the War-god</i>. The elegiac poem is called <i>The
Cloud-Messenger</i>, and the descriptive poem is entitled <i>The Seasons</i>.
It may be well to state briefly the more salient features of the
Sanskrit <i>genres</i> to which these works belong.</p><br>
<p>
The drama proved in India, as in other countries, a congenial form to
many of the most eminent poets. The Indian drama has a marked
individuality, but stands nearer to the modern European theatre than
to that of ancient Greece; for the plays, with a very few exceptions,
have no religious significance, and deal with love between man and
woman. Although tragic elements may be present, a tragic ending is
forbidden. Indeed, nothing regarded as disagreeable, such as fighting
or even kissing, is permitted on the stage; here Europe may perhaps
learn a lesson in taste. Stage properties were few and simple, while
particular care was lavished on the music. The female parts were
played by women. The plays very rarely have long monologues, even the
inevitable prologue being divided between two speakers, but a Hindu
audience was tolerant of lyrical digression.</p><br>
<p>
It may be said, though the statement needs qualification in both
directions, that the Indian dramas have less action and less
individuality in the characters, but more poetical charm than the
dramas of modern Europe.</p><br>
<p>
On the whole, Kalidasa was remarkably faithful to the ingenious but
somewhat over-elaborate conventions of Indian dramaturgy. His first
play, the <i>Malavika and Agnimitra</i>, is entirely conventional in plot.
The <i>Shakuntala</i> is transfigured by the character of the heroine. The
<i>Urvashi</i>, in spite of detail beauty, marks a distinct decline.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> and <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> belong to a
species of composition which it is not easy to name accurately. The
Hindu name <i>kavya</i> has been rendered by artificial epic, <i>pope
savante, Kunstgedicht</i>. It is best perhaps to use the term epic, and
to qualify the term by explanation.</p><br>
<p>
The <i>kavyas</i> differ widely from the <i>Mahabharata</i> and the <i>Ramayana</i>,
epics which resemble the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> less in outward form
than in their character as truly national poems. The <i>kavya</i> is a
narrative poem written in a sophisticated age by a learned poet, who
possesses all the resources of an elaborate rhetoric and metric. The
subject is drawn from time-honoured mythology. The poem is divided
into cantos, written not in blank verse but in stanzas. Several
stanza-forms are commonly employed in the same poem, though not in the
same canto, except that the concluding verses of a canto are not
infrequently written in a metre of more compass than the remainder.</p><br>
<p>
I have called <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i> an elegiac poem, though it would
not perhaps meet the test of a rigid definition. The Hindus class it
with <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> and <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> as a
<i>kavya</i>, but this classification simply evidences their embarrassment.
In fact, Kalidasa created in <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i> a new <i>genre</i>. No
further explanation is needed here, as the entire poem is translated
below.</p><br>
<p>
The short descriptive poem called <i>The Seasons</i> has abundant analogues
in other literatures, and requires no comment.</p><br>
<p>
It is not possible to fix the chronology of Kalidasa's writings, yet
we are not wholly in the dark. <i>Malavika and Agnimitra</i> was certainly
his first drama, almost certainly his first work. It is a reasonable
conjecture, though nothing more, that Urvashi was written late, when
the poet's powers were waning. The introductory stanzas of <i>The
Dynasty of Raghu</i> suggest that this epic was written before <i>The Birth
of the War-god</i>, though the inference is far from certain. Again, it
is reasonable to assume that the great works on which Kalidasa's fame
chiefly rests<i>Shakuntala</i>, <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i>, <i>The Dynasty of
Raghu</i>, the first eight cantos of <i>The Birth of the War-god</i>were
composed when he was in the prime of manhood. But as to the succession
of these four works we can do little but guess.</p><br>
<p>
Kalidasa's glory depends primarily upon the quality of his work, yet
would be much diminished if he had failed in bulk and variety. In
India, more than would be the case in Europe, the extent of his
writing is an indication of originality and power; for the poets of
the classical period underwent an education that encouraged an
exaggerated fastidiousness, and they wrote for a public meticulously
critical. Thus the great Bhavabhuti spent his life in constructing
three dramas; mighty spirit though he was, he yet suffers from the
very scrupulosity of his labour. In this matter, as in others,
Kalidasa preserves his intellectual balance and his spiritual
initiative: what greatness of soul is required for this, every one
knows who has ever had the misfortune to differ in opinion from an
intellectual clique.</p><br>
<br>

<p>
Le nom de Klidsa domine la posie indienne et la rsume brillamment.
Le drame, l'pope savante, l'lgie attestent aujourd'hui encore la
puissance et la souplesse de ce magnifique gnie; seul entre les
disciples de Sarasvat [the goddess of eloquence], il a eu le bonheur
de produire un chef-d'uvre vraiment classique, o l'Inde s'admire et
o l'humanit se reconnat. Les applaudissements qui salurent la

d'un bout du monde l'autre, quand William Jones l'eut rvle 
l'Occident. Klidsa a marqu sa place dans cette pliade tincelante
o chaque nom rsume une priode de l'esprit humain. La srie de ces
noms forme l'histoire, ou plutt elle est l'histoire mme.[4]</p><br>

<p>
It is hardly possible to say anything true about Kalidasa's
achievement which is not already contained in this appreciation. Yet
one loves to expand the praise, even though realising that the critic
is by his very nature a fool. Here there shall at any rate be none
of that cold-blooded criticism which imagines itself set above a
world-author to appraise and judge, but a generous tribute of
affectionate admiration.</p><br>
<p>
The best proof of a poet's greatness is the inability of men to live
without him; in other words, his power to win and hold through
centuries the love and admiration of his own people, especially when
that people has shown itself capable of high intellectual and
spiritual achievement.</p><br>
<p>
For something like fifteen hundred years, Kalidasa has been more
widely read in India than any other author who wrote in Sanskrit.
There have also been many attempts to express in words the secret of
his abiding power: such attempts can never be wholly successful, yet
they are not without considerable interest. Thus Bana, a celebrated
novelist of the seventh century, has the following lines in some
stanzas of poetical criticism which he prefixes to a historical
romance:</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">

<p>
<span class="i2">Where find a soul that does not thrill<br></span>
<span class="i4">In Kalidasa's verse to meet<br></span>
<span class="i2">The smooth, inevitable lines<br></span>
<span class="i4">Like blossom-clusters, honey-sweet<br></span> </p><br>

</blockquote>
<p>
A later writer, speaking of Kalidasa and another poet, is more laconic
in this alliterative line: <i>Bhaso hasah, Kalidaso vilasah</i>Bhasa is
mirth, Kalidasa is grace.</p><br>
<p>
These two critics see Kalidasa's grace, his sweetness, his delicate
taste, without doing justice to the massive quality without which his
poetry could not have survived.</p><br>
<p>
Though Kalidasa has not been as widely appreciated in Europe as he
deserves, he is the only Sanskrit poet who can properly be said to
have been appreciated at all. Here he must struggle with the truly
Himalayan barrier of language. Since there will never be many
Europeans, even among the cultivated, who will find it possible to
study the intricate Sanskrit language, there remains only one means of
presentation. None knows the cruel inadequacy of poetical translation
like the translator. He understands better than others can, the
significance of the position which Kalidasa has won in Europe. When
Sir William Jones first translated the <i>Shakuntala</i> in 1789, his work
was enthusiastically received in Europe, and most warmly, as was
fitting, by the greatest living poet of Europe. Since that day, as
is testified by new translations and by reprints of the old, there
have been many thousands who have read at least one of Kalidasa's
works; other thousands have seen it on the stage in Europe and
America.</p><br>
<p>
How explain a reputation that maintains itself indefinitely and that
conquers a new continent after a lapse of thirteen hundred years None
can explain it, yet certain contributory causes can be named.</p><br>
<p>
No other poet in any land has sung of happy love between man and woman
as Kalidasa sang. Every one of his works is a love-poem, however much
more it may be. Yet the theme is so infinitely varied that the reader
never wearies. If one were to doubt from a study of European
literature, comparing the ancient classics with modern works, whether
romantic love be the expression of a natural instinct, be not rather a
morbid survival of decaying chivalry, he has only to turn to India's
independently growing literature to find the question settled.
Kalidasa's love-poetry rings as true in our ears as it did in his
countrymen's ears fifteen hundred years ago.</p><br>
<p>
It is of love eventually happy, though often struggling for a time
against external obstacles, that Kalidasa writes. There is nowhere in
his works a trace of that not quite healthy feeling that sometimes
assumes the name "modern love." If it were not so, his poetry could
hardly have survived; for happy love, blessed with children, is surely
the more fundamental thing. In his drama <i>Urvashi</i> he is ready to
change and greatly injure a tragic story, given him by long tradition,
in order that a loving pair may not be permanently separated. One
apparent exception there isthe story of Rama and Sita in <i>The
Dynasty of Raghu</i>. In this case it must be remembered that Rama is an
incarnation of Vishnu, and the story of a mighty god incarnate is not
to be lightly tampered with.</p><br>
<p>
It is perhaps an inevitable consequence of Kalidasa's subject that his
women appeal more strongly to a modern reader than his men. The man is
the more variable phenomenon, and though manly virtues are the same in
all countries and centuries, the emphasis has been variously laid. But
the true woman seems timeless, universal. I know of no poet, unless it
be Shakespeare, who has given the world a group of heroines so
individual yet so universal; heroines as true, as tender, as brave as
are Indumati, Sita, Parvati, the Yaksha's bride, and Shakuntala.</p><br>
<p>
Kalidasa could not understand women without understanding children. It
would be difficult to find anywhere lovelier pictures of childhood
than those in which our poet presents the little Bharata, Ayus, Raghu,
Kumara. It is a fact worth noticing that Kalidasa's children are all
boys. Beautiful as his women are, he never does more than glance at a
little girl.</p><br>
<p>
Another pervading note of Kalidasa's writing is his love of external
nature. No doubt it is easier for a Hindu, with his almost instinctive
belief in reincarnation, to feel that all life, from plant to god, is
truly one; yet none, even among the Hindus, has expressed this feeling
with such convincing beauty as has Kalidasa. It is hardly true to say
that he personifies rivers and mountains and trees; to him they have a
conscious individuality as truly and as certainly as animals or men or
gods. Fully to appreciate Kalidasa's poetry one must have spent some
weeks at least among wild mountains and forests untouched by man;
there the conviction grows that trees and flowers are indeed
individuals, fully conscious of a personal life and happy in that
life. The return to urban surroundings makes the vision fade; yet the
memory remains, like a great love or a glimpse of mystic insight, as
an intuitive conviction of a higher truth.</p><br>
<p>
Kalidasa's knowledge of nature is not only sympathetic, it is also
minutely accurate. Not only are the snows and windy music of the
Himalayas, the mighty current of the sacred Ganges, his possession;
his too are smaller streams and trees and every littlest flower. It is
delightful to imagine a meeting between Kalidasa and Darwin. They
would have understood each other perfectly; for in each the same kind
of imagination worked with the same wealth of observed fact.</p><br>
<p>
I have already hinted at the wonderful balance in Kalidasa's
character, by virtue of which he found himself equally at home in a
palace and in a wilderness. I know not with whom to compare him in
this; even Shakespeare, for all his magical insight into natural
beauty, is primarily a poet of the human heart. That can hardly be
said of Kalidasa, nor can it be said that he is primarily a poet of
natural beauty. The two characters unite in him, it might almost be
said, chemically. The matter which I am clumsily endeavouring to make
plain is beautifully epitomised in <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i>. The former
half is a description of external nature, yet interwoven with human
feeling; the latter half is a picture of a human heart, yet the
picture is framed in natural beauty. So exquisitely is the thing done
that none can say which half is superior. Of those who read this
perfect poem in the original text, some are more moved by the one,
some by the other. Kalidasa understood in the fifth century what
Europe did not learn until the nineteenth, and even now comprehends
only imperfectly: that the world was not made for man, that man
reaches his full stature only as he realises the dignity and worth of
life that is not human.</p><br>
<p>
That Kalidasa seized this truth is a magnificent tribute to his
intellectual power, a quality quite as necessary to great poetry as
perfection of form. Poetical fluency is not rare; intellectual grasp
is not very uncommon: but the combination has not been found perhaps
more than a dozen times since the world began. Because he possessed
this harmonious combination, Kalidasa ranks not with Anacreon and
Horace and Shelley, but with Sophocles, Vergil, Milton.</p><br>
<p>
He would doubtless have been somewhat bewildered by Wordsworth's
gospel of nature. "The world is too much with us," we can fancy him
repeating. "How can the world, the beautiful human world, be too much
with us How can sympathy with one form of life do other than vivify
our sympathy with other forms of life"</p><br>
<p>
It remains to say what can be said in a foreign language of Kalidasa's
style. We have seen that he had a formal and systematic education; in
this respect he is rather to be compared with Milton and Tennyson than
with Shakespeare or Burns. He was completely master of his learning.
In an age and a country which reprobated carelessness but were
tolerant of pedantry, he held the scales with a wonderfully even hand,
never heedless and never indulging in the elaborate trifling with
Sanskrit diction which repels the reader from much of Indian
literature. It is true that some western critics have spoken of his
disfiguring conceits and puerile plays on words. One can only wonder
whether these critics have ever read Elizabethan literature; for
Kalidasa's style is far less obnoxious to such condemnation than
Shakespeare's. That he had a rich and glowing imagination, "excelling
in metaphor," as the Hindus themselves affirm, is indeed true; that he
may, both in youth and age, have written lines which would not have
passed his scrutiny in the vigour of manhood, it is not worth while to
deny: yet the total effect left by his poetry is one of extraordinary
sureness and delicacy of taste. This is scarcely a matter for
argument; a reader can do no more than state his own subjective
impression, though he is glad to find that impression confirmed by the
unanimous authority of fifty generations of Hindus, surely the most
competent judges on such a point.</p><br>
<p>
Analysis of Kalidasa's writings might easily be continued, but
analysis can never explain life. The only real criticism is
subjective. We know that Kalidasa is a very great poet, because the
world has not been able to leave him alone.</p><br>

arrow in hand; and a charioteer</i>.)</p><br>
<p>

<blockquote class="poem">

<p>
<span class="i2">I see you hunt the spotted deer<br></span>

<p><i>King</i>. Charioteer, the deer has led us a long chase. And even now</p><br>

<p>
(<i>In surprise</i>.) Pursue as I may, I can hardly keep him in sight.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Charioteer</i>. Your Majesty, I have been holding the horses back
because the ground was rough. This checked us and gave the deer a
lead. Now we are on level ground, and you will easily overtake him.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Then let the reins hang loose.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Charioteer</i>. Yes, your Majesty. (<i>He counterfeits rapid motion</i>.)
Look, your Majesty!</p><br>

<p>
<i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. O King, this deer belongs to the
hermitage, and must not be killed.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Charioteer</i> (<i>listening and looking</i>). Your Majesty, here are two
hermits, come to save the deer at the moment when your arrow was about
to fall.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Stop the chariot.</p><br>
<p>

<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>bowing low</i>). It is done. (<i>He does so</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Hermit</i> (<i>joyfully</i>). A deed worthy of you, scion of Puru's race, and
shining example of kings. May you beget a son to rule earth and
heaven.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>bowing low</i>). I am thankful for a Brahman's blessing.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two hermits</i>. O King, we are on our way to gather firewood. Here,
along the bank of the Malini, you may see the hermitage of Father
Kanva, over which Shakuntala presides, so to speak, as guardian deity.
Unless other deities prevent, pray enter here and receive a welcome.

<p>
<i>The two hermits</i>. No, he has left his daughter to welcome guests, and
has just gone to Somatirtha, to avert an evil fate that threatens her.</p><br>
<p>

it to the sage.</p><br>

<p>

here while I dismount.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Charioteer</i>. I am holding the reins. Dismount, your Majesty.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>dismounts and looks at himself</i>). One should wear modest
garments on entering a hermitage. Take these jewels and the bow. (<i>He
gives them to the charioteer</i>.) Before I return from my visit to the
hermits, have the horses' backs wet down.</p><br>
<p>

<p>
I will draw back into the shade and wait for them. (<i>He stands, gazing
toward them. Enter</i> SHAKUNTALA, <i>as described, and her two friends</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>First friend</i>. It seems to me, dear, that Father Kanva cares more for
the hermitage trees than he does for you. You are delicate as a
jasmine blossom, yet he tells you to fill the trenches about the
trees.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. Oh, it isn't Father's bidding so much. I feel like a
real sister to them. (<i>She waters the trees</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Shakuntala, we have watered the trees that blossom in
the summer-time. Now let's sprinkle those whose flowering-time is
past. That will be a better deed, because we shall not be working for
a reward.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. What a pretty idea! (<i>She does so</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). And this is Kanva's daughter, Shakuntala. (<i>In
surprise</i>.) The good Father does wrong to make her wear the hermit's
dress of bark.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">The sage who yokes her artless charm<br></span>
<span class="i4">With pious pain and grief,<br></span>

<span class="i4">With a soft, blue lotus-leaf.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well, I will step behind a tree and see how she acts with her
friends. (<i>He conceals himself</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. Oh, Anusuya! Priyamvada has fastened this bark dress so
tight that it hurts. Please loosen it. (ANUSUYA <i>does so</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>laughing</i>). You had better blame your own budding
charms for that.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. She is quite right.</p><br>

<p>

<p>

Light of the Grove. She has chosen the mango-tree as her husband.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>approaches and looks at it, joyfully</i>). What a pretty
pair they make. The jasmine shows her youth in her fresh flowers, and
the mango-tree shows his strength in his ripening fruit. (<i>She stands

<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Anusuya, do you know why Shakuntala looks so
hard at the Light of the Grove</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. No. Why</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. She is thinking how the Light of the Grove has found a
good tree, and hoping that she will meet a fine lover.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. That's what you want for yourself. (<i>She tips her
watering-pot</i>.)</p><br>
<p>

Kanva tended with his own handsjust as he did you. You are
forgetting her.</p><br>
<p>

something pleasant to tell you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. What is it, dear</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. It is out of season, but the spring-creeper is covered
with buds down to the very root.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i> (<i>running up</i>). Really</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. Of course. Can't you see</p><br>
<p>

to tell <i>you</i>. You are to be married soon.</p><br>
<p>

yourself.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. I'm not teasing. I really heard Father Kanva say that
this flowering vine was to be a symbol of your coming happiness.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Priyamvada, that is why Shakuntala waters the
spring-creeper so lovingly.</p><br>

(<i>The girls are a little flurried on seeing the king</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. It is nothing very dreadful, sir. But our friend
(<i>indicating</i> SHAKUNTALA) was teased and frightened by a bee.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>to</i> SHAKUNTALA). I hope these pious days are happy ones.
(SHAKUNTALA's <i>eyes drop in embarrassment</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Yes, now that we receive such a distinguished guest.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Welcome, sir. Go to the cottage, Shakuntala, and bring
fruit. This water will do to wash the feet.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Your courteous words are enough to make me feel at home.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Then, sir, pray sit down and rest on this shady bench.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. You, too, are surely wearied by your pious task. Pray be
seated a moment.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>aside to</i> SHAKUNTALA). My dear, we must be polite to
our guest. Shall we sit down (<i>The three girls sit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Oh, why do I have such feelings when I
see this man They seem wrong in a hermitage.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>looking at the girls</i>). It is delightful to see your
friendship. For you are all young and beautiful.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>aside to</i> ANUSUYA). Who is he, dear With his mystery,
and his dignity, and his courtesy He acts like a king and a
gentleman.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. I am curious too. I am going to ask him. (<i>Aloud</i>.) Sir,
you are so very courteous that I make bold to ask you something. What
royal family do you adorn, sir What country is grieving at your
absence Why does a gentleman so delicately bred submit to the weary
journey into our pious grove</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>aside</i>). Be brave, my heart. Anusuya speaks your very
thoughts.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>aside</i>). Shall I tell at once who I am, or conceal it (<i>He
reflects</i>.) This will do. (<i>Aloud</i>.) I am a student of Scripture. It
is my duty to see justice done in the cities of the king. And I have
come to this hermitage on a tour of inspection.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Then we of the hermitage have some one to take care of us.
(SHAKUNTALA <i>shows embarrassment</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i> (<i>observing the demeanour of the pair. Aside to</i>
SHAKUNTALA). Oh, Shakuntala! If only Father were here to-day.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. What would he do</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i>. He would make our distinguished guest happy, if it
took his most precious treasure.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>feigning anger</i>). Go away! You mean something. I'll not
listen to you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. I too would like to ask a question about your friend.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i>. Sir, your request is a favour to us.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Father Kanva lives a lifelong hermit. Yet you say that your
friend is his daughter. How can that be</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Listen, sir. There is a majestic royal sage named
Kaushika</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Ah, yes. The famous Kaushika.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Know, then, that he is the source of our friend's being.
But Father Kanva is her real father, because he took care of her when
she was abandoned.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. You waken my curiosity with the word "abandoned." May I hear
the whole story</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Listen, sir. Many years ago, that royal sage was leading a
life of stern austerities, and the gods, becoming strangely jealous,
sent the nymph Menaka to disturb his devotions.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Yes, the gods feel this jealousy toward the austerities of
others. And then</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Then in the lovely spring-time he saw her intoxicating
beauty(<i>She stops in embarrassment</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. The rest is plain. Surely, she is the daughter of the nymph.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Yes.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. It is as it should be.</p><br>

another question.</p><br>

(SHAKUNTALA <i>starts to walk away without answering</i>.)</p><br>

you have paid your debt. (<i>She forces her to come back</i>.)</p><br>

I therefore remit her debt. (<i>He gives the two friends a ring. They

<br>
<b>THE SECRET</b>
<br>
<p>
(<i>Enter the clown</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i> (<i>sighing</i>). Damn! Damn! Damn! I'm tired of being friends with
this sporting king. "There's a deer!" he shouts, "There's a boar!" And
off he chases on a summer noon through woods where shade is few and
far between. We drink hot, stinking water from the mountain streams,
flavoured with leavesnasty! At odd times we get a little tepid meat
to eat. And the horses and the elephants make such a noise that I
can't even be comfortable at night. Then the hunters and the
bird-chasersdamn 'emwake me up bright and early. They do make an
ear-splitting rumpus when they start for the woods. But even that
isn't the whole misery. There's a new pimple growing on the old boil.
He left us behind and went hunting a deer. And there in a hermitage
they say he foundoh, dear! oh, dear! he found a hermit-girl named
Shakuntala. Since then he hasn't a thought of going back to town. I
lay awake all night, thinking about it. What can I do Well, I'll see
my friend when he is dressed and beautified. (<i>He walks and looks
about</i>.) Hello! Here he comes, with his bow in his hand, and his girl
in his heart. He is wearing a wreath of wild flowers! I'll pretend to
be all knocked up. Perhaps I can get a rest that way. (<i>He stands,
leaning on his staff. Enter the king, as described</i>.)</p><br>

the fibrous lotus-leaves (<i>He listens</i>.) What do you say That
Shakuntala has become seriously ill from the heat, and that these
things are to relieve her suffering Give her the best of care,

me. Where shall I go now to rest from my weariness (<i>He sighs</i>.)
There is no rest for me except in seeing her whom I love. (<i>He looks
up</i>.) She usually spends these hours of midday heat with her friends
on the vine-wreathed banks of the Malini. I will go there. (<i>He walks

And I will hide it in a bunch of flowers and see that it gets into the
king's hand as if it were a relic of the sacrifice.</p><br>
<p>

Shakuntala say</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. I suppose I must obey orders.</p><br>
<p>

yourself in it.</p><br>

<br>
<b>SHAKUNTALA'S DEPARTURE</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE I</b>
<p>
(<i>Enter the two friends, gathering flowers</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Priyamvada, dear Shakuntala has been properly married by
the voluntary ceremony and she has a husband worthy of her. And yet I
am not quite satisfied.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Why not</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. The sacrifice is over and the good king was dismissed
to-day by the hermits. He has gone back to the city and there he is
surrounded by hundreds of court ladies. I wonder whether he will
remember poor Shakuntala or not.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. You need not be anxious about that. Such handsome men
are sure to be good. But there is something else to think about. I
don't know what Father will have to say when he comes back from his
pilgrimage and hears about it.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. I believe that he will be pleased.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Why</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Why not You know he wanted to give his daughter to a lover
worthy of her. If fate brings this about of itself, why shouldn't
Father be happy</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. I suppose you are right. (<i>She looks at her
flower-basket</i>.) My dear, we have gathered flowers enough for the
sacrifice.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. But we must make an offering to the gods that watch over
Shakuntala's marriage. We had better gather more.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Very well. (<i>They do so</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. Who will bid me welcome</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i> (<i>listening</i>). My dear, it sounds like a guest announcing
himself.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Well, Shakuntala is near the cottage. (<i>Reflecting</i>.)
Ah, but to-day her heart is far away. Come, we must do with the

<p>
(<i>The two girls listen and show dejection</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Oh, dear! The very thing has happened. The dear,
absent-minded girl has offended some worthy man.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i> (<i>looking ahead</i>). My dear, this is no ordinary somebody. It
is the great sage Durvasas, the irascible. See how he strides away!</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Nothing burns like fire. Run, fall at his feet, bring
him back, while I am getting water to wash his feet.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. I will. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>stumbling</i>). There! I stumbled in my excitement, and
the flower-basket fell out of my hand. (<i>She collects the scattered
flowers</i>. ANUSUYA <i>returns</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. My dear, he is anger incarnate. Who could appease him But
I softened him a little.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Even that is a good deal for him. Tell me about it.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. When he would not turn back, I fell at his feet and prayed
to him. "Holy sir," I said, "remember her former devotion and pardon
this offence. Your daughter did not recognise your great and holy
power to-day."</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. And then</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Then he said: "My words must be fulfilled. But the curse
shall be lifted when her lover sees a gem which he has given her for a
token." And so he vanished.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. We can breathe again. When the good king went away, he
put a ring, engraved with his own name, on Shakuntala's finger to
remember him by. That will save her.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Come, we must finish the sacrifice for her. (<i>They walk
about</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>gazing</i>). Just look, Anusuya! There is the dear girl,
with her cheek resting on her left hand. She looks like a painted
picture. She is thinking about him. How could she notice a guest when
she has forgotten herself</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Priyamvada, we two must keep this thing to ourselves. We
must be careful of the dear girl. You know how delicate she is.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Would any one sprinkle a jasmine-vine with scalding
water (<i>Exeunt ambo</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
SCENE II.<i>Early Morning</i></p><br>
<p>
(<i>Enter a pupil of</i> KANVA, <i>just risen from sleep</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Pupil</i>. Father Kanva has returned from his pilgrimage, and has bidden
me find out what time it is. I will go into the open air and see how
much of the night remains. (<i>He walks and looks about</i>.) See! The dawn
is breaking. For already</p><br>

<p>
And again:</p><br>

<p>
And again:</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">

<span class="i2">On jujube-trees the blushing dewdrops falter;<br></span>

</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i> (<i>entering hurriedly. To herself</i>). That is just what
happens to the innocent. Shakuntala has been treated shamefully by the
king. <i>Pupil</i>. I will tell Father Kanva that the hour of morning
sacrifice is come. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. The dawn is breaking. I am awake bright and early. But what
shall I do now that I am awake My hands refuse to attend to the
ordinary morning tasks. Well, let love take its course. For the dear,
pure-minded girl trusted himthe traitor! Perhaps it is not the good
king's fault. It must be the curse of Durvasas. Otherwise, how could
the good king say such beautiful things, and then let all this time
pass without even sending a message (<i>She reflects</i>.) Yes, we must
send him the ring he left as a token. But whom shall we ask to take
it The hermits are unsympathetic because they have never suffered. It
seemed as if her friends were to blame and so, try as we might, we
could not tell Father Kanva that Shakuntala was married to Dushyanta
and was expecting a baby. Oh, what shall we do (<i>Enter</i> PRIYAMVADA.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Hurry, Anusuya, hurry! We are getting Shakuntala ready
for her journey.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i> (<i>astonished</i>). What do you mean, my dear</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamuada</i>. Listen. I just went to Shakuntala, to ask if she had
slept well.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. And then</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. I found her hiding her face for shame, and Father Kanva
was embracing her and encouraging her. "My child," he said, "I bring
you joy. The offering fell straight in the sacred fire, and auspicious
smoke rose toward the sacrificer. My pains for you have proved like
instruction given to a good student; they have brought me no regret.
This very day I shall give you an escort of hermits and send you to
your husband."</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. But, my dear, who told Father Kanva about it</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. A voice from heaven that recited a verse when he had
entered the fire-sanctuary.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i> (<i>astonished</i>). What did it say</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. Listen. (<i>Speaking in good Sanskrit</i>.)</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">Know, Brahman, that your child,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Like the fire-pregnant tree,<br></span>

<span class="i2">For earth's prosperity.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
 <i>Anusuya</i> (<i>hugging</i> PRIYAMVADA). I am so glad, dear. But my joy is
half sorrow when I think that Shakuntala is going to be taken away
this very day.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. We must hide our sorrow as best we can. The poor girl
must be made happy to-day.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Well, here is a cocoa-nut casket, hanging on a branch of
the mango-tree. I put flower-pollen in it for this very purpose. It
keeps fresh, you know. Now you wrap it in a lotus-leaf, and I will get
yellow pigment and earth from a sacred spot and blades of panic grass
for the happy ceremony. (PRIYAMVADA <i>does so. Exit</i> ANUSUYA.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. Gautami, bid the worthy Sharngarava and
Sharadvata make ready to escort my daughter Shakuntala.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>listening</i>). Hurry, Anusuya, hurry! They are calling
the hermits who are going to Hastinapura. (<i>Enter</i> ANUSUYA, <i>with
materials for the ceremony</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. Come, dear, let us go. (<i>They walk about</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>looking ahead</i>). There is Shakuntala. She took the
ceremonial bath at sunrise, and now the hermit-women are giving her
rice-cakes and wishing her happiness. Let's go to her. (<i>They do so.
Enter</i> SHAKUNTALA <i>with attendants as described, and</i> GAUTAMI.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. Holy women, I salute you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Gautami</i>. My child, may you receive the happy title "queen," showing
that your husband honours you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Hermit-women</i>. My dear, may you become the mother of a hero. (<i>Exeunt
all but</i> GAUTAMI.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i> (<i>approaching</i>). Did you have a good bath, dear</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. Good morning, girls. Sit here.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i> (<i>seating themselves</i>). Now stand straight, while we
go through the happy ceremony.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. It has happened often enough, but I ought to be very
grateful to-day. Shall I ever be adorned by my friends again (<i>She
weeps</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two friends</i>. You ought not to weep, dear, at this happy time.
(<i>They wipe the tears away and adorn her</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i>. You are so beautiful, you ought to have the finest gems.
It seems like an insult to give you these hermitage things. (<i>Enter</i>
HARITA, <i>a hermit-youth with ornaments</i>.) <i>Harita</i>. Here are
ornaments for our lady. (<i>The women look at them in astonishment</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Gautami</i>. Harita, my son, whence come these things</p><br>
<p>
<i>Harita</i>. From the holy power of Father Kanva.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Gautami</i>. A creation of his mind</p><br>
<p>
<i>Harita</i>. Not quite. Listen. Father Kanva sent us to gather blossoms
from the trees for Shakuntala, and then</p><br>

<p>
<i>Priyamvada</i> (<i>Looking at</i> SHAKUNTALA). A bee may be born in a hole in
a tree, but she likes the honey of the lotus.</p><br>

<i>Gautami</i>. This gracious favour is a token of the queenly happiness
which you are to enjoy in your husband's palace. (SHAKUNTALA <i>shows
embarrassment</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Harita</i>. Father Kanva has gone to the bank of the Malini, to perform
his ablutions. I will tell him of the favour shown us by the trees.
(<i>Exit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Anusuya</i>. My dear, we poor girls never saw such ornaments. How shall
we adorn you (<i>She stops to think, and to look at the ornaments</i>.)
But we have seen pictures. Perhaps we can arrange them right.</p><br>

<p>
The king is within. I will tell him of the urgent business which
demands his attention. (<i>He takes a few steps</i>.) But what is the
business (<i>He recalls it</i>.) Yes, I remember. Certain hermits, pupils
of Kanva, desire to see his Majesty. Strange, strange!</p><br>

In truth, I hesitate to announce the coming of Kanva's pupils to the
king. For he has this moment risen from the throne of justice. But
kings are never weary. For</p><br>

lotus-leaf cup full of water.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. I hear you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i>. At that moment the fawn came up, my adopted son. Then
you took pity on him and coaxed him. "Let him drink first," you said.
But he did not know you, and he would not come to drink water from
your hand. But he liked it afterwards, when I held the very same
water. Then you smiled and said: "It is true. Every one trusts his own
sort. You both belong to the forest."</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. It is just such women, selfish, sweet, false, that entice
fools. <i>Gautami</i>. You have no right to say that. She grew up in the
pious grove. She does not know how to deceive.</p><br>

<br>
SEPARATION FROM SHAKUNTALA
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
SCENE I.<i>In the street before the Palace</i></p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
(<i>Enter the chief of police, two policemen, and a man with his hands
bound behind his back</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two policemen</i> (<i>striking the man</i>). Now, pickpocket, tell us
where you found this ring. It is the king's ring, with letters
engraved on it, and it has a magnificent great gem.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i> (<i>showing fright</i>). Be merciful, kind gentlemen. I am not
guilty of such a crime.</p><br>
<p>
<i>First policeman</i>. No, I suppose the king thought you were a pious
Brahman, and made you a present of it.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. Listen, please. I am a fisherman, and I live on the
Ganges, at the spot where Indra came down.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Second policeman</i>. You thief, we didn't ask for your address or your
social position.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Let him tell a straight story, Suchaka. Don't interrupt.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two policemen</i>. Yes, chief. Talk, man, talk.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. I support my family with things you catch fish
withnets, you know, and hooks, and things.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i> (<i>laughing</i>). You have a sweet trade.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. Don't say that, master.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">You can't give up a lowdown trade<br></span>
<span class="i2">That your ancestors began;<br></span>
<span class="i2">A butcher butchers things, and yet<br></span>
<span class="i2">He's the tenderest-hearted man.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Go on. Go on.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. Well, one day I was cutting up a carp. In its maw I see
this ring with the magnificent great gem. And then I was just trying
to sell it here when you kind gentlemen grabbed me. That is the only
way I got it. Now kill me, or find fault with me.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i> (<i>smelling the ring</i>). There is no doubt about it, Januka.
It has been in a fish's maw. It has the real perfume of raw meat. Now
we have to find out how he got it. We must go to the palace.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two policemen</i> (<i>to the fisherman</i>). Move on, you cutpurse, move
on. (<i>They walk about</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Suchaka, wait here at the big gate until I come out of the
palace. And don't get careless.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two policemen</i>. Go in, chief. I hope the king will be nice to
you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Good-bye. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Suchaka</i>. Januka, the chief is taking his time.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Januka</i>. You can't just drop in on a king.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Suchaka</i>. Januka, my fingers are itching (<i>indicating the fisherman</i>)
to kill this cutpurse.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. Don't kill a man without any reason, master.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Januka</i> (<i>looking ahead</i>). There is the chief, with a written order
from the king. (<i>To the fisherman</i>.) Now you will see your family, or
else you will feed the crows and jackals. (<i>Enter the chief</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Quick! Quick! (<i>He breaks off</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. Oh, oh! I'm a dead man. (<i>He shows dejection</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Release him, you. Release the fishnet fellow. It is all
right, his getting the ring. Our king told me so himself.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Suchaka</i>. All right, chief. He is a dead man come back to life. (<i>He
releases the fisherman</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i> (<i>bowing low to the chief</i>). Master, I owe you my life.
(<i>He falls at his feet</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. Get up, get up! Here is a reward that the king was kind
enough to give you. It is worth as much as the ring. Take it. (<i>He
hands the fisherman a bracelet</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i> (<i>joyfully taking it</i>). Much obliged.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Januka</i>. He <i>is</i> much obliged to the king. Just as if he had been
taken from the stake and put on an elephant's back.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Suchaka</i>. Chief, the reward shows that the king thought a lot of the
ring. The gem must be worth something.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. No, it wasn't the fine gem that pleased the king. It was this
way.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two policemen</i>. Well</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chief</i>. I think, when the king saw it, he remembered somebody he
loves. You know how dignified he is usually. But as soon as he saw it,
he broke down for a moment.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Suchaka</i>. You have done the king a good turn, chief.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Januka</i>. All for the sake of this fish-killer, it seems to me. (<i>He
looks enviously at the fisherman</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Fisherman</i>. Take half of it, masters, to pay for something to drink.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Januka</i>. Fisherman, you are the biggest and best friend I've got. The
first thing we want, is all the brandy we can hold. Let's go where
they keep it. (<i>Exeunt omnes</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
SCENE II.<i>In the Palace Gardens</i></p><br>
<p>
(<i>Enter</i> MISHRAKESHI, <i>flying through the air</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. I have taken my turn in waiting upon the nymphs. And
now I will see what this good king is doing. Shakuntala is like a
second self to me, because she is the daughter of Menaka. And it was
she who asked me to do this. (<i>She looks about</i>.) It is the day of the
spring festival. But I see no preparations for a celebration at court.
I might learn the reason by my power of divination. But I must do as
my friend asked me. Good! I will make myself invisible and stand near
these girls who take care of the garden. I shall find out that way.
(<i>She descends to earth. Enter a maid, gazing at a mango branch, and
behind her, a second</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>First maid</i>.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">First mango-twig, so pink, so green,<br></span>

<span class="i2">A festival offering.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Second maid</i>. What are you chirping about to yourself, little cuckoo</p><br>
<p>
<i>First maid</i>. Why, little bee, you know that the cuckoo goes crazy
with delight when she sees the mango-blossom.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Second maid</i> (<i>joyfully</i>). Oh, has the spring really come</p><br>
<p>
<i>First maid</i>. Yes, little bee. And this is the time when you too buzz
about in crazy joy. <i>Second maid</i>. Hold me, dear, while I stand on
tiptoe and offer this blossom to Love, the divine.</p><br>
<p>
<i>First maid</i>. If I do, you must give me half the reward of the
offering.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Second maid</i>. That goes without saying, dear. We two are one. (<i>She
leans on her friend and takes the mango-blossom</i>.) Oh, see! The
mango-blossom hasn't opened, but it has broken the sheath, so it is
fragrant. (<i>She brings her hands together</i>.) I worship mighty Love.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">O mango-twig I give to Love<br></span>

</blockquote>
<p>
(<i>She throws the twig. Enter the chamberlain</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i> (<i>angrily</i>). Stop, silly girl. The king has strictly
forbidden the spring festival. Do you dare pluck the mango-blossoms</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two maids</i> (<i>frightened</i>). Forgive us, sir. We did not know.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i>. What! You have not heard the king's command, which is
obeyed even by the trees of spring and the creatures that dwell in
them. See!</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">The mango branches are in bloom,<br></span>

</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. There is no doubt of it. This good king has wonderful
power.</p><br>
<p>
<i>First maid</i>. A few days ago, sir, we were sent to his Majesty by his
brother-in-law Mitravasu to decorate the garden. That is why we have
heard nothing of this affair.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i>. You must not do so again.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two maids</i>. But we are curious. If we girls may know about it,
pray tell us, sir. Why did his Majesty forbid the spring festival
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. Kings are fond of celebrations. There must be some good
reason.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It is in everybody's mouth. Why should I
not tell it (<i>Aloud</i>.) Have you heard the gossip concerning
Shakuntala's rejection</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two maids</i>. Yes, sir. The king's brother-in-law told us, up to
the point where the ring was recovered.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i>. There is little more to tell. When his Majesty saw the
ring, he remembered that he had indeed contracted a secret marriage
with Shakuntala, and had rejected her under a delusion. And then he
fell a prey to remorse.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">He hates the things he loved; he intermits<br></span>
<span class="i2">The daily audience, nor in judgment sits;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Spends sleepless nights in tossing on his bed;<br></span>
<span class="i2">At times, when he by courtesy is led<br></span>
<span class="i2">To address a lady, speaks another name,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Then stands for minutes, sunk in helpless shame.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. I am glad to hear it.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i>. His Majesty's sorrow has forbidden the festival.</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two maids</i>. It is only right.</p><br>
<p>
<i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. Follow me.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i> (<i>listening</i>). Ah, his Majesty approaches. Go, and
attend to your duties. (<i>Exeunt the two maids. Enter the king, wearing
a dress indicative of remorse; the clown, and the portress</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i> (<i>observing the king</i>). A beautiful figure charms in
whatever state. Thus, his Majesty is pleasing even in his sorrow. For</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">All ornament is laid aside; he wears<br></span>
<span class="i4">One golden bracelet on his wasted arm;<br></span>
<span class="i2">His lip is scorched by sighs; and sleepless cares<br></span>
<span class="i4">Redden his eyes. Yet all can work no harm<br></span>
<span class="i2">On that magnificent beauty, wasting, but<br></span>
<span class="i2">Gaining in brilliance, like a diamond cut.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i> (<i>observing the king</i>). No wonder Shakuntala pines for
him, even though he dishonoured her by his rejection of her.</p><br> <p><i>King</i> (<i>walks about slowly, sunk in thought</i>).</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">Alas! My smitten heart, that once lay sleeping,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Heard in its dreams my fawn-eyed love's laments,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And wakened now, awakens but to weeping,<br></span>
<span class="i4">To bitter grief, and tears of penitence.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. That is the poor girl's fate.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i> (<i>to himself</i>). He has got his Shakuntala-sickness again. I
wish I knew how to cure him.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain (advancing)</i>. Victory to your Majesty. I have examined
the garden. Your Majesty may visit its retreats.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Vetravati, tell the minister Pishuna in my name that a
sleepless night prevents me from mounting the throne of judgment. He
is to investigate the citizens' business and send me a memorandum.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Portress</i>. Yes, your Majesty. <i>(Exit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. And you, Parvatayana, return to your post of duty.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Chamberlain</i>. Yes, your Majesty. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. You have got rid of the vermin. Now amuse yourself in this
garden. It is delightful with the passing of the cold weather.</p><br>
<p>

Misfortune finds the weak spot. See!</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Wait a minute, man. I will destroy Love's arrow with my
stick. (<i>He raises his stick and strikes at the mango branch</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Enough! I see your pious power. My friend, where
shall I sit now to comfort my eyes with the vines They remind me
somehow of her.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Well, you told one of the maids, the clever painter, that
you would spend this hour in the bower of spring-creepers. And you
asked her to bring you there the picture of the lady Shakuntala which
you painted on a tablet.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. It is my only consolation. Lead the way to the bower of
spring-creepers.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Follow me. (<i>They walk about</i>. MISHRAKESHI <i>follows</i>.) Here
is the bower of spring-creepers, with its jewelled benches. Its
loneliness seems to bid you a silent welcome. Let us go in and sit
down. (<i>They do so</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. I will hide among the vines and see the dear girl's
picture. Then I shall be able to tell her how deep her husband's love
is. (<i>She hides</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>sighing</i>). I remember it all now, my friend. I told you how I
first met Shakuntala. It is true, you were not with me when I rejected
her. But I had told you of her at the first. Had you forgotten, as I
did</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. This shows that a king should not be separated a single
moment from some intimate friend.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. No, I didn't forget. But when you had told the whole story,
you said it was a joke and there was nothing in it. And I was fool
enough to believe you. No, this is the work of fate.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. It must be.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>after meditating a moment</i>). Help me, my friend.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. But, man, this isn't right at all. A good man never lets
grief get the upper hand. The mountains are calm even in a tempest.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. My friend, I am quite forlorn. I keep thinking of her pitiful
state when I rejected her. Thus:</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">When I denied her, then she tried<br></span>
<span class="i2">To join her people. "Stay," one cried,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Her father's representative.<br></span>
<span class="i2">She stopped, she turned, she could but give<br></span>
<span class="i2">A tear-dimmed glance to heartless me<br></span>
<span class="i2">That arrow burns me poisonously.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. How his fault distresses him!</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Well, I don't doubt it was some heavenly being that carried
her away.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Who else would dare to touch a faithful wife Her friends told
me that Menaka was her mother. My heart persuades me that it was
she, or companions of hers, who carried Shakuntala away.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. His madness was wonderful, not his awakening reason.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. But in that case, you ought to take heart. You will meet her
again.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. How so</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Why, a mother or a father cannot long bear to see a daughter
separated from her husband.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. My friend,</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">And was it phantom, madness, dream,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Or fatal retribution stern<br></span>
<span class="i2">My hopes fell down a precipice<br></span>
<span class="i4">And never, never will return.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Don't talk that way. Why, the ring shows that incredible
meetings do happen.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>looking at the ring</i>). This ring deserves pity. It has fallen
from a heaven hard to earn.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">Your virtue, ring, like mine,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Is proved to be but small;<br></span>

<span class="i4">You clasped. How could you fall<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. If it were worn on any other hand, it would deserve
pity. My dear girl, you are far away. I am the only one to hear these
delightful words.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Tell me how you put the ring on her finger.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. He speaks as if prompted by my curiosity.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Listen, my friend. When I left the pious grove for the city,
my darling wept and said: "But how long will you remember us, dear"</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. And then you said--</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Then I put this engraved ring on her finger, and said to
her--</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Well, what</p><br>
<p>

<p>
Then, through my madness, it fell out cruelly. <i>Mishrakeshi</i>. It was
too charming an agreement to be frustrated by fate.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. But how did it get into a carp's mouth, as if it had been a
fish-hook</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. While she was worshipping the Ganges at Shachitirtha, it fell.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. I see.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. That is why the virtuous king doubted his marriage with
poor Shakuntala. Yet such love does not ask for a token. How could it
have been</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Well, I can only reproach this ring.</p><br>
<p>

<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. He has given the answer which I had ready.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. But that is no reason why I should starve to death.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>not heeding</i>). O my darling, my heart burns with repentance
because I abandoned you without reason. Take pity on me. Let me see
you again. (<i>Enter a maid with a tablet</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Your Majesty, here is the picture of our lady. (<i>She produces
the tablet</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>gazing at it</i>). It is a beautiful picture. See!</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">A graceful arch of brows above great eyes;<br></span>

<span class="i2">The picture speaks, with living beauty warm.<br></span> </p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Clown</i> (<i>looking at it</i>). The sketch is full of sweet meaning. My
eyes seem to stumble over its uneven surface. What more can I say I
expect to see it come to life, and I feel like speaking to it.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. The king is a clever painter. I seem to see the dear
girl before me.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. My friend,</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">

<span class="i2">What in the picture is not fair,<br></span>

</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. There are three figures in the picture, and they are all
beautiful. Which one is the lady Shakuntala</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. The poor fellow never saw her beauty. His eyes are
useless, for she never came before them.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Which one do you think</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i> (<i>observing closely</i>). I think it is this one, leaning against
the creeper which she has just sprinkled. Her face is hot and the
flowers are dropping from her hair; for the ribbon is loosened. Her
arms droop like weary branches; she has loosened her girdle, and she
seems a little fatigued. This, I think, is the lady Shakuntala, the
others are her friends.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. You are good at guessing. Besides, here are proofs of my love.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">

<p>
Chaturika, I have not finished the background. Go, get the brushes.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Please hold the picture, Madhavya, while I am gone.</p><br>

<p><i>King</i>. I will hold it. (<i>He does so. Exit maid</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. What are you going to add</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. Surely, every spot that the dear girl loved.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Listen, my friend.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">

<p>
<i>Clown</i> (<i>aside</i>). To hear him talk, I should think he was going to
fill up the picture with heavy-bearded hermits.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. And another ornament that Shakuntala loved I have forgotten to
paint.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. What</p><br>
<p>

<p>

pink water-lily She seems frightened. (<i>He looks more closely</i>.) I
see. Here is a bold, bad bee. He steals honey, and so he flies to her
lotus-face.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Drive him away.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. It is your affair to punish evil-doers.</p><br>
<p>

your time in buzzing here</p><br>

<p>
<i>Clown</i>. Well, he doesn't seem afraid of your dreadful punishment.
(<i>Laughing. To himself</i>.) The man is crazy, and I am just as bad, from
associating with him.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Will he not go, though I warn him</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. Love works a curious change even in a brave man.</p><br>
<p>

<p>

<p>

experiences.</p><br>

<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. My friend, you have indeed atonedand in her friend's
presencefor the pain you caused by rejecting dear Shakuntala.
(<i>Enter the maid</i> CHATURIKA.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Your Majesty, I was coming back with the box of
paint-brushes--</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Well</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. I met Queen Vasumati with the maid Pingalika. And the queen
snatched the box from me, saying: "I will take it to the king myself."</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. How did you escape</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. The queen's dress caught on a vine. And while her maid was
setting her free, I excused myself in a hurry. <i>A voice behind the
scenes</i>. Follow me, your Majesty.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i> (<i>listening</i>). Man, the she-tiger of the palace is making a
spring on her prey. She means to make one mouthful of the maid.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. My friend, the queen has come because she feels touched in her
honour. You had better take care of this picture.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Clown</i>. "And yourself," you might add. (<i>He takes the picture and
rises</i>.) If you get out of the trap alive, call for me at the Cloud
Balcony. And I will hide the thing there so that nothing but a pigeon
could find it. (<i>Exit on the run</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mishrakeshi</i>. Though his heart is given to another, he is courteous
to his early flame. He is a constant friend.</p><br>
<p>
(<i>Enter the portress with a document</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Portress</i>. Victory to your Majesty.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Vetravati, did you not meet Queen Vasumati</p><br>
<p>
<i>Portress</i>. Yes, your Majesty. But she turned back when she saw that I
carried a document.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. The queen knows times and seasons. She will not interrupt
business.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Portress</i>. Your Majesty, the minister sends word that in the press of
various business he has attended to only one citizen's suit. This he
has reduced to writing for your Majesty's perusal.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Give me the document. (<i>The portress does so</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>reads</i>). "Be it known to his Majesty. A seafaring merchant
named Dhanavriddhi has been lost in a shipwreck. He is childless, and
his property, amounting to several millions, reverts to the crown.
Will his Majesty take action" (<i>Sadly</i>.) It is dreadful to be
childless. Vetravati, he had great riches. There must be several
wives. Let inquiry be made. There may be a wife who is with child.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Portress</i>. We have this moment heard that a merchant's daughter of
Saketa is his wife. And she is soon to become a mother.</p><br>
<p>

minister.</p><br>
<p>

<p>

the death of the head of the family, to a stranger. When I die, it

<p>

of your years, and the birth of a son to one of your other wives will
make you blameless before your ancestors. (<i>To herself</i>.) He does not
heed me. The proper medicine is needed for any disease. <i>King</i>

<p>

the gods consoling Shakuntala. She said that the gods, impatient for
the sacrifice, would soon cause him to welcome his true wife. I must
delay no longer. I will comfort dear Shakuntala with my tidings.
(<i>Exit through the air</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. Help, help!</p><br>
<p>

not catch poor Madhavya with the picture in his hands.</p><br>

<br>
<p>
(<i>Enter, in a chariot that flies through the air, the king and</i>
MATALI.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Matali, though I have done what Indra commanded, I think
myself an unprofitable servant, when I remember his most gracious
welcome.</p><br>

<p>
<i>King</i>. Ah, no! For the honour given me at parting went far beyond
imagination. Before the gods, he seated me beside him on his throne.
And then</p><br>

winds are we</p><br>

<p>

the path taken by the chariot</i>.) It seems that we have descended into
the region of the clouds.</p><br>

<p>
<i>Matali</i>. You are right. And in a moment you will be in the world over

<p>
<i>Matali</i>. You are a good observer, O King. (<i>He looks down,
awe-struck</i>.) There is a noble loveliness in the earth. <i>King</i>.
Matali, what mountain is this, its flanks sinking into the eastern and
into the western sea It drips liquid gold like a cloud at sunset.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Matali</i>. O King, this is Gold Peak, the mountain of the fairy
centaurs. Here it is that ascetics most fully attain to magic powers.

<p>

terribly.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Matali</i> (<i>checking the chariot</i>). We have entered the hermitage of
the ancient sage, whose wife Aditi tends the coral-trees. <i>King</i>.
Here is deeper contentment than in heaven. I seem plunged in a pool of
nectar.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Matali</i> (<i>stopping the chariot</i>). Descend, O King.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>descending</i>). But how will you fare</p><br>
<p>
<i>Matali</i>. The chariot obeys the word of command. I too will descend.
(<i>He does so</i>.) Before you, O King, are the groves where the holiest
hermits lead their self-denying life.</p><br>

they might enjoy.</p><br>

<p>

speaks to some one not visible</i>.) Ancient Shakalya, how is Marichi's
holy son occupied (<i>He listens</i>.) What do you say That he is
explaining to Aditi, in answer to her question, the duties of a
faithful wife My matter must await a fitter time. (<i>He turns to the
king</i>.) Wait here, O King, in the shade of the ashoka tree, till I
have announced your coming to the sire of Indra.</p><br>

<p>
<i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. Don't! You mustn't be so foolhardy. Oh,
you are always the same.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>listening</i>). No naughtiness could feel at home in this spot.
Who draws such a rebuke upon himself (<i>He looks towards the sound. In

children to us. Your energy seems to take the form of striking
something. No wonder the hermits call you All-tamer.</p><br>

<p>

<p>
<i>King</i>. Why do you say that, mother

<i>Hermit-woman</i>. I am astonished to see how much the boy looks like
you, sir. You are not related. Besides, he is a perverse little
creature and he does not know you. Yet he takes no dislike to you.</p><br>

<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>caressing the boy</i>). Mother, if he is not the son of a
hermit, what is his family</p><br>
<p>
<i>Hermit-woman</i>. The family of Puru.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). He is of one family with me! Then could my
thought be true (<i>Aloud</i>.) But this is the custom of Puru's line:</p><br>

<p>
But how could human beings, of their own mere motion, attain this
spot</p><br>
<p>
<i>Hermit-woman</i>. You are quite right, sir. But the boy's mother was
related to a nymph, and she bore her son in the pious grove of the
father of the gods.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Ah, a second ground for hope. (<i>Aloud</i>.) What
was the name of the good king whose wife she was</p><br>
<p>
<i>Hermit-woman</i>. Who would speak his name He rejected his true wife.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This story points at me. Suppose I ask the boy
for his mother's name. (<i>He reflects</i>.) No, it is wrong to concern
myself with one who may be another's wife.</p><br>
<p>
(<i>Enter the first woman, with the clay peacock</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>First woman</i>. Look, All-tamer. Here is the bird, the <i>shakunta</i>.
Isn't the <i>shakunta</i> lovely</p><br>
<p>
<i>Boy</i> (<i>looks about</i>). Where is my mamma (<i>The two women burst out
laughing</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>First woman</i>. It sounded like her name, and deceived him. He loves
his mother.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Second woman</i>. She said: "See how pretty the peacock is." That is
all.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). His mother's name is Shakuntala! But names are
alike. I trust this hope may not prove a disappointment in the end,
like a mirage.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Boy</i>. I like this little peacock, sister. Can it fly (<i>He seizes the
toy</i>.) <i>First woman</i> (<i>looks at the boy. Anxiously</i>), Oh, the amulet
is not on his wrist.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Do not be anxious, mother. It fell while he was struggling
with the lion cub. (<i>He starts to pick it up</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>The two women</i>. Oh, don't, don't! (<i>They look at him</i>.) He has
touched it! (<i>Astonished, they lay their hands on their bosoms, and
look at each other</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Why did you try to prevent me</p><br>
<p>
<i>First woman</i>. Listen, your Majesty. This is a divine and most potent
charm, called the Invincible. Marichi's holy son gave it to the baby
when the birth-ceremony was performed. If it falls on the ground, no
one may touch it except the boy's parents or the boy himself.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. And if another touch it</p><br>
<p>
<i>First woman</i>. It becomes a serpent and stings him.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. Did you ever see this happen to any one else</p><br>
<p>
<i>Both women</i>. More than once.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>joyfully</i>). Then why may I not welcome my hopes fulfilled at
last (<i>He embraces the boy</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Second woman</i>. Come, Suvrata. Shakuntala is busy with her religious
duties. We must go and tell her what has happened. (<i>Exeunt ambo</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Boy</i>. Let me go. I want to see my mother.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. My son, you shall go with me to greet your mother.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Boy</i>. Dushyanta is my father, not you.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>smiling</i>). You show I am right by contradicting me. (<i>Enter</i>
SHAKUNTALA, <i>wearing her hair in a single braid</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). I have heard that All-tamer's amulet did
not change when it should have done so. But I do not trust my own
happiness. Yet perhaps it is as Mishrakeshi told me. (<i>She walks
about</i>.)</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i> (<i>looking at</i> SHAKUNTALA. <i>With plaintive joy</i>). It is she. It
is Shakuntala.</p><br>

<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>seeing the king pale with remorse. Doubtfully</i>). It is
not my husband. Who is the man that soils my boy with his caresses
The amulet should protect him. <i>Boy</i> (<i>running to his mother</i>).
Mother, he is a man that belongs to other people. And he calls me his
son.</p><br>
<p>
<i>King</i>. My darling, the cruelty I showed you has turned to happiness.
Will you not recognise me</p><br>
<p>
<i>Shakuntala</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Oh, my heart, believe it. Fate struck
hard, but its envy is gone and pity takes its place. It is my husband.</p><br>

<h2>THE STORY OF SHAKUNTALA</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

<p>
In the first book of the vast epic poem <i>Mahabharata</i>, Kalidasa found
the story of Shakuntala. The story has a natural place there, for
Bharata, Shakuntala's son, is the eponymous ancestor of the princes
who play the leading part in the epic.</p><br>
<p>
With no little abbreviation of its epic breadth, the story runs as
follows:</p><br>
<b>
THE EPIC TALE</b>
<p>
Once that strong-armed king, with a mighty host of men and chariots,
entered a thick wood. Then when the king had slain thousands of wild
creatures, he entered another wood with his troops and his chariots,
intent on pursuing a deer. And the king beheld a wonderful, beautiful
hermitage on the bank of the sacred river Malini; on its bank was the
beautiful hermitage of blessd, high-souled Kanva, whither the great
sages resorted. Then the king determined to enter, that he might see
the great sage Kanva, rich in holiness. He laid aside the insignia of
royalty and went on alone, but did not see the austere sage in the
hermitage. Then, when he did not see the sage, and perceived that the
hermitage was deserted, he cried aloud, "Who is here" until the
forest seemed to shriek. Hearing his cry, a maiden, lovely as Shri,
came from the hermitage, wearing a hermit garb. "Welcome!" she said at
once, greeting him, and smilingly added: "What may be done for you"
Then the king said to the sweet-voiced maid: "I have come to pay
reverence to the holy sage Kanva. Where has the blessd one gone,
sweet girl Tell me this, lovely maid." Shakuntala said: "My blessd
father has gone from the hermitage to gather fruits. Wait a moment.
You shall see him when he returns."</p><br>
<p>
The king did not see the sage, but when the lovely girl of the fair
hips and charming smile spoke to him, he saw that she was radiant
in her beauty, yes, in her hard vows and self-restraint all youth and
beauty, and he said to her:</p><br>
<p>
"Who are you Whose are you, lovely maiden Why did you come to the
forest Whence are you, sweet girl, so lovely and so good Your beauty
stole my heart at the first glance. I wish to know you better. Answer
me, sweet maid."</p><br>
<p>
The maiden laughed when thus questioned by the king in the hermitage,
and the words she spoke were very sweet: "O Dushyanta, I am known as
blessed Kanva's daughter, and he is austere, steadfast, wise, and of a
lofty soul."</p><br>
<p>
Dushyanta said: "But he is chaste, glorious maid, holy, honoured by
the world. Though virtue should swerve from its course, he would not
swerve from the hardness of his vow. How were you born his daughter,
for you are beautiful I am in great perplexity about this. Pray
remove it."</p><br>
<p>
[Shakuntala here explains how she is the child of a sage and a nymph,
deserted at birth, cared for by birds (<i>shakuntas</i>), found and reared
by Kanva, who gave her the name Shakuntala.]</p><br>
<p>
Dushyanta said: "You are clearly a king's daughter, sweet maiden, as
you say. Become my lovely wife. Tell me, what shall I do for you Let
all my kingdom be yours to-day. Become my wife, sweet maid."</p><br>
<p>
Shakuntala said: "Promise me truly what I say to you in secret. The
son that is born to me must be your heir. If you promise, Dushyanta, I
will marry you."</p><br>
<p>
"So be it," said the king without thinking, and added: "I will bring
you too to my city, sweet-smiling girl.</p><br>
<p>
So the king took the faultlessly graceful maiden by the hand and dwelt
with her. And when he had bidden her be of good courage, he went
forth, saying again and again: "I will send a complete army for you,
and tell them to bring my sweet-smiling bride to my palace." When he
had made this promise, the king went thoughtfully to find Kanva. "What
will he do when he hears it, this holy, austere man" he wondered, and
still thinking, he went back to his capital.</p><br>
<p>
Now the moment he was gone, Kanva came to the hermitage. And
Shakuntala was ashamed and did not come to meet her father. But
blessed, austere Kanva had divine discernment. He discovered her, and
seeing the matter with celestial vision, he was pleased and said:
"What you have done, dear, to-day, forgetting me and meeting a man,
this does not break the law. A man who loves may marry secretly the
woman who loves him without a ceremony; and Dushyanta is virtuous and
noble, the best of men. Since you have found a loving husband,
Shakuntala, a noble son shall be born to you, mighty in the world."</p><br>
<p>
Sweet Shakuntala gave birth to a boy of unmeasured prowess. His hands
were marked with the wheel, and he quickly grew to be a glorious boy.
As a six years' child in Kanva's hermitage he rode on the backs of
lions, tigers, and boars near the hermitage, and tamed them, and ran
about playing with them. Then those who lived in Kanva's hermitage
gave him a name. "Let him be called All-tamer," they said: "for he
tames everything."</p><br>
<p>
But when the sage saw the boy and his more than human deeds, he said
to Shakuntala: "It is time for him to be anointed crown prince." When
he saw how strong the boy was, Kanva said to his pupils: "Quickly
bring my Shakuntala and her son from my house to her husband's palace.
A long abiding with their relatives is not proper for married women.
It destroys their reputation, and their character, and their virtue;
so take her without delay." "We will," said all the mighty men, and
they set out with Shakuntala and her son for Gajasahvaya.</p><br>
<p>
When Shakuntala drew near, she was recognised and invited to enter,
and she said to the king: "This is your son, O King. You must anoint
him crown prince, just as you promised before, when we met."</p><br>
<p>
When the king heard her, although he remembered her, he said: "I do
not remember. To whom do you belong, you wicked hermit-woman I do not
remember a union with you for virtue, love, and wealth.
[1] Either go
or stay, or do whatever you wish."</p><br>
<p>
When he said this, the sweet hermit-girl half fainted from shame and
grief, and stood stiff as a pillar. Her eyes darkened with passionate
indignation; her lips quivered; she seemed to consume the king as she
gazed at him with sidelong glances. Concealing her feelings and nerved
by anger, she held in check the magic power that her ascetic life
had given her. She seemed to meditate a moment, overcome by grief and
anger. She gazed at her husband, then spoke passionately: "O shameless
king, although you know, why do you say, 'I do not know,' like any
other ordinary man"</p><br>
<p>
Dushyanta said: "I do not know the son born of you, Shakuntala. Women
are liars. Who will believe what you say Are you not ashamed to say
these incredible things, especially in my presence You wicked
hermit-woman, go!"</p><br>
<p>
Shakuntala said: "O King, sacred is holy God, and sacred is a holy
promise. Do not break your promise, O King. Let your love be sacred.
If you cling to a lie, and will not believe, alas! I must go away;
there is no union with a man like you. For even without you,
Dushyanta, my son shall rule this foursquare earth adorned with kingly
mountains."</p><br>
<p>
When she had said so much to the king, Shakuntala started to go. But a
bodiless voice from heaven said to Dushyanta: "Care for your son,
Dushyanta. Do not despise Shakuntala. You are the boy's father.
Shakuntala tells the truth."</p><br>
<p>
When he heard the utterance of the gods, the king joyfully said to his
chaplain and his ministers: "Hear the words of this heavenly
messenger. If I had received my son simply because of her words, he
would be suspected by the world, he would not be pure."</p><br>
<p>
Then the king received his son gladly and joyfully. He kissed his head
and embraced him lovingly. His wife also Dushyanta honoured, as
justice required. And the king soothed her, and said: "This union
which I had with you was hidden from the world. Therefore I hesitated,
O Queen, in order to save your reputation. And as for the cruel words
you said to me in an excess of passion, these I pardon you, my
beautiful, great-eyed darling, because you love me."</p><br>
<p>
Then King Dushyanta gave the name Bharata to Shakuntala's son, and had
him anointed crown prince.</p><br>
<p>
It is plain that this story contains the material for a good play; the
very form of the epic tale is largely dramatic. It is also plain, in a
large way, of what nature are the principal changes which a dramatist
must introduce in the original. For while Shakuntala is charming in
the epic story, the king is decidedly contemptible. Somehow or
other, his face must be saved.</p><br>
<p>
To effect this, Kalidasa has changed the old story in three important
respects. In the first place, he introduces the curse of Durvasas,
clouding the king's memory, and saving him from moral responsibility
in his rejection of Shakuntala. That there may be an ultimate recovery
of memory, the curse is so modified as to last only until the king
shall see again the ring which he has given to his bride. To the
Hindu, curse and modification are matters of frequent occurrence; and
Kalidasa has so delicately managed the matter as not to shock even a
modern and Western reader with a feeling of strong improbability. Even
to us it seems a natural part of the divine cloud that envelops the
drama, in no way obscuring human passion, but rather giving to human
passion an unwonted largeness and universality.</p><br>
<p>
In the second place, the poet makes Shakuntala undertake her journey
to the palace before her son is born. Obviously, the king's character
is thus made to appear in a better light, and a greater probability is
given to the whole story.</p><br>
<p>
The third change is a necessary consequence of the first; for without
the curse, there could have been no separation, no ensuing remorse,
and no reunion.</p><br>
<p>
But these changes do not of themselves make a drama out of the epic
tale. Large additions were also necessary, both of scenes and of
characters. We find, indeed, that only acts one and five, with a part
of act seven, rest upon the ancient text, while acts two, three, four,
and six, with most of seven, are a creation of the poet. As might have
been anticipated, the acts of the former group are more dramatic,
while those of the latter contribute more of poetical charm. It is
with these that scissors must be chiefly busy when the playrather
too long for continuous presentation as it standsis performed on the
stage.</p><br>
<p>
In the epic there are but three charactersDushyanta, Shakuntala,
Kanva, with the small boy running about in the background. To these
Kalidasa has added from the palace, from the hermitage, and from the
Elysian region which is represented with vague precision in the last
act.</p><br>
<p>
The conventional clown plays a much smaller part in this play than in
the others which Kalidasa wrote. He has also less humour. The real
humorous relief is given by the fisherman and the three policemen in
the opening scene of the sixth act. This, it may be remarked, is the
only scene of rollicking humour in Kalidasa's writing.</p><br>
<p>
The forest scenes are peopled with quiet hermit-folk. Far the most
charming of these are Shakuntala's girl friends. The two are
beautifully differentiated: Anusuya grave, sober; Priyamvada
vivacious, saucy; yet wonderfully united in friendship and in devotion
to Shakuntala, whom they feel to possess a deeper nature than theirs.</p><br>
<p>
Kanva, the hermit-father, hardly required any change from the epic
Kanva. It was a happy thought to place beside him the staid, motherly
Gautami. The small boy in the last act has magically become an
individual in Kalidasa's hands. In this act too are the creatures of a
higher world, their majesty not rendered too precise.</p><br>
<p>
Dushyanta has been saved by the poet from his epic shabbiness; it may
be doubted whether more has been done. There is in him, as in some
other Hindu heroes, a shade too much of the meditative to suit our
ideal of more alert and ready manhood.</p><br>
<p>
But all the other characters sink into insignificance beside the
heroine. Shakuntala dominates the play. She is actually on the stage
in five of the acts, and her spirit pervades the other two, the second
and the sixth. Shakuntala has held captive the heart of India for
fifteen hundred years, and wins the love of increasing thousands in
the West; for so noble a union of sweetness with strength is one of
the miracles of art.</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>

 Though lovely women walk the world to-day
 By tens of thousands, there is none so fair
 In all that exhibition and display
 With her most perfect beauty to compare
</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
because it is a most perfect beauty of soul no less than of outward
form. Her character grows under our very eyes. When we first meet her,
she is a simple maiden, knowing no greater sorrow than the death of a
favourite deer; when we bid her farewell, she has passed through happy
love, the mother's joys and pains, most cruel humiliation and
suspicion, and the reunion with her husband, proved at last not to
have been unworthy. And each of these great experiences has been met
with a courage and a sweetness to which no words can render justice.</p><br>
<p>
Kalidasa has added much to the epic tale; yet his use of the original
is remarkably minute. A list of the epic suggestions incorporated in
his play is long. But it is worth making, in order to show how keen is
the eye of genius. Thus the king lays aside the insignia of royalty
upon entering the grove (Act I). Shakuntala appears in hermit garb, a
dress of bark (Act I). The quaint derivation of the heroine's name
from <i>shakunta</i>birdis used with wonderful skill in a passage (Act
VII) which defies translation, as it involves a play on words. The
king's anxiety to discover whether the maiden's father is of a caste
that permits her to marry him is reproduced (Act I). The marriage
without a ceremony is retained (Act IV), but robbed of all offence.
Kanva's celestial vision, which made it unnecessary for his child to
tell him of her union with the king, is introduced with great delicacy
(Act IV). The curious formation of the boy's hand which indicated
imperial birth adds to the king's suspense (Act VII). The boy's rough
play with wild animals is made convincing (Act VII) and his very
nickname All-tamer is preserved (Act VII). Kanva's worldly wisdom as
to husband and wife dwelling together is reproduced (Act IV). No small
part of the give-and-take between the king and Shakuntala is given
(Act V), but with a new dignity.</p><br>
<p>
Of the construction of the play I speak with diffidence. It seems
admirable to me, the apparently undue length of some scenes hardly
constituting a blemish, as it was probably intended to give the actors
considerable latitude of choice and excision. Several versions of the
text have been preserved; it is from the longer of the two more
familiar ones that the translation in this volume has been made. In
the warm discussion over this matter, certain technical arguments of
some weight have been advanced in favour of this choice; there is also
a more general consideration which seems to me of importance. I find
it hard to believe that any lesser artist could pad such a
masterpiece, and pad it all over, without making the fraud apparent on
almost every page. The briefer version, on the other hand, might
easily grow out of the longer, either as an acting text, or as a
school-book.</p><br>
<p>
We cannot take leave of Shakuntala in any better way than by quoting
the passage
[2] in which Lvi's
imagination has conjured up "the
memorable <i>premire</i> when Shakuntala saw the light, in the presence of
Vikramaditya and his court."</p><br>

<h2>THE TWO MINOR DRAMAS</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

<b>I."MALAVIKA AND AGNIMITRA"</b>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<i>Malavika and Agnimitra</i> is the earliest of Kalidasa's three dramas,
and probably his earliest work. This conclusion would be almost
certain from the character of the play, but is put beyond doubt by the
following speeches of the prologue:</p><br>
<p>
<i>Stage-director</i>. The audience has asked us to present at this spring
festival a drama called <i>Malavika and Agnimitra</i>, composed by
Kalidasa. Let the music begin.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Assistant</i>. No, no! Shall we neglect the works of such illustrious
authors as Bhasa, Saumilla, and Kaviputra Can the audience feel any
respect for the work of a modern poet, a Kalidasa</p><br>
<p>
<i>Stage-director</i>. You are quite mistaken. Consider:</p><br>

<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">Not all is good that bears an ancient name,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Nor need we every modern poem blame:<br></span>
<span class="i2">Wise men approve the good, or new or old;<br></span>
<span class="i2">The foolish critic follows where he's told.<br></span>

</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Assistant</i>. The responsibility rests with you, sir.</p><br>
<p>
There is irony in the fact that the works of the illustrious authors
mentioned have perished, that we should hardly know of their existence
were it not for the tribute of their modest, youthful rival. But
Kalidasa could not read the future. We can imagine his feelings of
mingled pride and fear when his early work was presented at the spring
festival before the court of King Vikramaditya, without doubt the most
polished and critical audience that could at that hour have been
gathered in any city on earth. The play which sought the approbation
of this audience shows no originality of plot, no depth of passion.
It is a light, graceful drama of court intrigue. The hero, King
Agnimitra, is an historical character of the second century before
Christ, and Kalidasa's play gives us some information about him that
history can seriously consider. The play represents Agnimitra's
father, the founder of the Sunga dynasty, as still living. As the seat
of empire was in Patna on the Ganges, and as Agnimitra's capital is
Vidishathe modern Bhilsait seems that he served as regent of
certain provinces during his father's lifetime. The war with the King
of Vidarbha seems to be an historical occurrence, and the fight with
the Greek cavalry force is an echo of the struggle with Menander, in
which the Hindus were ultimately victorious. It was natural for
Kalidasa to lay the scene of his play in Bhilsa rather than in the
far-distant Patna, for it is probable that many in the audience were
acquainted with the former city. It is to Bhilsa that the poet refers
again in <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i>, where these words are addressed to the
cloud:</p><br>

<br>
<p>
The scene is the palace and gardens of King Agnimitra, the time a few
days.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT I</b>.After the usual prologue, the maid Bakulavalika appears with
another maid. From their conversation we learn that King Agnimitra has
seen in the palace picture-gallery a new painting of Queen Dharini
with her attendants. So beautiful is one of these, Malavika, that the
king is smitten with love, but is prevented by the jealous queen from
viewing the original. At this point the dancing-master Ganadasa
enters. From him Bakulavalika learns that Malavika is a wonderfully
proficient pupil, while he learns from her that Malavika had been sent
as a present to Queen Dharini by a general commanding a border
fortress, the queen's brother.</p><br>
<p>
After this introductory scene, the king enters, and listens to a
letter sent by the king of Vidarbha. The rival monarch had imprisoned
a prince and princess, cousins of Agnimitra, and in response to
Agnimitra's demand that they be set free, he declares that the
princess has escaped, but that the prince shall not be liberated
except on certain conditions. This letter so angers Agnimitra that he
despatches an army against the king of Vidarbha.</p><br>
<p>
Gautama, the clown, informs Agnimitra that he has devised a plan for
bringing Malavika into the king's presence. He has stirred an envious
rivalry in the bosoms of the two dancing-masters, who soon appear,
each abusing the other vigorously, and claiming for himself the
pre-eminence in their art. It is agreed that each shall exhibit his
best pupil before the king, Queen Dharini, and the learned Buddhist
nun, Kaushiki. The nun, who is in the secret of the king's desire, is
made mistress of ceremonies, and the queen's jealous opposition is
overborne.</p><br>
<br>
<p>
<b>ACT II</b>.The scene is laid in the concert-hall of the palace. The nun
determines that Ganadasa shall present his pupil first. Malavika is
thereupon introduced, dances, and sings a song which pretty plainly
indicates her own love for the king. He is in turn quite ravished,
finding her far more beautiful even than the picture. The clown
manages to detain her some little time by starting a discussion as to
her art, and when she is finally permitted to depart, both she and the
king are deeply in love. The court poet announces the noon hour, and
the exhibition of the other dancing-master is postponed.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT III</b>.The scene is laid in the palace garden. From the
conversation of two maids it appears that a favourite ashoka-tree is
late in blossoming. This kind of tree, so the belief runs, can be
induced to put forth blossoms if touched by the foot of a beautiful
woman in splendid garments.</p><br>
<p>
When the girls depart, the king enters with the clown, his confidant.
The clown, after listening to the king's lovelorn confidences, reminds
him that he has agreed to meet his young Queen Iravati in the garden,
and swing with her. But before the queen's arrival, Malavika enters,
sent thither by Dharini to touch the ashoka-tree with her foot, and
thus encourage it to blossom. The king and the clown hide in a
thicket, to feast their eyes upon her. Presently the maid Bakulavalika
appears, to adorn Malavika for the ceremony, and engages her in
conversation about the king. But now a third pair enter, the young
Queen Iravati, somewhat flushed with wine, and her maid Nipunika. They
also conceal themselves to spy upon the young girls. Thus there are
three groups upon the stage: the two girls believe themselves to be
alone; the king and the clown are aware of the two girls, as are also
the queen and her maid; but neither of these two pairs knows of the
presence of the other. This situation gives rise to very entertaining
dialogue, which changes its character when the king starts forward
to express his love for Malavika. Another sudden change is brought
about when Iravati, mad with jealousy, joins the group, sends the two
girls away, and berates the king. He excuses himself as earnestly as a
man may when caught in such a predicament, but cannot appease the
young queen, who leaves him with words of bitter jealousy.</p><br>
<br>
<p>
<b>ACT IV</b>.The clown informs the king that Queen Dharini has locked
Malavika and her friend in the cellar, and has given orders to the
doorkeeper that they are to be released only upon presentation of her
own signet-ring, engraved with the figure of a serpent. But he
declares that he has devised a plan to set them free. He bids the king
wait upon Queen Dharini, and presently rushes into their presence,
showing his thumb marked with two scratches, and declaring that he has
been bitten by a cobra. Imploring the king to care for his childless
mother, he awakens genuine sympathy in the queen, who readily parts
with her serpent-ring, supposed to be efficacious in charming away the
effects of snake-poison. Needless to say, he uses the ring to procure
the freedom of Malavika and her friend, and then brings about a
meeting with Agnimitra in the summer-house. The love-scene which
follows is again interrupted by Queen Iravati. This time the king is
saved by the news that his little daughter has been frightened by a
yellow monkey, and will be comforted only by him. The act ends with
the announcement that the ashoka-tree has blossomed.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT V</b>.It now appears that Queen Dharini has relented and is willing
to unite Malavika with the king; for she invites him to meet her under
the ashoka-tree, and includes Malavika among her attendants. Word is
brought that the army despatched against the king of Vidarbha has been
completely successful, and that in the spoil are included two maids
with remarkable powers of song. These maids are brought before the
company gathered at the tree, where they surprise every one by falling
on their faces before Malavika with the exclamation, "Our princess!"
Here the Buddhist nun takes up the tale. She tells how her brother,
the counsellor of the captive prince, had rescued her and Malavika
from the king of Vidarbha, and had started for Agnimitra's court.</p><br>
<p>
On the way they had been overpowered by robbers, her brother killed,
and she herself separated from Malavika. She had thereupon become a
nun and made her way to Agnimitra's court, and had there found
Malavika, who had been taken from the robbers by Agnimitra's general
and sent as a present to Queen Dharini. She had not divulged the
matter sooner, because of a prophecy that Malavika should be a servant
for just one year before becoming a king's bride. This recital removes
any possible objection to a union of Malavika and Agnimitra. To
complete the king's happiness, there comes a letter announcing that
his son by Dharini has won a victory over a force of Greek cavalry,
and inviting the court to be present at the sacrifice which was to
follow the victory. Thus every one is made happy except the jealous
young Queen Iravati, now to be supplanted by Malavika; yet even she
consents, though somewhat ungraciously, to the arrangements made.</p><br>
<p>
Criticism of the large outlines of this plot would be quite unjust,
for it is completely conventional. In dozens of plays we have the same
story: the king who falls in love with a maid-servant, the jealousy of
his harem, the eventual discovery that the maid is of royal birth, and
the addition of another wife to a number already sufficiently large.
In writing a play of this kind, the poet frankly accepts the
conventions; his ingenuity is shown in the minor incidents, in stanzas
of poetical description, and in giving abundant opportunity for
graceful music and dancing. When the play is approached in this way,
it is easy to see the <i>griffe du lion</i> in this, the earliest work of
the greatest poet who ever sang repeatedly of love between man and
woman, troubled for a time but eventually happy. For though there is
in Agnimitra, as in all heroes of his type, something contemptible,
there is in Malavika a sweetness, a delicacy, a purity, that make her
no unworthy precursor of Sita, of Indumati, of the Yaksha's bride, and
of Shakuntala.</p><br>
<br>
<br>

<b>II."URVASHI"</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>The second of the two inferior dramas may be conveniently called
<i>Urvashi</i>, though the full title is <i>The Tale of Urvashi won by
Valour</i>. When and where the play was first produced we do not know,
for the prologue is silent as to these matters. It has been thought
that it was the last work of Kalidasa, even that it was never produced
in his lifetime. Some support is lent to this theory by the fact that
the play is filled with reminiscences of Shakuntala, in small matters
as well as in great; as if the poet's imagination had grown weary, and
he were willing to repeat himself. Yet <i>Urvashi</i> is a much more
ambitious effort than <i>Malavika</i>, and invites a fuller criticism,
after an outline of the plot has been given.</p><br>
<p>
In addition to the stage-director and his assistant, who appear in the
prologue, the characters of the play are these:</p><br>

<p>
<i>A charioteer, a chamberlain, a hermit-woman, various nymphs and other
divine beings, and attendants</i>.</p><br>
<p>
The scene shifts as indicated in the following analysis. The time of
the first four acts is a few days. Between acts four and five several
years elapse.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT I</b>.The prologue only tells us that we may expect a new play of
Kalidasa. A company of heavenly nymphs then appear upon Mount
Gold-peak wailing and calling for help. Their cries are answered by
King Pururavas, who rides in a chariot that flies through the air. In
response to his inquiries, the nymphs inform him that two of their
number, Urvashi and Chitralekha, have been carried into captivity by
a demon. The king darts in pursuit, and presently returns,
victorious, with the two nymphs. As soon as Urvashi recovers
consciousness, and has rejoined her joyful friends, it is made plain
that she and the king have been deeply impressed with each other's
attractions. The king is compelled to decline an invitation to visit
Paradise, but he and Urvashi exchange loving glances before they part.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT II</b>.The act opens with a comic scene in the king's palace. The
clown appears, bursting with the secret of the king's love for
Urvashi, which has been confided to him. He is joined by the maid
Nipunika, commissioned by the queen to discover what it is that
occupies the king's mind. She discovers the secret ingeniously, but
without much difficulty, and gleefully departs.</p><br>
<p>
The king and the clown then appear in the garden, and the king
expresses at some length the depth and seeming hopelessness of his
passion. The latter part of his lament is overheard by Urvashi
herself, who, impelled by love for the king, has come down to earth
with her friend Chitralekha, and now stands near, listening but
invisible. When she has heard enough to satisfy her of the king's
passion, she writes a love-stanza on a birch-leaf, and lets it fall
before him. His reception of this token is such that Urvashi throws
aside the magic veil that renders her invisible, but as soon as she
has greeted the king, she and her friend are called away to take their
parts in a play that is being presented in Paradise.</p><br>
<p>
The king and the clown hunt for Urvashi's love-letter, which has been
neglected during the past few minutes. But the leaf has blown away,
only to be picked up and read by Nipunika, who at that moment enters
with the queen. The queen can hardly be deceived by the lame excuses
which the king makes, and after offering her ironical congratulations,
jealously leaves him.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT III</b>.The act opens with a conversation between two minor
personages in Paradise. It appears that Urvashi had taken the
heroine's part in the drama just presented there, and when asked, "On
whom is your heart set" had absentmindedly replied, "On Pururavas."
Heaven's stage-director had thereupon cursed her to fall from
Paradise, but this curse had been thus modified: that she was to live
on earth with Pururavas until he should see a child born of her, and
was then to return.</p><br>
<p>
The scene shifts to Pururavas' palace. In the early evening, the
chamberlain brings the king a message, inviting him to meet the queen
on a balcony bathed in the light of the rising moon. The king betakes
himself thither with his friend, the clown. In the midst of a dialogue
concerning moonlight and love, Urvashi and Chitralekha enter from
Paradise, wearing as before veils of invisibility. Presently the queen
appears and with humble dignity asks pardon of the king for her
rudeness, adding that she will welcome any new queen whom he genuinely
loves and who genuinely returns his love. When the queen departs,
Urvashi creeps up behind the king and puts her hands over his eyes.
Chitralekha departs after begging the king to make her friend forget
Paradise.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT IV</b>.From a short dialogue in Paradise between Chitralekha and
another nymph, we learn that a misfortune has befallen Pururavas and
Urvashi. During their honeymoon in a delightful Himalayan forest,
Urvashi, in a fit of jealousy, had left her husband, and had
inadvertently entered a grove forbidden by an austere god to women.
She was straightway transformed into a vine, while Pururavas is
wandering through the forest in desolate anguish.</p><br>
<p>
The scene of what follows is laid in the Himalayan forest. Pururavas
enters, and in a long poetical soliloquy bewails his loss and seeks
for traces of Urvashi. He vainly asks help of the creatures whom he
meets: a peacock, a cuckoo, a swan, a ruddy goose, a bee, an elephant,
a mountain-echo, a river, and an antelope. At last he finds a
brilliant ruby in a cleft of the rocks, and when about to throw it
away, is told by a hermit to preserve it: for this is the gem of
reunion, and one who possesses it will soon be reunited with his love.
With the gem in his hand, Pururavas comes to a vine which mysteriously
reminds him of Urvashi, and when he embraces it, he finds his beloved
in his arms. After she has explained to him the reason of her
transformation, they determine to return to the king's capital.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>ACT V</b>.The scene of the concluding act is the king's palace. Several
years have passed in happy love, and Pururavas has only one
sorrowthat he is childless.</p><br>
<p>
One day a vulture snatches from a maid's hand the treasured gem of
reunion, which he takes to be a bit of bloody meat, and flies off with
it, escaping before he can be killed. While the king and his
companions lament the gem's loss, the chamberlain enters, bringing the
gem and an arrow with which the bird had been shot. On the arrow is
written a verse declaring it to be the property of Ayus, son of
Pururavas and Urvashi. A hermit-woman is then ushered in, who brings a
lad with her. She explains that the lad had been entrusted to her as
soon as born by Urvashi, and that it was he who had just shot the bird
and recovered the gem. When Urvashi is summoned to explain why she had
concealed her child, she reminds the king of heaven's decree that she
should return as soon as Pururavas should see the child to be born to
them. She had therefore sacrificed maternal love to conjugal
affection. Upon this, the king's new-found joy gives way to gloom. He
determines to give up his kingdom and spend the remainder of his life
as a hermit in the forest. But the situation is saved by a messenger
from Paradise, bearing heaven's decree that Urvashi shall live with
the king until his death. A troop of nymphs then enter and assist in
the solemn consecration of Ayus as crown prince.</p><br>
<p>
The tale of Pururavas and Urvashi, which Kalidasa has treated
dramatically, is first made known to us in the Rigveda. It is thus one
of the few tales that so caught the Hindu imagination as to survive
the profound change which came over Indian thinking in the passage
from Vedic to classical times. As might be expected from its history,
it is told in many widely differing forms, of which the oldest and
best may be summarised thus.</p><br>
<p>
Pururavas, a mortal, sees and loves the nymph Urvashi. She consents to
live with him on earth so long as he shall not break certain trivial
conditions. Some time after the birth of a son, these conditions are
broken, through no fault of the man, and she leaves him. He wanders
disconsolate, finds her, and pleads with her, by her duty as a wife,
by her love for her child, even by a threat of suicide. She rejects
his entreaties, declaring that there can be no lasting love between
mortal and immortal, even adding: "There are no friendships with
women. Their hearts are the hearts of hyenas." Though at last she
comforts him with vague hopes of a future happiness, the story
remains, as indeed it must remain, a tragedythe tragedy of love
between human and divine.</p><br>
<p>
This splendid tragic story Kalidasa has ruined. He has made of it an
ordinary tale of domestic intrigue, has changed the nymph of heaven
into a member of an earthly harem. The more important changes made by
Kalidasa in the traditional story, all have the tendency to remove the
massive, godlike, austere features of the tale, and to substitute
something graceful or even pretty. These principal changes are: the
introduction of the queen, the clown, and the whole human
paraphernalia of a court; the curse pronounced on Urvashi for her
carelessness in the heavenly drama, and its modification; the
invention of the gem of reunion; and the final removal of the curse,
even as modified. It is true that the Indian theatre permits no
tragedy, and we may well believe that no successor of Kalidasa could
hope to present a tragedy on the stage. But might not Kalidasa, far
overtopping his predecessors, have put on the stage a drama the story
of which was already familiar to his audience as a tragic story
Perhaps not. If not, one can but wish that he had chosen another
subject.</p><br>
<p>
This violent twisting of an essentially tragic story has had a further
ill consequence in weakening the individual characters. Pururavas is a
mere conventional hero, in no way different from fifty others, in
spite of his divine lineage and his successful wooing of a goddess.
Urvashi is too much of a nymph to be a woman, and too much of a woman
to be a nymph. The other characters are mere types.</p><br>
<p>
Yet, in spite of these obvious objections, Hindu critical opinion has
always rated the <i>Urvashi</i> very high, and I have long hesitated to
make adverse comments upon it, for it is surely true that every nation
is the best judge of its own literature. And indeed, if one could but
forget plot and characters, he would find in <i>Urvashi</i> much to attract
and charm. There is no lack of humour in the clever maid who worms the
clown's secret out of him. There is no lack of a certain shrewdness in
the clown, as when he observes:</p><br>
<p>
"Who wants heaven It is nothing to eat or drink. It is just a place
where they never shut their eyeslike fishes!"</p><br>
<p>
Again, the play offers an opportunity for charming scenic display. The
terrified nymphs gathered on the mountain, the palace balcony bathed
in moonlight, the forest through which the king wanders in search of
his lost darling, the concluding solemn consecration of the crown
prince by heavenly beingsthese scenes show that Kalidasa was no
closet dramatist. And finally, there is here and there such poetry as
only Kalidasa could write. The fourth act particularly, undramatic as
it is, is full of a delicate beauty that defies transcription. It was
a new and daring thoughtto present on the stage a long lyrical
monologue addressed to the creatures of the forest and inspired by
despairing passion. Nor must it be forgotten that this play, like all
Indian plays, is an opera. The music and the dancing are lost. We
judge it perforce unfairly, for we judge it by the text alone. If, in
spite of all, the <i>Urvashi</i> is a failure, it is a failure possible
only to a serene and mighty poet.</p><br>

<hr>
<h2>THE DYNASTY OF RAGHU</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> is an epic poem in nineteen cantos. It consists
of 1564 stanzas, or something over six thousand lines of verse. The
subject is that great line of kings who traced their origin to the
sun, the famous "solar line" of Indian story. The bright particular
star of the solar line is Rama, the knight without fear and without
reproach, the Indian ideal of a gentleman. His story had been told
long before Kalidasa's time in the <i>Ramayana</i>, an epic which does not
need to shun comparison with the foremost epic poems of Europe. In
<i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>, too, Rama is the central figure; yet in
Kalidasa's poem there is much detail concerning other princes of the
line. The poem thus naturally falls into three great parts: first, the
four immediate ancestors of Rama (cantos 1-9); second, Rama (cantos
10-15); third, certain descendants of Rama (cantos 16-19). A somewhat
detailed account of the matter of the poem may well precede criticism
and comment.</p><br>

<p>
<i>First canto. The journey to the hermitage</i>.The poem begins with the
customary brief prayer for Shiva's favour:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">

<span class="i2">To join fit meaning to my speech.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then follow nine stanzas in which Kalidasa speaks more directly of
himself than elsewhere in his works:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">How great is Raghu's solar line!<br></span>

</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
After the briefest glance at the origin of the solar line, the poet
tells of Rama's great-great-grandfather, King Dilipa. The detailed
description of Dilipa's virtues has interest as showing Kalidasa's
ideal of an aristocrat; a brief sample must suffice here:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">He practised virtue, though in health;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Won riches, with no greed for wealth;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Guarded his life, though not from fear;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Prized joys of earth, but not too dear.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class="i2">His virtuous foes he could esteem<br></span>
<span class="i2">Like bitter drugs that healing seem;<br></span>
<span class="i2">The friends who sinned he could forsake<br></span>
<span class="i2">Like fingers bitten by a snake.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yet King Dilipa has one deep-seated grief: he has no son. He therefore
journeys with his queen to the hermitage of the sage Vasishtha, in
order to learn what they must do to propitiate an offended fate. Their
chariot rolls over country roads past fragrant lotus-ponds and
screaming peacocks and trustful deer, under archways formed without
supporting pillars by the cranes, through villages where they receive
the blessings of the people. At sunset they reach the peaceful forest
hermitage, and are welcomed by the sage. In response to Vasishtha's
benevolent inquiries, the king declares that all goes well in the
kingdom, and yet:</p><br>

<p>
Vasishtha tells the king that on a former occasion he had offended the
divine cow Fragrant, and had been cursed by the cow to lack children
until he had propitiated her own offspring. While the sage is
speaking, Fragrant's daughter approaches, and is entrusted to the
care of the king and queen.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Second canto. The holy cow's gift</i>.During twenty-one days the king
accompanies the cow during her wanderings in the forest, and each
night the queen welcomes their return to the hermitage. On the
twenty-second day the cow is attacked by a lion, and when the king
hastens to draw an arrow, his arm is magically numbed, so that he
stands helpless. To increase his horror, the lion speaks with a human
voice, saying that he is a servant of the god Shiva, set on guard
there and eating as his appointed food any animals that may appear.
Dilipa perceives that a struggle with earthly weapons is useless, and
begs the lion to accept his own body as the price of the cow's
release. The lion tries sophistry, using the old, hollow arguments:</p><br>

<p>

Dilipa has no trouble in piercing this sophistical argument, and again
offers his own life, begging the lion to spare the body of his fame
rather than the body of his flesh. The lion consents, but when the
king resolutely presents himself to be eaten, the illusion vanishes,
and the holy cow grants the king his desire. The king returns to his
capital with the queen, who shortly becomes pregnant.</p><br>
<p>

This happy childhood is followed by a youth equally happy. Raghu is
married and made crown prince. He is entrusted with the care of the
horse of sacrifice,
1
and when Indra, king of the gods, steals the
horse, Raghu fights him. He cannot overcome the king of heaven, yet he
acquits himself so creditably that he wins Indra's friendship. In
consequence of this proof of his manhood, the empire is bestowed upon
Raghu by his father, who retires with his queen to the forest, to
spend his last days and prepare for death.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Fourth canto. Raghu conquers the world</i>.The canto opens with
several stanzas descriptive of the glory of youthful King Raghu.</p><br>

<p>
Raghu therefore determines to make a warlike progress through all
India. He marches eastward with his army from his capital Ayodhya (the
name is preserved in the modern Oudh) to the Bay of Bengal, then
south along the eastern shore of India to Cape Comorin, then north
along the western shore until he comes to the region drained by the
Indus, finally east through the tremendous Himalaya range into Assam,
and thence home. The various nations whom he encounters, Hindus,
Persians, Greeks, and White Huns, all submit either with or without
fighting. On his safe return, Raghu offers a great sacrifice and gives
away all his wealth.

</p><br>
<p>

<i>Fifth canto. Aja goes wooing</i>.While King Raghu is penniless, a
young sage comes to him, desiring a huge sum of money to give to the
teacher with whom he has just finished his education. The king,
unwilling that any suppliant should go away unsatisfied, prepares to
assail the god of wealth in his Himalayan stronghold, and the god,
rather than risk the combat, sends a rain of gold into the king's
treasury. This gold King Raghu bestows upon the sage, who gratefully
uses his spiritual power to cause a son to be born to his benefactor.
In course of time, the son is born and the name Aja is given to him.
We are here introduced to Prince Aja, who is a kind of secondary hero
in the poem, inferior only to his mighty grandson, Rama. To Aja are
devoted the remainder of this fifth canto and the following three
cantos; and these Aja-cantos are among the loveliest in the epic. When
the prince has grown into young manhood, he journeys to a neighbouring
court to participate in the marriage reception of Princess
Indumati.
3

One evening he camps by a river, from which a wild
elephant issues and attacks his party. When wounded by Aja, the
elephant strangely changes his form, becoming a demigod, gives the
prince a magic weapon, and departs to heaven. Aja proceeds ceeds
without further adventure to the country and the palace of Princess
Indumati, where he is made welcome and luxuriously lodged for the
night. In the morning, he is awakened by the song of the court poets
outside his chamber. He rises and betakes himself to the hall where
the suitors are gathering.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Sixth canto. The princess chooses</i>.The princely suitors assemble in
the hall; then, to the sound of music, the princess enters in a
litter, robed as a bride, and creates a profound sensation.</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">For when they saw God's masterpiece, the maid<br></span>
<span class="i4">Who smote their eyes to other objects blind,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Their glances, wishes, hearts, in homage paid,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Flew forth to her; mere flesh remained behind.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class="i2">The princes could not but betray their yearning<br></span>
<span class="i4">By sending messengers, their love to bring,<br></span>
<span class="i2">In many a quick, involuntary turning,<br></span>
<span class="i4">As flowering twigs of trees announce the spring.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then a maid-servant conducts the princess from one suitor to another,
and explains the claim which each has upon her affection. First is
presented the King of Magadha, recommended in four stanzas, one of
which runs:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">Though other kings by thousands numbered be,<br></span>
<span class="i4">He seems the one, sole governor of earth;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Stars, constellations, planets, fade and flee<br></span>
<span class="i4">When to the moon the night has given birth.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the princess is not attracted.</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">The slender maiden glanced at him; she glanced<br></span>
<span class="i4">And uttered not a word, nor heeded how<br></span>
<span class="i2">The grass-twined blossoms of her garland danced<br></span>
<span class="i4">When she dismissed him with a formal bow.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
They pass to the next candidate, the king of the Anga country, in
whose behalf this, and more, is said:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">Learning and wealth by nature are at strife,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Yet dwell at peace in him; and for the two<br></span>
<span class="i2">You would be fit companion as his wife,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Like wealth enticing, and like learning true.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Him too the princess rejects, "not that he was unworthy of love, or
she lacking in discernment, but tastes differ." She is then conducted
to the King of Avanti:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">And if this youthful prince your fancy pleases,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Bewitching maiden, you and he may play<br></span>
<span class="i2">In those unmeasured gardens that the breezes<br></span>
<span class="i4">From Sipra's billows ruffle, cool with spray.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
The inducement is insufficient, and a new candidate is presented, the
King of Anupa,</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">A prince whose fathers' glories cannot fade,<br></span>
<span class="i4">By whom the love of learned men is wooed,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Who proves that Fortune is no fickle jade<br></span>
<span class="i4">When he she chooses is not fickly good.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
But alas!</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">She saw that he was brave to look upon,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Yet could not feel his love would make her gay;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Full moons of autumn nights, when clouds are gone,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Tempt not the lotus-flowers that bloom by day.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
The King of Shurasena has no better fortune, in spite of his virtues
and his wealth. As a river hurrying to the sea passes by a mountain
that would detain her, so the princess passes him by. She is next
introduced to the king of the Kalinga country;</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">His palace overlooks the ocean dark<br></span>
<span class="i4">With windows gazing on the unresting deep,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Whose gentle thunders drown the drums that mark<br></span>
<span class="i4">The hours of night, and wake him from his sleep.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the maiden can no more feel at home with him than the goddess of
fortune can with a good but unlucky man. She therefore turns her
attention to the king of the Pandya country in far southern India. But
she is unmoved by hearing of the magic charm of the south, and rejects
him too.</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">And every prince rejected while she sought<br></span>
<span class="i4">A husband, darkly frowned, as turrets, bright<br></span>
<span class="i2">One moment with the flame from torches caught,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Frown gloomily again and sink in night.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
The princess then approaches Aja, who trembles lest she pass him by,
as she has passed by the other suitors. The maid who accompanies
Indumati sees that Aja awakens a deeper feeling, and she therefore
gives a longer account of his kingly line, ending with the
recommendation:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">High lineage is his, fresh beauty, youth,<br></span>
<span class="i4">And virtue shaped in kingly breeding's mould;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Choose him, for he is worth your love; in truth,<br></span>
<span class="i4">A gem is ever fitly set in gold.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
The princess looks lovingly at the handsome youth, but cannot speak
for modesty. She is made to understand her own feelings when the maid
invites her to pass on to the next candidate. Then the wreath is
placed round Aja's neck, the people of the city shout their approval,
and the disappointed suitors feel like night-blooming lotuses at
daybreak.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Seventh canto. Aja's marriage</i>.While the suitors retire to the
camps where they have left their retainers, Aja conducts Indumati into
the decorated and festive city. The windows are filled with the faces
of eager and excited women, who admire the beauty of the young prince
and the wisdom of the princess's choice. When the marriage ceremony
has been happily celebrated, the disappointed suitors say farewell
with pleasant faces and jealous hearts, like peaceful pools concealing
crocodiles. They lie in ambush on the road which he must take, and
when he passes with his young bride, they fall upon him. Aja provides
for the safety of Indumati, marshals his attendants, and greatly
distinguishes himself in the battle which follows. Finally he uses the
magic weapon, given him by the demigod, to benumb his adversaries,
and leaving them in this helpless condition, returns home. He and his
young bride are joyfully welcomed by King Raghu, who resigns the
kingdom in favour of Aja.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Eighth canto. Aja's lament</i>.As soon as King Aja is firmly
established on his throne, Raghu retires to a hermitage to prepare for
the death of his mortal part. After some years of religious meditation
he is released, attaining union with the eternal spirit which is
beyond all darkness. His obsequies are performed by his dutiful son.
Indumati gives birth to a splendid boy, who is named Dasharatha. One
day, as the queen is playing with her husband in the garden, a wreath
of magic flowers falls upon her from heaven, and she dies. The
stricken king clasps the body of his dead beloved, and laments over
her.</p><br>

Aja commits the body of his beloved queen to the flames. A holy hermit
comes to tell the king that his wife had been a nymph of heaven in a
former existence, and that she has now returned to her home. But Aja
cannot be comforted. He lives eight weary years for the sake of his
young son, then is reunited with his queen in Paradise.</p><br>

father of the heroic Rama. It begins with an elaborate description of
his glory, justice, prowess, and piety; then tells of the three
princesses who became his wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. In
the beautiful springtime he takes an extended hunting-trip in the
forest, during which an accident happens, big with fate.</p><br>

<p>
Thus is foreshadowed in the birth of Rama, his banishment, and the
death of his father.</p><br>
<p>
Cantos ten to fifteen form the kernel of the epic, for they tell the
story of Rama, the mighty hero of Raghu's line. In these cantos
Kalidasa attempts to present anew, with all the literary devices of a
more sophisticated age, the famous old epic story sung in masterly
fashion by the author of the <i>Ramayana</i>. As the poet is treading
ground familiar to all who hear him, the action of these cantos is
very compressed.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Tenth canto. The incarnation of Rama</i>.While Dasharatha, desiring a
son, is childless, the gods, oppressed by a giant adversary, betake
themselves to Vishnu, seeking aid. They sing a hymn of praise, a part
of which is given here.</p><br>

Vishnu is gratified by the praise of the gods, and asks their desire.
They inform him that they are distressed by Ravana, the giant king of
Lanka (Ceylon), whom they cannot conquer. Vishnu promises to aid them
by descending to earth in a new avatar, as son of Dasharatha. Shortly
afterwards, an angel appears before King Dasharatha, bringing in a
golden bowl a substance which contains the essence of Vishnu. The king
gives it to his three wives, who thereupon conceive and dream
wonderful dreams. Then Queen Kausalya gives birth to Rama; Queen
Kaikeyi to Bharata; Queen Sumitra to twins, Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
Heaven and earth rejoice. The four princes grow up in mutual
friendship, yet Rama and Lakshmana are peculiarly drawn to each
other, as are Bharata and Shatrughna. So beautiful and so modest are
the four boys that they seem like incarnations of the four things
worth living forvirtue, money, love, and salvation.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Eleventh canto. The victory over Rama-with-the-axe</i>.At the request
of the holy hermit Vishvamitra, the two youths Rama and Lakshmana
visit his hermitage, to protect it from evil spirits. The two lads
little suspect, on their maiden journey, how much of their lives will
be spent in wandering together in the forest. On the way they are
attacked by a giantess, whom Rama kills; the first of many giants who
are to fall at his hand. He is given magic weapons by the hermit, with
which he and his brother kill other giants, freeing the hermitage from
all annoyance. The two brothers then travel with the hermit to the
city of Mithila, attracted thither by hearing of its king, his
wonderful daughter, and his wonderful bow. The bow was given him by
the god Shiva; no man has been able to bend it; and the beautiful
princess's hand is the prize of any man who can perform the feat. On
the way thither, Rama brings to life Ahalya, a woman who in a former
age had been changed to stone for unfaithfulness to her austere
husband, and had been condemned to remain a stone until trodden by
Rama's foot. Without further adventure, they reach Mithila, where the
hermit presents Rama as a candidate for the bending of the bow.</p><br>

<p>

Yet when the bow is given to the youthful Rama, he not only bends, but
breaks it. He is immediately rewarded with the hand of the Princess
Sita, while Lakshmana marries her sister. On their journey home with
their young brides, dreadful portents appear, followed by their cause,
a strange being called Rama-with-the-axe, who is carefully to be
distinguished from Prince Rama. This Rama-with-the-axe is a Brahman
who has sworn to exterminate the entire warrior caste, and who
naturally attacks the valorous prince. He makes light of Rama's
achievement in breaking Shiva's bow, and challenges him to bend the
mightier bow which he carries. This the prince succeeds in doing, and
Rama-with-the-axe disappears, shamed and defeated. The marriage party
then continues its journey to Ayodhya.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Twelfth canto. The killing of Ravana</i>.King Dasharatha prepares to
anoint Rama crown prince, when Queen Kaikeyi interposes. On an earlier
occasion she had rendered the king a service and received his promise
that he would grant her two boons, whatever she desired. She now
demands her two boons: the banishment of Rama for fourteen years, and
the anointing of her own son Bharata as crown prince. Rama thereupon
sets out for the Dandaka forest in Southern India, accompanied by his
faithful wife Sita and his devoted brother Lakshmana. The stricken
father dies of grief, thus fulfilling the hermit's curse. Now Prince
Bharata proves himself more generous than his mother; he refuses the
kingdom, and is with great difficulty persuaded by Rama himself to act
as regent during the fourteen years. Even so, he refuses to enter the
capital city, dwelling in a village outside the walls, and preserving
Rama's slippers as a symbol of the rightful king. Meanwhile Rama's
little party penetrates the wild forests of the south, fighting as
need arises with the giants there. Unfortunately, a giantess falls in
love with Rama, and</p><br>

Scorned by Rama, laughed at by Sita, she becomes furious and

<p>
Lakshmana thereupon cuts off her nose and ears, rendering her
redundantly hideous. She departs, to return presently at the head of
an army of giants, whom Rama defeats single-handed, while his brother
guards Sita. The giantess then betakes herself to her brother, the
terrible ten-headed Ravana, king of Ceylon. He succeeds in capturing
Sita by a trick, and carries her off to his fortress in Ceylon. It is
plainly necessary for Rama to seek allies before attempting to cross
the straits and attack the stronghold. He therefore renders an
important service to the monkey king Sugriva, who gratefully leads an
army of monkeys to his assistance. The most valiant of these, Hanumat,
succeeds in entering Ravana's capital, where he finds Sita, gives her
a token from Rama, and receives a token for Rama. The army thereupon
sets out and comes to the seashore, where it is reinforced by the
giant Vibhishana, who has deserted his wicked brother Ravana. The
monkeys hurl great boulders into the strait, thus forming a bridge
over which they cross into Ceylon and besiege Ravana's capital. There
ensue many battles between the giants and the monkeys, culminating in
a tremendous duel between the champions, Rama and Ravana. In this duel
Ravana is finally slain. Rama recovers his wife, and the principal
personages of the army enter the flying chariot which had belonged to
Ravana, to return to Ayodhya; for the fourteen years of exile are now
over.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Thirteenth canto. The return from the forest</i>.This canto describes
the long journey through the air from Ceylon over the whole length of
India to Ayodhya. As the celestial car makes its journey, Rama points
out the objects of interest or of memory to Sita. Thus, as they fly
over the sea:</p><br>

wife:</p><br>

</blockquote>
<p>
 Rama then points out the spots in Southern India where he and Sita
had dwelt in exile, and the pious hermitages which they had visited;
later, the holy spot where the Jumna River joins the Ganges; finally,
their distant home, unseen for fourteen years, and the well-known
river, from which spray-laden breezes come to them like cool,
welcoming hands. When they draw near, Prince Bharata comes forth to
welcome them, and the happy procession approaches the capital city.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Fourteenth canto. Sita is put away</i>.The exiles are welcomed by
Queen Kausalya and Queen Sumitra with a joy tinged with deep
melancholy. After the long-deferred anointing of Rama as king, comes
the triumphal entry into the ancestral capital, where Rama begins his
virtuous reign with his beloved queen most happily; for the very
hardships endured in the forest turn into pleasures when remembered in
the palace. To crown the king's joy, Sita becomes pregnant, and
expresses a wish to visit the forest again. At this point, where an
ordinary story would end, comes the great tragedy, the tremendous test
of Rama's character. The people begin to murmur about the queen,
believing that she could not have preserved her purity in the giant's
palace. Rama knows that she is innocent, but he also knows that he
cannot be a good king while the people feel as they do; and after a
pitiful struggle, he decides to put away his beloved wife. He bids his
brother Lakshmana take her to the forest, in accordance with her
request, but to leave her there at the hermitage of the sage Valmiki.
When this is done, and Sita hears the terrible future from Lakshmana,
she cries:</p><br>

<p>
While she laments thus piteously, she is discovered by the poet-sage
Valmiki, who consoles her with tender and beautiful words, and
conducts her to his hermitage, where she awaits the time of her
confinement. Meanwhile Rama leads a dreary life, finding duty but a
cold comforter. He makes a golden statue of his wife, and will not
look at other women.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Fifteenth canto. Rama goes to heaven</i>.The canto opens with a rather
long description of a fight between Rama's youngest brother and a
giant. On the journey to meet the giant, Shatrughna spends a night
in Valmiki's hermitage, and that very night Sita gives birth to twin
sons. Valmiki gives them the names Kusha and Lava, and when they grow
out of childhood he teaches them his own composition, the <i>Ramayana</i>,
"the sweet story of Rama," "the first path shown to poets." At this
time the young son of a Brahman dies in the capital, and the father
laments at the king's gate, for he believes that the king is unworthy,
else heaven would not send death prematurely. Rama is roused to stamp
out evil-doing in the kingdom, whereupon the dead boy comes to life.
The king then feels that his task on earth is nearly done, and
prepares to celebrate the great horse-sacrifice.
4
At this sacrifice
appear the two youths Kusha and Lava, who sing the epic of Rama's
deeds in the presence of Rama himself. The father perceives their
likeness to himself, then learns that they are indeed his children,
whom he has never seen. Thereupon Sita is brought forward by the
poet-sage Valmiki and in the presence of her husband and her
detractors establishes her constant purity in a terrible fashion.</p><br>

<p>
Rama then establishes his brothers, sons, and nephews in different
cities of the kingdom, buries the three queens of his father, and
awaits death. He has not long to wait; Death comes, wearing a hermit's
garb, asks for a private interview, and threatens any who shall
disturb their conference. Lakshmana disturbs them, and so dies before
Rama. Then Rama is translated.</p><br>

Cantos sixteen to nineteen form the third division of the epic, and
treat of Rama's descendants. The interest wanes, for the great hero is
gone.</p><br>

<i>Sixteenth canto. Kumudvati's wedding</i>.As Kusha lies awake one
night, a female figure appears in his chamber; and in answer to his
question, declares that she is the presiding goddess of the ancient
capital Ayodhya, which has been deserted since Rama's departure to
heaven. She pictures the sad state of the city thus:</p><br>

The goddess therefore begs Kusha to return with his court to the old
capital, and when he assents, she smiles and vanishes. The next
morning Kusha announces the vision of the night, and immediately sets
out for Ayodhya with his whole army. Arrived there, King Kusha quickly
restores the city to its former splendour. Then when the hot summer
comes, the king goes down to the river to bathe with the ladies of the
court. While in the water he loses a great gem which his father had
given him. The divers are unable to find it, and declare their belief
that it has been stolen by the serpent Kumuda who lives in the river.
The king threatens to shoot an arrow into the river, whereupon the
waters divide, and the serpent appears with the gem. He is accompanied
by a beautiful maiden, whom he introduces as his sister Kumudvati, and
whom he offers in marriage to Kusha. The offer is accepted, and the
wedding celebrated with great pomp.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Seventeenth canto. King Atithi</i>.To the king and queen is born a
son, who is named Atithi. When he has grown into manhood, his father
Kusha engages in a struggle with a demon, in which the king is killed
in the act of killing his adversary. He goes to heaven, followed by
his faithful queen, and Atithi is anointed king. The remainder of the
canto describes King Atithi's glorious reign.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Eighteenth canto. The later princes</i>.This canto gives a brief,
impressionistic sketch of the twenty-one kings who in their order
succeeded Atithi.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Nineteenth canto. The loves of Agnivarna</i>.After the twenty-one
kings just mentioned, there succeeds a king named Agnivarna, who gives
himself to dissipation. He shuts himself up in the palace; even when
duty requires him to appear before his subjects, he does so merely by
hanging one foot out of a window. He trains dancing-girls himself, and
has so many mistresses that he cannot always call them by their right
names. It is not wonderful that this kind of life leads before long to
a consuming disease; and as Agnivarna is even then unable to resist
the pleasures of the senses, he dies. His queen is pregnant, and she
mounts the throne as regent in behalf of her unborn son. With this
strange scene, half tragic, half vulgar, the epic, in the form in
which it has come down to us, abruptly ends.</p><br>
<p>
If we now endeavour to form some critical estimate of the poem, we are
met at the outset by this strangely unnatural termination. We cannot
avoid wondering whether the poem as we have it is complete. And we
shall find that there are good reasons for believing that Kalidasa did
not let the glorious solar line end in the person of the voluptuous
Agnivarna and his unborn child. In the first place, there is a
constant tradition which affirms that <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>
originally consisted of twenty-five cantos. A similar tradition
concerning Kalidasa's second epic has justified itself; for some time
only seven cantos were known; then more were discovered, and we now
have seventeen. Again, there is a rhetorical rule, almost never
disregarded, which requires a literary work to end with an epilogue in
the form of a little prayer for the welfare of readers or auditors.
Kalidasa himself complies with this rule, certainly in five of his
other six books. Once again, Kalidasa has nothing of the tragedian in
his soul; his works, without exception, end happily. In the drama
<i>Urvashi</i> he seriously injures a splendid old tragic story for the
sake of a happy ending. These facts all point to the probability that
the conclusion of the epic has been lost. We may even assign a
natural, though conjectural, reason for this. <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>
has been used for centuries as a text-book in India, so that
manuscripts abound, and commentaries are very numerous. Now if the
concluding cantos were unfitted for use as a text-book, they might
very easily be lost during the centuries before the introduction of
printing-presses into India. Indeed, this very unfitness for use as a
school text seems to be the explanation of the temporary loss of
several cantos of Kalidasa's second epic.</p><br>
<p>
On the other hand, we are met by the fact that numerous commentators,
living in different parts of India, know the text of only nineteen
cantos. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Kalidasa left the poem
incomplete at his death; for it was, without serious question, one of
his earlier works. Apart from evidences of style, there is the
subject-matter of the introductory stanzas, in which the poet presents
himself as an aspirant for literary fame. No writer of established
reputation would be likely to say:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">The fool who seeks a poet's fame,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Must look for ridicule and blame,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Like tiptoe dwarf who fain would try<br></span>
<span class="i2">To pluck the fruit for giants high.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
In only one other of his writings, in the drama which was undoubtedly
written earlier than the other two dramas, does the poet thus present
his feeling of diffidence to his auditors.</p><br>
<p>
It is of course possible that Kalidasa wrote the first nineteen cantos
when a young man, intending to add more, then turned to other matters,
and never afterwards cared to take up the rather thankless task of
ending a youthful work.</p><br>
<p>
The question does not admit of final solution. Yet whoever reads and
re-reads <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>, and the other works of its author,
finds the conviction growing ever stronger that our poem in nineteen
cantos is mutilated. We are thus enabled to clear the author of the
charge of a lame and impotent conclusion.</p><br>
<p>
Another adverse criticism cannot so readily be disposed of; that of a
lack of unity in the plot. As the poem treats of a kingly dynasty, we
frequently meet the cry: The king is dead. Long live the king! The
story of Rama himself occupies only six cantos; he is not born until
the tenth canto, he is in heaven after the fifteenth. There are in
truth six heroes, each of whom has to die to make room for his
successor. One may go farther and say that it is not possible to give
a brief and accurate title to the poem. It is not a <i>Ramayana</i>, or
epic of Rama's deeds, for Rama is on the stage during only a third of
the poem. It is not properly an epic of Raghu's line, for many kings
of this line are unmentioned. Not merely kings who escape notice by
their obscurity, but also several who fill a large place in Indian
story, whose deeds and adventures are splendidly worthy of epic
treatment. <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> is rather an epic poem in which Rama
is the central figure, giving it such unity as it possesses, but which
provides Rama with a most generous background in the shape of selected
episodes concerning his ancestors and his descendants.</p><br>
<p>
Rama is the central figure. Take him away and the poem falls to pieces
like a pearl necklace with a broken string. Yet it may well be doubted
whether the cantos dealing with Rama are the most successful. They are
too compressed, too briefly allusive. Kalidasa attempts to tell the
story in about one-thirtieth of the space given to it by his great
predecessor Valmiki. The result is much loss by omission and much loss
by compression. Many of the best episodes of the <i>Ramayana</i> are quite
omitted by Kalidasa: for example, the story of the jealous humpback
who eggs on Queen Kaikeyi to demand her two boons; the beautiful scene
in which Sita insists on following Rama into the forest; the account
of the somnolent giant Pot-ear, a character quite as good as
Polyphemus. Other fine episodes are so briefly alluded to as to lose
all their charm: for example, the story of the golden deer that
attracts the attention of Rama while Ravana is stealing his wife; the
journey of the monkey Hanumat to Ravana's fortress and his interview
with Sita.</p><br>
<p>
The Rama-story, as told by Valmiki, is one of the great epic stories
of the world. It has been for two thousand years and more the story
<i>par excellence</i> of the Hindus; and the Hindus may fairly claim to be
the best story-tellers of the world. There is therefore real matter
for regret in the fact that so great a poet as Kalidasa should have
treated it in a way not quite worthy of it and of himself. The reason
is not far to seek, nor can there be any reasonable doubt as to its
truth. Kalidasa did not care to put himself into direct competition
with Valmiki. The younger poet's admiration of his mighty predecessor
is clearly expressed. It is with especial reference to Valmiki that he
says in his introduction:</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>

<span class="i2">Yet I may enter through the door<br></span>
<span class="i2">That mightier poets pierced of yore;<br></span>
<span class="i2">A thread may pierce a jewel, but<br></span>
<span class="i2">Must follow where the diamond cut.<br></span>
</p><br></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
He introduces Valmiki into his own epic, making him compose the
<i>Ramayana</i> in Rama's lifetime. Kalidasa speaks of Valmiki as "the
poet," and the great epic he calls "the sweet story of Rama," "the
first path shown to poets," which, when sung by the two boys, was
heard with motionless delight by the deer, and, when sung before a
gathering of learned men, made them heedless of the tears that rolled
down their cheeks.</p><br>
<p>
Bearing these matters in mind, we can see the course of Kalidasa's
thoughts almost as clearly as if he had expressed them directly. He
was irresistibly driven to write the wonderful story of Rama, as any
poet would be who became familiar with it. At the same time, his
modesty prevented him from challenging the old epic directly. He
therefore writes a poem which shall appeal to the hallowed
association that cluster round the great name of Rama, but devotes
two-thirds of it to themes that permit him greater freedom. The result
is a formless plot.</p><br>
<p>
This is a real weakness, yet not a fatal weakness. In general,
literary critics lay far too much emphasis on plot. Of the elements
that make a great book, two, style and presentation of character,
hardly permit critical analysis. The third, plot, does permit such
analysis. Therefore the analyst overrates its importance. It is fatal
to all claim of greatness in a narrative if it is shown to have a bad
style or to be without interesting characters. It is not fatal if it
is shown that the plot is rambling. In recent literature it is easy to
find truly great narratives in which the plot leaves much to be
desired. We may cite the <i>Pickwick Papers, Les Misrables, War
and Peace</i>.</p><br>
<p>
We must then regard <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> as a poem in which single
episodes take a stronger hold upon the reader than does the unfolding
of an ingenious plot. In some degree, this is true of all long poems.
The <i>neid</i> itself, the most perfect long poem ever written, has
dull passages. And when this allowance is made, what wonderful
passages we have in Kalidasa's poem! One hardly knows which of them
makes the strongest appeal, so many are they and so varied. There is
the description of the small boy Raghu in the third canto, the choice
of the princess in the sixth, the lament of King Aja in the eighth,
the story of Dasharatha and the hermit youth in the ninth, the account
of the ruined city in the sixteenth. Besides these, the Rama cantos,
ten to fifteen, make an epic within an epic. And if Kalidasa is not
seen at his very best here, yet his second best is of a higher quality
than the best of others. Also, the Rama story is so moving that a mere
allusion to it stirs like a sentimental memory of childhood. It has
the usual qualities of a good epic story: abundance of travel and
fighting and adventure and magic interweaving of human with
superhuman, but it has more than this. In both hero and heroine there
is real development of character. Odysseus and neas do not
grow; they go through adventures. But King Rama, torn between love for
his wife and duty to his subjects, is almost a different person from
the handsome, light-hearted prince who won his bride by breaking
Shiva's bow. Sita, faithful to the husband who rejects her, has made
a long, character-forming journey since the day when she left her
father's palace, a youthful bride. Herein lies the unique beauty of
the tale of Rama, that it unites romantic love and moral conflict with
a splendid story of wild adventure. No wonder that the Hindus,
connoisseurs of story-telling, have loved the tale of Rama's deeds
better than any other story.</p><br>
<p>
If we compare <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> with Kalidasa's other books, we
find it inferior to <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> in unity of plot,
inferior to <i>Shakuntala</i> in sustained interest, inferior to <i>The
Cloud-Messenger</i> in perfection of every detail. Yet passages in it are
as high and sweet as anything in these works. And over it is shed the
magic charm of Kalidasa's style. Of that it is vain to speak. It can
be had only at first hand. The final proof that <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>
is a very great poem, is this: no one who once reads it can leave it
alone thereafter.</p><br>

<h2>THE BIRTH OF THE WAR-GOD</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<br>


<p>
<i>The Birth of the War-god</i> is an epic poem in seventeen cantos. It
consists of 1096 stanzas, or about 4400 lines of verse. The subject is
the marriage of the god Shiva, the birth of his son, and the victory
of this son over a powerful demon. The story was not invented by
Kalidasa, but taken from old mythology. Yet it had never been told in
so masterly a fashion as had been the story of Rama's deeds by
Valmiki. Kalidasa is therefore under less constraint in writing this
epic than in writing <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>. I give first a somewhat
detailed analysis of the matter of the poem.</p><br>
<p>
<i>First canto. The birth of Parvati</i>.The poem begins with a
description of the great Himalaya mountain-range.</p><br>

It is predicted by a heavenly being that she will one day become the
wife of the god Shiva. This prediction awakens her father's pride, and
also his impatience, since Shiva makes no advances. For the destined
bridegroom is at this time leading a life of stern austerity and
self-denial upon a mountain peak. Himalaya therefore bids his daughter
wait upon Shiva. She does so, but without being able to divert him
from his austerities.</p><br>

Brahma receives their worship graciously, and asks the reason of their
coming. The spokesman of the gods explains to Brahma how a great demon
named Taraka is troubling the world, and how helpless they are in
opposing him. They have tried the most extravagant propitiation, and
found it useless.</p><br>

Brahma answers that the demon's power comes from him, and he does not
feel at liberty to proceed against it; "for it is not fitting to cut
down even a poison-tree that one's own hand has planted." But he
promises that a son shall be born to Shiva and Parvati, who shall lead
the gods to victory. With this answer the gods are perforce content,
and their king, Indra, waits upon the god of love, to secure his
necessary co-operation.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Third canto. The burning of Love</i>.Indra waits upon Love, who asks
for his commands. Indra explains the matter, and asks Love to inflame
Shiva with passion for Parvati. Love thereupon sets out, accompanied
by his wife Charm and his friend Spring. When they reach the mountain
where Shiva dwells, Spring shows his power. The snow disappears; the
trees put forth blossoms; bees, deer, and birds waken to new life. The
only living being that is not influenced by the sudden change of
season is Shiva, who continues his meditation, unmoved. Love himself
is discouraged, until he sees the beauty of Parvati, when he takes
heart again. At this moment, Shiva chances to relax his meditation,
and Parvati approaches to do him homage. Love seizes the lucky moment,
and prepares to shoot his bewildering arrow at Shiva. But the great
god sees him, and before the arrow is discharged, darts fire from his
eye, whereby Love is consumed. Charm falls in a swoon, Shiva vanishes,
and the wretched Parvati is carried away by her father.</p><br>

<i>Fifth canto. The reward of self-denial</i>.Parvati reproaches her own
beauty, for "loveliness is fruitless if it does not bind a lover." She
therefore resolves to lead a life of religious self-denial, hoping
that the merit thus acquired will procure her Shiva's love. Her mother
tries in vain to dissuade her; her father directs her to a fit
mountain peak, and she retires to her devotions. She lays aside all
ornaments, lets her hair hang unkempt, and assumes the hermit's dress
of bark. While she is spending her days in self-denial, she is visited
by a Brahman youth, who compliments her highly upon her rigid
devotion, and declares that her conduct proves the truth of the
proverb: Beauty can do no wrong. Yet he confesses himself bewildered,
for she seems to have everything that heart can desire. He therefore
asks her purpose in performing these austerities, and is told how her
desires are fixed upon the highest of all objects, upon the god Shiva
himself, and how, since Love is dead, she sees no way to win him
except by ascetic religion. The youth tries to dissuade Parvati by
recounting all the dreadful legends that are current about Shiva: how
he wears a coiling snake on his wrist, a bloody elephant-hide upon his
back, how he dwells in a graveyard, how he rides upon an undignified
bull, how poor he is and of unknown birth. Parvati's anger is awakened
by this recital. She frowns and her lip quivers as she defends herself
and the object of her love.</p><br>

<i>Sixth canto. Parvati is given in marriage</i>.While Parvati departs to
inform her father of what has happened, Shiva summons the seven sages,
who are to make the formal proposal of marriage to the bride's
parents. The seven sages appear, flying through the air, and with them
Arundhati, the heavenly model of wifely faith and devotion. On seeing
her, Shiva feels his eagerness for marriage increase, realising that</p><br>

<p>
Shiva then explains his purpose, and sends the seven sages to make the
formal request for Parvati's hand. The seven sages fly to the
brilliant city of Himalaya, where they are received by the mountain
god. After a rather portentous interchange of compliments, the seven
sages announce their errand, requesting Parvati's hand in behalf of
Shiva. The father joyfully assents, and it is agreed that the marriage
shall be celebrated after three days. These three days are spent by
Shiva in impatient longing.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Seventh canto. Parvati's wedding</i>.The three days are spent in
preparations for the wedding. So great is Parvati's unadorned beauty
that the waiting-women can hardly take their eyes from her to inspect
the wedding-dress. But the preparations are complete at last; and the
bride is beautiful indeed.</p><br>


<blockquote class="poem">

<span class="i4">Or white swans rest upon a river's shore,<br></span>

</p><br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Meanwhile Shiva finishes his preparations, and sets out on his wedding
journey, accompanied by Brahma, Vishnu, and lesser gods. At his
journey's end, he is received by his bride's father, and led through
streets ankle-deep in flowers, where the windows are filled with the
faces of eager and excited women, who gossip together thus:</p><br>

<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class="i2">For his sake it was well that Parvati<br></span>
<span class="i4">Should mortify her body delicate;<br></span>

<span class="i4">And infinitely blest his bosom's mate.<br></span>
</p><br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Shiva and his retinue then enter the palace, where he is received with
bashful love by Parvati, and the wedding is celebrated with due pomp.
The nymphs of heaven entertain the company with a play, and Shiva
restores the body of Love.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Eighth canto. The honeymoon</i>.The first month of marital bliss is
spent in Himalaya's palace. After this the happy pair wander for a
time among the famous mountain-peaks. One of these they reach at
sunset, and Shiva describes the evening glow to his bride. A few
stanzas are given here.</p><br>

<blockquote class="poem">

</p><br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Shiva then retires for meditation. On his return, he finds that his
bride is peevish at being left alone even for a little time, and to
soothe her, he describes the night which is now advancing. A few
stanzas of this description run as follows.</p><br>

</blockquote>
<p>

Shiva and Parvati then drink wine brought them by the guardian goddess
of the grove, and in this lovely spot they dwell happily for many
years.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Ninth canto. The journey to Mount Kailasa</i>.One day the god of fire
appears as a messenger from the gods before Shiva, to remonstrate with
him for not begetting the son upon whom heaven's welfare depends.
Shiva deposits his seed in Fire, who departs, bent low with the
burden. Shortly afterwards the gods wait upon Shiva and Parvati, who
journey with them to Mount Kailasa, the splendid dwelling-place of the
god of wealth. Here also Shiva and Parvati spend happy days.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Tenth canto. The birth of Kumara</i>.To Indra, king of the gods, Fire
betakes himself, tells his story, and begs to be relieved of his
burden. Indra advises him to deposit it in the Ganges. Fire therefore
travels to the Ganges, leaves Shiva's seed in the river, and departs
much relieved. But now it is the turn of Ganges to be distressed,
until at dawn the six Pleiades come to bathe in the river. They find
Shiva's seed and lay it in a nest of reeds, where it becomes a child,
Kumara, the future god of war.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Eleventh canto. The birth of Kumara, continued</i>.Ganges suckles the
beautiful infant. But there arises a dispute for the possession of the
child between Fire, Ganges, and the Pleiades. At this point Shiva and
Parvati arrive, and Parvati, wondering at the beauty of the infant and
at the strange quarrel, asks Shiva to whom the child belongs. When
Shiva tells her that Kumara is their own child, her joy is unbounded.</p><br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Shiva conducts Parvati and the boy back to Mount Kailasa, where gods
and fairies welcome them with music and dancing. Here the divine child
spends the days of a happy infancy, not very different from human
infancy; for he learns to walk, gets dirty in the courtyard, laughs a
good deal, pulls the scanty hair of an old servant, and learns to
count: "One, nine, two, ten, five, seven." These evidences of healthy
development cause Shiva and Parvati the most exquisite joy.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Twelfth canto. Kumara is made general</i>.Indra, with the other gods,
waits upon Shiva, to ask that Kumara, now a youth, may be lent to them
as their leader in the campaign against Taraka. The gods are
graciously received by Shiva, who asks their errand. Indra prefers
their request, whereupon Shiva bids his son assume command of the
gods, and slay Taraka. Great is the joy of Kumara himself, of his
mother Parvati, and of Indra.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Thirteenth canto. Kumara is consecrated general</i>.Kumara takes an
affectionate farewell of his parents, and sets out with the gods. When
they come to Indra's paradise, the gods are afraid to enter, lest they
find their enemy there. There is an amusing scene in which each
courteously invites the others to precede him, until Kumara ends their
embarrassment by leading the way. Here for the first time Kumara sees
with deep respect the heavenly Ganges, Indra's garden and palace, and
the heavenly city. But he becomes red-eyed with anger on beholding the
devastation wrought by Taraka.</p><br>

Amid these sorrowful surroundings the gods gather and anoint Kumara,
thus consecrating him as their general.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Fourteenth canto. The march</i>.Kumara prepares for battle, and
marshals his army. He is followed by Indra riding on an elephant, Agni
on a ram, Yama on a buffalo, a giant on a ghost, Varuna on a dolphin,
and many other lesser gods. When all is ready, the army sets out on
its dusty march.</p><br>
<p>

<i>Fifteenth canto. The two armies clash</i>.The demon Taraka is informed
that the hostile army is approaching, but scorns the often-conquered

marshals his army, and sets forth to meet the gods. But he is beset by
dreadful omens of evil.</p><br>

Taraka's counsellors endeavour to persuade him to turn back, but he
refuses; for timidity is not numbered among his faults. As he advances
even worse portents appear, and finally warning voices from heaven
call upon him to desist from his undertaking. The voices assure him of
Kumara's prowess and inevitable victory; they advise him to make his
peace while there is yet time. But Taraka's only answer is a defiance.</p><br>

And as Taraka emphasises his meaning by brandishing his great sword,
the warning spirits flee, their knees knocking together. Taraka laughs
horribly, then mounts his chariot, and advances against the army of
the gods. On the other side the gods advance, and the two armies

As the struggle comes to no decisive issue, Taraka seeks out the chief
gods, and charges upon them.</p><br>
<p>

<p>
And with this the duel begins. When Taraka finds his arrows parried by
Kumara, he employs the magic weapon of the god of wind. When this too
is parried, he uses the magic weapon of the god of fire, which Kumara
neutralises with the weapon of the god of water. As they fight on,
Kumara finds an opening, and slays Taraka with his lance, to the
unbounded delight of the universe.</p><br>
<p>
Here the poem ends, in the form in which it has come down to us. It
has been sometimes thought that we have less than Kalidasa wrote,
partly because of a vague tradition that there were once twenty-three
cantos, partly because the customary prayer is lacking at the end.
These arguments are not very cogent. Though the concluding prayer is
not given in form, yet the stanzas which describe the joy of the
universe fairly fill its place. And one does not see with what matter
further cantos would be concerned. The action promised in the earlier
part is completed in the seventeenth canto.</p><br>
<p>
It has been somewhat more formidably argued that the concluding cantos
are spurious, that Kalidasa wrote only the first seven or perhaps the
first eight cantos. Yet, after all, what do these arguments amount to
Hardly more than this, that the first eight cantos are better poetry
than the last nine. As if a poet were always at his best, even when
writing on a kind of subject not calculated to call out his best.
Fighting is not Kalidasa's <i>forte</i>; love is. Even so, there is great
vigour in the journey of Taraka, the battle, and the duel. It may not
be the highest kind of poetry, but it is wonderfully vigorous poetry
of its kind. And if we reject the last nine cantos, we fall into a
very much greater difficulty. The poem would be glaringly incomplete,
its early promise obviously disregarded. We should have a <i>Birth of
the War-god</i> in which the poet stopped before the war-god was born.</p><br>
<p>
There seems then no good reason to doubt that we have the epic
substantially as Kalidasa wrote it. Plainly, it has a unity which is
lacking in Kalidasa's other epic, <i>The Dynasty</i> <i>of Raghu</i>, though
in this epic, too, the interest shifts. Parvati's love-affair is the
matter of the first half, Kumara's fight with the demon the matter of
the second half. Further, it must be admitted that the interest runs a
little thin. Even in India, where the world of gods runs insensibly
into the world of men, human beings take more interest in the
adventures of men than of gods. The gods, indeed, can hardly have
adventures; they must be victorious. <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> pays
for its greater unity by a poverty of adventure.</p><br>
<p>
It would be interesting if we could know whether this epic was written
before or after <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>. But we have no data for
deciding the question, hardly any for even arguing it. The
introduction to <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> seems, indeed, to have been
written by a poet who yet had his spurs to win. But this is all.</p><br>
<p>
As to the comparative excellence of the two epics, opinions differ. My
own preference is for <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>, yet there are passages
in <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> of a piercing beauty which the world can
never let die.</p><br>

<h2>THE CLOUD-MESSENGER</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

<p>In <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i> Kalidasa created a new <i>genre</i> in Sanskrit
literature. Hindu critics class the poem with <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>
and <i>The Birth of the War-god</i> as a <i>kavya</i>, or learned epic. This it
obviously is not. It is fair enough to call it an elegiac poem, though
a precisian might object to the term.</p><br>
<p>We have already seen, in speaking of <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i>, what
admiration Kalidasa felt for his great predecessor Valmiki, the author
of the <i>Ramayana</i>; and it is quite possible that an episode of the
early epic suggested to him the idea which he has exquisitely treated
in <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i>. In the <i>Ramayana</i>, after the defeat and
death of Ravana, Rama returns with his wife and certain heroes of the
struggle from Ceylon to his home in Northern India. The journey, made
in an arial car, gives the author an opportunity to describe the
country over which the car must pass in travelling from one end of
India to the other. The hint thus given him was taken by Kalidasa; a
whole canto of <i>The Dynasty of Raghu</i> (the thirteenth) is concerned
with the arial journey. Now if, as seems not improbable, <i>The Dynasty
of Raghu</i> was the earliest of Kalidasa's more ambitious works, it is
perhaps legitimate to imagine him, as he wrote this canto, suddenly
inspired with the plan of <i>The Cloud-Messenger</i>.</p><br>
<p>This plan is slight and fanciful. A demigod, in consequence of some
transgression against his master, the god of wealth, is condemned to
leave his home in the Himalayas, and spend a year of exile on a peak
in the Vindhya Mountains, which divide the Deccan from the Ganges
basin. He wishes to comfort and encourage his wife, but has no
messenger to send her. In his despair, he begs a passing cloud to
carry his words. He finds it necessary to describe the long journey
which the cloud must take, and, as the two termini are skilfully
chosen, the journey involves a visit to many of the spots famous in
Indian story. The description of these spots fills the first half of
the poem. The second half is filled with a more minute description of
the heavenly city, of the home and bride of the demigod, and with the
message proper. The proportions of the poem may appear unfortunate to
the Western reader, in whom the proper names of the first half will
wake scanty associations. Indeed, it is no longer possible to identify
all the places mentioned, though the general route followed by the
cloud can be easily traced. The peak from which he starts is probably
one near the modern Nagpore. From this peak he flies a little west of
north to the Nerbudda River, and the city of Ujjain; thence pretty
straight north to the upper Ganges and the Himalaya. The geography of
the magic city of Alaka is quite mythical.</p><br>
<p><i>The Cloud-Messenger</i> contains one hundred and fifteen four-line
stanzas, in a majestic metre called the "slow-stepper." The English
stanza which has been chosen for the translation gives perhaps as fair
a representation of the original movement as may be, where direct
imitation is out of the question. Though the stanza of the translation
has five lines to four for the slow-stepper, it contains fewer
syllables; a constant check on the temptation to padding.</p><br>
<p>The analysis which accompanies the poem, and which is inserted in
Italics at the beginning of each stanza, has more than one object. It
saves footnotes; it is intended as a real help to comprehension; and
it is an eminently Hindu device. Indeed, it was my first intention to
translate literally portions of Mallinatha's famous commentary; and
though this did not prove everywhere feasible, there is nothing in the
analysis except matter suggested by the commentary.</p><br>
<p>One minor point calls for notice. The word Himlaya has been accented
on the second syllable wherever it occurs. This accent is historically
correct, and has some foothold in English usage; besides, it is more
euphonious and better adapted to the needs of the metre.</p><br>

<h2>THE SEASONS</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<i>The Seasons</i> is an unpretentious poem, describing in six short cantos
the six seasons into which the Hindus divide the year. The title is
perhaps a little misleading, as the description is not objective, but
deals with the feelings awakened by each season in a pair of young
lovers. Indeed, the poem might be called a Lover's Calendar.
Kalidasa's authorship has been doubted, without very cogent argument.
The question is not of much interest, as <i>The Seasons</i> would neither
add greatly to his reputation nor subtract from it.</p><br>
<p>
The whole poem contains one hundred and forty-four stanzas, or
something less than six hundred lines of verse. There follow a few
stanzas selected from each canto.</p><br>

<h1>EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY</h1><br>
<h2>By Ernest Rhys</h2>

<p>
Victor Hugo said a Library was "an act of faith," and some unknown
essayist spoke of one so beautiful, so perfect, so harmonious in all
its parts, that he who made it was smitten with a passion. In that
faith the promoters of Everyman's Library planned it out originally on
a large scale; and their idea in so doing was to make it conform as
far as possible to a perfect scheme. However, perfection is a thing to
be aimed at and not to be achieved in this difficult world; and since
the first volumes appeared, now several years ago, there have been
many interruptions. A great war has come and gone; and even the City
of Books has felt something like a world commotion. Only in recent
years is the series getting back into its old stride and looking
forward to complete its original scheme of a Thousand Volumes. One of
the practical expedients in that original plan was to divide the
volumes into sections, as Biography, Fiction, History, Belles Lettres,
Poetry, Romance, and so forth; with a compartment for young people,
and last, and not least, one of Reference Books. Beside the
dictionaries and encyclopdias to be expected in that section, there
was a special set of literary and historical atlases. One of these
atlases dealing with Europe, we may recall, was directly affected by
the disturbance of frontiers during the war; and the maps had to be
completely revised in consequence, so as to chart the New Europe which
we hope will now preserve its peace under the auspices of the League
of Nations set up at Geneva. That is only one small item, however, in
a library list which runs already to the final centuries of the
Thousand. The largest slice of this huge provision is, as a matter of
course, given to the tyrannous demands of fiction. But in carrying out
the scheme, publishers and editors contrived to keep in mind that
books, like men and women, have their elective affinities. The present
volume, for instance, will be found to have its companion books, both
in the same section and even more significantly in other sections.
With that idea too, novels like Walter Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i> and <i> Fortunes
of Nigel</i>, Lytton's <i>Harold</i> and Dickens's <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>, have
been used as pioneers of history and treated as a sort of holiday
history books. For in our day history is tending to grow more
documentary and less literary; and "the historian who is a stylist,"
as one of our contributors, the late Thomas Seccombe, said, "will soon
be regarded as a kind of Phoenix." But in this special department of
Everyman's Library we have been eclectic enough to choose our history
men from every school in turn. We have Grote, Gibbon, Finlay,
Macaulay, Motley, Frescott. We have among earlier books the Venerable
Bede and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, have completed a Livy in an
admirable new translation by Canon Roberts, while Csar, Tacitus,
Thucydides and Herodotus are not forgotten. "You only, O Books," said
Richard de Bury, "are liberal and independent; you give to all who
ask." The delightful variety, the wisdom and the wit which are at the
disposal of Everyman in his own library may well, at times, seem to
him a little embarrassing. He may turn to Dick Steele in <i>The
Spectator</i> and learn how Cleomira dances, when the elegance of her
motion is unimaginable and "her eyes are chastised with the simplicity
and innocence of her thoughts." He may turn to Plato's Phdrus and
read how every soul is divided into three parts (like Csar's Gaul).
He may turn to the finest critic of Victorian times, Matthew Arnold,
and find in his essay on Maurice de Guerin the perfect key to what is
there called the "magical power of poetry." It is Shakespeare, with
his</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i8">"daffodils</span><br>

<span class="i2">That come before the swallow dares, and take</span><br>

<span class="i2">The winds of March with beauty;"<br></span></p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>it is Wordsworth, with his</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i6">"voice ... heard</span><br>
<span class="i2">In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,</span><br>
<span class="i2">Breaking the silence of the seas</span><br>
<span class="i2">Among the farthest Hebrides;"</span><br>
</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>or Keats, with his</p><br>
<blockquote class="poem">
<p>
<span class="i2">".... moving waters at their priest-like task</span><br>
<span class="i2">Of cold ablution round Earth's human shores."<br></span></p><br>
</blockquote>
<br> <br>
<p>William Hazlitt's "Table Talk," among the volumes of
 Essays, may help to show the relationship of one author to
 another, which is another form of the Friendship of Books. His
 incomparable essay in that volume, "On Going a Journey," forms a capital
 prelude to Coleridge's "Biographia Literaria" and to his and
 Wordsworth's poems. In the same way one may turn to the review of
 Moore's Life of Byron in Macaulay's <i>Essays</i> as a prelude to the three
 volumes of Byron's own poems, remembering that the poet whom Europe
 loved more than England did was as Macaulay said: "the beginning, the
 middle and the end of all his own poetry." This brings us to the
 provoking reflection that it is the obvious authors and the books most
 easy to reprint which have been the signal successes out of the many
 hundreds in the series, for Everyman is distinctly proverbial in
 his tastes. He likes best of all an old author who has worn well or a
 comparatively new author who has gained something like newspaper
 notoriety. In attempting to lead him on from the good books that are
 known to those that are less known, the publishers may have at times
 been too adventurous. The late <i>Chief</i> himself was much more than an
 ordinary book-producer in this critical enterprise. He threw himself
 into it with the zeal of a book-lover and indeed of one who, like
 Milton, thought that books might be as alive and productive as dragons'
 teeth, which, being "sown up and down the land, might chance to spring
 up armed men." Mr. Pepys in his <i>Diary</i> writes about some of his books,
 "which are come home gilt on the backs, very handsome to the eye." The
 pleasure he took in them is that which Everyman may take in the gilt
 backs of his favourite books in his own Library, which after all he has
 helped to make good and lasting.</p><br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
 the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
 you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is
 owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
 has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
 Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments
 must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
 prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
 returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
 sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
 address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
 the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License. You must require such a user to return or
 destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
 and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
 Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
 money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
 of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
