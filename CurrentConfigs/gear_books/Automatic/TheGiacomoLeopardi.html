<p>Giacomo Leopardi is a great name in Italy
among philosophers and poets, but is quite unknown
in this country, and Mr. Townsend has the
honor of introducing him, in the most captivating
way, to his countrymen. In Germany and France
he has excited attention. Translations have been
made of his works; essays have been written on his
ideas. But in England his name is all but unheard
of. Six or seven years ago Mr. Charles Edwards
published a translation of the essays and dialogues,
but no version of the poems has appeared, so far as
I know. Leopardi was substantially a poet,?that
is to say, he had imagination, sentiment, passion,
an intense love of beauty, a powerful impulse towards
things ideal. The sad tone of his speculations
about the universe and human destiny gave
an impression of mournfulness to his lines, but
this rather deepened the pathos of his work. In
the same breath he sang of love and the grave, and
the love was the more eager for its brevity. He
had the poetic temperament?sensitive, ardent,
aspiring. He possessed the poetic aspect?the
broad white brow, the large blue eyes. Some
compared him to Byron, but the resemblance was
external merely. In ideas, purpose, feeling, he was
entirely unlike the Englishman; in the energy and
fire of his style only did he somewhat resemble
him. Worshippers have even ventured to class
him with Dante, a comparison which shows, at
least, in what estimation the poet could be held at
home, and how largely the patriotic sentiment
entered into the conception of poetical compositions,
how necessary it was that the singer should
be a bard. His verses ranged over a large field.
They were philosophic, patriotic, amorous. There
are odes, lyrics, satires, songs; many very beautiful
and feeling; all noble and earnest. His three
poems, ?All' Italia,? ?Sopra il Monumento di
Dante,? ?A Angelo Mai,? gave him a national
reputation. They touch the chords to which he
always responded?patriotism, poetry, learning, a
national idealism bearing aloft an enormous weight
of erudition and thought.</p><br>

<p>Leopardi was born at Recanati, a small town
about fifteen miles from Ancona, in 1798. He was
of noble parentage, though not rich. His early
disposition was joyous, but with the feverish joy of
a highly-strung, nervous organization. He was a
great student from boyhood; and severe application
undermined a system that was never robust,
and that soon became hopelessly diseased. Illness,
accompanied with sharp pain, clipped the wings of
his ambition, obliged him to forego preferment,
and deepened the hopelessness that hung over his
expectations. His hunger for love could not be
satisfied, for his physical infirmity rendered a union
undesirable, even if possible, while a craving
ideality soon transcended any visible object of
affection. He had warm friends of his own sex,
one of whom, Antonio Ranieri, stayed by him in
all vicissitudes, took him to Naples, and closed his
eyes, June 14, 1837.</p><br>

<p>To this acute sensibility of frame must be added
the torture of the heart arising from a difference
with his father, who, as a Catholic, was disturbed
by the skeptical tendencies of his son, and the perpetual
irritation of a conflict with the large majority
of even philosophical minds. An early death
might have been anticipated. No amount of hopefulness,
of zest for life, of thirst for opportunity, of
genius for intellectual productiveness will counteract
such predisposition to decay. The death of the
body, however, has but ensured a speedier immortality
of the soul; for many a thinker has since
been busy in gathering up the fragments of his mind
and keeping his memory fresh. His immense
learning has been forgotten. His arch?ological
knowledge, which fascinated Niebuhr, is of small
account to-day. But his speculative and poetical
genius is a permanent illumination.</p><br>

<p>Mr. Townsend, the translator, well known in New
York, where he was born, lived ten years in Italy,
and seven in Rome. He was a studious, thoughtful
man; quiet, secluded, scholarly; an eminent
student of Italian literature; a real sympathizer
with Italian progress. By the cast of his mind and
the course of his inward experience he was drawn
towards Leopardi. His version adheres as closely
to the original as is compatible with elegance and
the preservation of metrical grace. He has not
rendered into English all Leopardi's poems, but he
has presented the best of them, enough to give an
idea of his author's style of feeling and expression.
What he has done, has been performed faithfully.
It is worth remarking that he was attracted by the
intense longing of the poet for love and appreciation,
and by keen sympathy with his unhappy condition.
It is needless to say that he did not share
the pessimism that imparts a melancholy hue to
the philosopher's own doctrine, and that might have
been modified if not dispelled by a different experience.
The translation was finished at Siena, the
summer of the earthquake, and was the last work
Mr. Townsend ever did, the commotion outside not
interrupting him, or causing him to suspend his application.</p><br>

<h2>Dedication.</h2>

<p class="central">[From the first Florentine Edition of the Poems, in the year 1831.]</p><br>

<p><i>To my Friends in Tuscany:</i></p><br>

<p>My dear Friends, I dedicate this book to you, in
which, as is oft the case with Poets, I have sought
to illustrate my sorrow, and with which I now?I
cannot say it without tears?take leave of Literature
and of my studies. I hoped these dear studies
would have been the consolation of my old age, and
thought, after having lost all the other joys and
blessings of childhood and of youth, I had secured
<i>one</i>, of which no power, no unhappiness could rob
me. But I was scarcely twenty years old, when
that weakness of nerves and of stomach, which has
destroyed my life, and yet gives me no hope of
death, robbed that only blessing of more than half
its value, and, in my twenty-eighth year, has utterly
deprived me of it, and, as I <i>must</i> think, forever. I
have not been able to read these pages, and have
been compelled to entrust their revision to other
eyes and other hands. I will utter no more complaints,
my dear friends; the consciousness of the
depth of my affliction admits not of complaints and
lamentations. I have lost all; I am a withered
branch, that feels and suffers still. <i>You</i> only have
I won! Your society, which must compensate me
for all my studies, joys, and hopes, would almost
outweigh my sorrows, did not my very sickness
prevent me from enjoying it as I could wish, and
did I not know that Fate will soon deprive me of
this benefit, also, and will compel me to spend the
remainder of my days, far from all the delights of
civilized life, in a spot, far better suited to the dead
than to the living. Your love, meanwhile, will ever
follow me, and will yet cling to me, perhaps, when
this body, which, indeed, no longer lives, shall be
turned to ashes. Farewell! Your</p><br>

<h2>TO ITALY. (1818.)</h2>

<p><span class="i0">My country, I the walls, the arches see,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The columns, statues, and the towers</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deserted, of our ancestors;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, ah, the glory I do not behold,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The laurel and the sword, that graced</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our sires of old.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now, all unarmed, a naked brow,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A naked breast dost thou display.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, me, how many wounds, what stains of blood!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, what a sight art thou,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Most beautiful of women! I</span><br>
<span class="i0">To heaven cry aloud, and to the world:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Who hath reduced her to this pass?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Say, say!? And worst of all, alas,</span><br>
<span class="i0">See, both her arms in chains are bound!</span><br>
<span class="i0">With hair dishevelled, and without a veil</span><br>
<span class="i0">She sits, disconsolate, upon the ground,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hides her face between her knees,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As she bewails her miseries.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, weep, my Italy, for thou hast cause;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou, who wast born the nations to subdue,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As victor, and as victim, too!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, if thy eyes two living fountains were,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The volume of their tears could ne'er express</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy utter helplessness, thy shame;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou, who wast once the haughty dame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, now, the wretched slave.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who speaks, or writes of thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That must not bitterly exclaim:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?She once was great, but, oh, behold her now??</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why hast thou fallen thus, oh, why?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where is the ancient force?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where are the arms, the valor, constancy?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who hath deprived thee of thy sword?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What treachery, what skill, what labor vast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or what o'erwhelming horde</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose fierce, invading tide, thou could'st not stem,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hath robbed thee of thy robe and diadem?</span><br>
<span class="i0">From such a height how couldst thou fall so low?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will none defend thee? No?</span><br>
<span class="i0">No son of thine? For arms, for arms, I call;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alone I'll fight for thee, alone will fall.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And from my blood, a votive offering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">May flames of fire in every bosom spring!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where are thy sons? The sound of arms I hear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of chariots, of voices, and of drums;</span><br>
<span class="i0">From foreign lands it comes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For which thy children fight.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, hearken, hearken, Italy! I see,?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or is it but a dream??</span><br>
<span class="i0">A wavering of horse and foot,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And smoke, and dust, and flashing swords,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That like the lightning gleam.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Art thou not comforted? Dost turn away</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy eyes, in horror, from the doubtful fray?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ye gods, ye gods. Oh, can it be?</span><br>
<span class="i0">The youth of Italy</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their hireling swords for other lands have bared!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, wretched he in war who falls,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not for his native shores,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His loving wife and children dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, fighting for another's gain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And by another's foe is slain!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor can he say, as his last breath he draws,</span><br>
<span class="i0">?My mother-land, beloved, ah see,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The life thou gav'st, I render back to thee!?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh fortunate and dear and blessed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The ancient days, when rushed to death the brave,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In crowds, their country's life to save!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And you, forever glorious,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thessalian straits,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where Persia, Fate itself, could not withstand</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fiery zeal of that devoted band!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Do not the trees, the rocks, the waves,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mountains, to each passer-by,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With low and plaintive voice tell</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wondrous tale of those who fell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Heroes invincible who gave</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their lives, their Greece to save?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then cowardly as fierce,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Xerxes across the Hellespont retired,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A laughing-stock to all succeeding time;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And up Anthela's hill, where, e'en in death</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sacred Band immortal life obtained,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Simonides slow-climbing, thoughtfully,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Looked forth on sea and shore and sky.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And then, his cheeks with tears bedewed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And heaving breast, and trembling foot, he stood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His lyre in hand and sang:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?O ye, forever blessed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who bared your breasts unto the foeman's lance,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For love of her, who gave you birth;</span><br>
<span class="i0">By Greece revered, and by the world admired,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What ardent love your youthful minds inspired,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To rush to arms, such perils dire to meet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A fate so hard, with loving smiles to greet?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her children, why so joyously,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ran ye, that stern and rugged pass to guard?</span><br>
<span class="i0">As if unto a dance,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or to some splendid feast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each one appeared to haste,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And not grim death Death to brave;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But Tartarus awaited ye,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the cold Stygian wave;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor were your wives or children at your side,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When, on that rugged shore,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Without a kiss, without a tear, ye died.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But not without a fearful blow</span><br>
<span class="i0">To Persians dealt, and their undying shame.</span><br>
<span class="i0">As at a herd of bulls a lion glares,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then, plunging in, upon the back</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this one leaps, and with his claws</span><br>
<span class="i0">A passage all along his chine he tears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And fiercely drives his teeth into his sides,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such havoc Grecian wrath and valor made</span><br>
<span class="i0">Amongst the Persian ranks, dismayed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold each prostrate rider and his steed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold the chariots, and the fallen tents,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A tangled mass their flight impede;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And see, among the first to fly,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The tyrant, pale, and in disorder wild!</span><br>
<span class="i0">See, how the Grecian youths,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With blood barbaric dyed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And dealing death on every side,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By slow degrees by their own wounds subdued,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The one upon the other fall. Farewell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ye heroes blessed, whose names shall live,</span><br>
<span class="i0">While tongue can speak, or pen your story tell!</span><br>
<span title="Original began with a double-quote" class="i0">Sooner the stars, torn from their spheres, shall hiss,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Extinguished in the bottom of the sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than the dear memory, and love of you,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shall suffer loss, or injury.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Your tomb an altar is; the mothers here</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shall come, unto their little ones to show</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lovely traces of your blood. Behold,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ye blessed, myself upon the ground I throw,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And kiss these stones, these clods</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose fame, unto the end of time,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shall sacred be in every clime.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, had I, too, been here with you,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And this dear earth had moistened with my blood!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But since stern Fate would not consent</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I for Greece my dying eyes should close,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In conflict with her foes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still may the gracious gods accept</span><br>
<span class="i0">The offering I bring,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And grant to me the precious boon,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Your Hymn of Praise to sing!?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Though all the nations now</span><br>
<span class="i0">Peace gathers under her white wings,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The minds of Italy will ne'er be free</span><br>
<span class="i0">From the restraints of their old lethargy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till our ill-fated land cling fast</span><br>

<span class="i0">Fit honor to thy dead to pay;</span><br>

<span class="i0">Nor is there one whom thou canst reverence!</span><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou for thyself no joy wouldst feel,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But for thy native land,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If the example of their sires</span><br>
<span class="i0">Could in the cold and sluggish sons</span><br>
<span class="i0">Renew once more the ancient fires,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That they might lift their heads in pride again.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, with what protracted sufferings</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou seest her afflicted, that, e'en then</span><br>
<span class="i0">Did seem to know no end,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When thou anew didst unto Paradise ascend!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Reduced so low, that, as thou seest her now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">She then a happy Queen appeared.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such misery her heart doth grieve,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As, seeing, thou canst not thy eyes believe.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And oh, the last, most bitter blow of all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When on the ground, as she in anguish lay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">It seemed, indeed, thy country's dying day!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O happy thou, whom Fate did not condemn</span><br>
<span class="i0">To live amid such horrors; who</span><br>
<span class="i0">Italian wives didst not behold</span><br>
<span class="i0">By ruffian troops embraced;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor cities plundered, fields laid waste</span><br>
<span class="i0">By hostile spear, and foreign rage;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor works divine of genius borne away</span><br>
<span class="i0">In sad captivity, beyond the Alps,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The roads encumbered with the precious prey;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor foreign rulers' insolence and pride;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor didst insulting voices hear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Amidst the sound of chains and whips,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sacred name of Liberty deride.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who suffers not? Oh! at these wretches' hands,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What have we not endured?</span><br>
<span class="i0">From what unholy deed have they refrained?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What temple, altar, have they not profaned?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why have we fallen on such evil times?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why didst thou give us birth, or why</span><br>
<span class="i0">No sooner suffer us to die,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O cruel Fate? We, who have seen</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our wretched country so betrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The handmaid, slave of impious strangers made,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of her ancient virtues all bereft;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet could no aid or comfort give.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or ray of hope, that might relieve</span><br>
<span class="i0">The anguish of her soul.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, my blood has not been shed for thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My country dear! Nor have I died</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thou mightst live!</span><br>
<span class="i0">My heart with anger and with pity bleeds.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, bitter thought! Thy children fought and fell;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But not for dying Italy, ah, no,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But in the service of her cruel foe!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Father, if this enrage thee not,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How changed art thou from what thou wast on earth!</span><br>
<span class="i0">On Russia's plains, so bleak and desolate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They died, the sons of Italy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, well deserving of a better fate!</span><br>
<span class="i0">In cruel war with men, with beasts,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The elements! In heaps they strewed the ground;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Half-clad, emaciated, stained with blood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A bed of ice for their sick frames they found.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then, when the parting hour drew near,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In fond remembrance of that mother dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They cried: ?Oh had we fallen by the foeman's hand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And not the victims of the clouds and storms,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for <i>thy</i> good, our native land!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now, far from thee, and in the bloom of youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unknown to all, we yield our parting breath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And die for <i>her</i>, who caused our country's death!?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The northern desert and the whispering groves,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sole witnesses of their lament,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As thus they passed away!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And their neglected corpses, as they lay</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon that horrid sea of snow exposed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were by the beasts consumed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The memories of the brave and good,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of the coward and the vile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the same oblivion doomed!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dear souls, though infinite your wretchedness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Rest, rest in peace! And yet what peace is yours,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who can no comfort ever know</span><br>
<span class="i0">While Time endures!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Rest in the depths of your unmeasured woe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O ye, <i>her</i> children true,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose fate alone with hers may vie,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In endless, hopeless misery!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But she rebukes you not,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, no, but these alone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who forced you with her to contend;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And still her bitter tears she blends with yours,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In wretchedness that knows no end.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh that some pity in the heart were born,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For her, who hath all other glories won,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of one, who from this dark, profound abyss,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her weak and weary feet could guide!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou glorious shade, oh! say,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Does no one love thy Italy?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Say, is the flame that kindled thee extinct?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And will that myrtle never bloom again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That hath so long consoled us in our pain?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must all our garlands wither in the dust?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And shall we a redeemer never see,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who may, in part, at least, resemble thee?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Are we forever lost?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is there no limit to our shame?</span><br>
<span class="i0">I, while I live, will never cease to cry:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Degenerate race, think of thy ancestry!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold these ruins vast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">These pictures, statues, temples, poems grand!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Think of the glories of thy native land!</span><br>
<span class="i0">If they thy soul cannot inspire or warn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why linger here? Arise! Begone!</span><br>
<span class="i0">This holy ground must not be thus defiled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And must no shelter give</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the coward and the slave!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Far better were the silence of the grave!?</span></p><br>

<h2>TO ANGELO MAI,<br><small>ON HIS DISCOVERY OF THE LOST BOOKS OF CICERO, ?DE REPUBLICA.?</small></h2>

<p><span class="i0">Italian bold, why wilt thou never cease</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fathers from their tombs to summon forth?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why bring them, with this dead age to converse,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That stifled is by enemies and by sloth?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And why dost thou, voice of our ancestors,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That hast so long been mute,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Resound so loud and frequent in our ears?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why all these grand discoveries?</span><br>
<span class="i0">As in a flash the fruitful pages come,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What hath this wretched age deserved,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That dusty cloisters have for it reserved</span><br>
<span class="i0">These hidden treasures of the wise and brave?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Illustrious man, with what strange power</span><br>
<span class="i0">Does Fate thy ardent zeal befriend?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or does Fate vainly with man's will contend?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Without the lofty counsel of the gods,</span><br>
<span class="i0">It surely could not be, that now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When we were never sunk so low,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In desperate oblivion of the Past,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each moment, comes a cry renewed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From our great sires, to shake our souls, at last!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Heaven still some pity shows for Italy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Some god hath still our happiness at heart:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Since this, or else no other, is the hour,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Italian virtue to redeem,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And its old lustre once more to impart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">These pleading voices from the grave we hear;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forgotten heroes rise from earth again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To see, my country, if at this late day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou still art pleased the coward's part to play.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And do ye cherish still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Illustrious shades, some hope of us?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have we not perished utterly?</span><br>
<span class="i0">To you, perhaps, it is allowed, to read</span><br>
<span class="i0">The book of destiny. <i>I</i> am dismayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And have no refuge from my grief;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For dark to me the future is, and all</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I discern is such, as makes hope seem</span><br>
<span class="i0">A fable and a dream. To your old homes</span><br>
<span class="i0">A wretched crew succeed; to noble act or word,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They pay no heed; for your eternal fame</span><br>
<span class="i0">They know no envy, feel no blush of shame.</span><br>
<span class="i0">A filthy mob your monuments defile:</span><br>
<span class="i0">To ages yet unborn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">We have become a by-word and a scorn.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou noble spirit, if no others care</span><br>
<span class="i0">For our great Fathers' fame, oh, care thou still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou, to whom Fate hath so benignant been,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That those old days appear again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When, roused from dire oblivion's tomb,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Came forth, with all the treasures of their lore,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those ancient bards, divine, with whom</span><br>
<span class="i0">Great Nature spake, but still behind her veil,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with her mysteries graced</span><br>
<span class="i0">The holidays of Athens and of Rome.</span><br>
<span class="i0">O times, now buried in eternal sleep!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our country's ruin was not then complete;</span><br>
<span class="i0">We then a life of wretched sloth disdained;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still from our native soil were borne afar,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Some sparks of genius by the passing air.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thy holy ashes still were warm,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whom hostile fortune ne'er unmanned;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto whose anger and whose grief,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hell was more grateful than thy native land.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, what, but hell, has Italy become?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thy sweet cords</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still trembled at the touch of thy right hand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unhappy bard of love.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, Italian song is still the child</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of sorrow born.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, less hard to bear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Consuming grief than dull vacuity!</span><br>
<span class="i0">O blessed thou, whose life was one lament!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Disgust and nothingness are still our doom,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And by our cradle sit, and on our tomb.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But thy life, then, was with the stars and sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Liguria's hardy son,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When thou, beyond the columns and the shores,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where oft, at set of sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The waves are heard to hiss,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As he into their depths has plunged,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Committed to the boundless deep,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Didst find again the sun's declining ray,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The new-born day didst find,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When it from us had passed away;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Defying Nature's every obstacle,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A land unknown didst win, the glorious spoils</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of all thy perils, all thy toils.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, when known, the world seems smaller still;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And earth and ocean, and the heavenly sphere</span><br>
<span class="i0">More vast unto the child, than to the sage appear.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Where now are all the charming dreams</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the mysterious retreats</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of dwellers unto us unknown,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or where, by day, the stars to rest have gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or of the couch remote of Eos bright,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or of the sun's mysterious sleep at night?</span><br>
<span class="i0">They, in an instant, vanished all;</span><br>
<span class="i0">A little chart portrays this earthly ball.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lo, all things are alike; discovery</span><br>
<span class="i0">But proves the way for dull vacuity.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Farewell to thee, O Fancy, dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If plain, unvarnished truth appear!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thought more and more is still estranged from thee;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy power so mighty once, will soon be gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And our poor, wounded hearts be left forlorn.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But thou for these sweet dreams wast born,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the <i>old</i> sun upon thee shone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Delightful singer of the arms, and loves,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That in an age far happier than our own,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Men's lives with pleasing errors filled.</span><br>
<span class="i0">New hope of Italy! O towers, O caves,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O ladies, cavaliers,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O gardens, palaces! Amenites,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At thought of which, the mind</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is lost in thousand splendid reveries!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ye lovely fables, and ye thoughts grotesque,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now banished! And what to us remains?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now that the bloom from all things is removed?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, the sole, the certain thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That all except our wretchedness, is nought.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Torquato, O Torquato, heaven to us</span><br>
<span class="i0">The rich gift of thy genius gave, to thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nought else but misery.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ill-starred Torquato, whom thy song,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So sweet, could not console,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor melt the ice, to which</span><br>
<span class="i0">The genial current of thy soul</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was turned, by private envy, princely hate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And then, by Love abandoned, life's last dream!</span><br>
<span class="i0">To thee, nought real seemed but nothingness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The world a dreary wilderness.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too late the honors came, so long deferred;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, to die was unto thee a gain.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who knows the evils of our mortal state,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Demands but death, no garland asks, of Fate.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Return, return to us,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Rise from thy silent, dreary tomb,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And feast thine eyes on our distress,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O thou, whose life was crowned with wretchedness!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Far worse than what appeared to thee so sad</span><br>
<span class="i0">And infamous, have all our lives become.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dear friend, who now would pity thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When none save for himself hath thought or care?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who would not thy keen anguish folly call,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When all things great and rare the name of folly bear?</span><br>
<span class="i0">When envy, no, but worse than envy, far,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Indifference pervades our rulers all?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, who would now, when we all think</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of song so little, and so much of gain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A laurel for thy brow prepare again?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ah, since thy day, there has appeared but one,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who has the fame of Italy redeemed:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too good for his vile age, he stands alone;</span><br>
<span class="i0">One of the fierce Allobroges,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose manly virtue was derived</span><br>
<span class="i0">Direct from heavenly powers,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not from this dry, unfruitful earth of ours;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whence he alone, unarmed,?</span><br>
<span class="i0">O matchless courage!?from the stage,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Did war upon the ruthless tyrants wage;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The only war, the only weapon left,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Against the crimes and follies of the age.</span><br>
<span class="i0">First, and alone, he took the field:</span><br>
<span class="i0">None followed him; all else were cowards tame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lost to all sense of honor, or of shame.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Devoured by anger and by grief,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His spotless life he passed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till from worse scenes released by death, at last.</span><br>
<span class="i0">O my Victorio, this was not for thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fitting age, or land.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Great souls congenial times and climes demand.</span><br>
<span class="i0">In mere repose we live content,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And vulgar mediocrity;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wise man sinks, the mob ascends,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till all at last in one dread level ends.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Go on, thou great discoverer!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Revive the dead, since all the living sleep!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dead tongues of ancient heroes arm anew;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till this vile age a new life strive to win</span><br>
<span class="i0">By noble deeds, or perish in its sin!</span></p><br>

<h2>TO HIS SISTER PAOLINA,<br><small>ON HER APPROACHING MARRIAGE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="i0">Since now thou art about to leave</span><br>

<span class="i0">And all the phantoms and illusions dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That heaven-born fancies round it weave,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And to this lonely region lend their charm,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the dust and noise of life condemned,</span><br>

<span class="i0">My sister dear, who, in these mournful times,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, wilt more unhappy souls bestow</span><br>

<span class="i0">Nor in weak souls can purity reside.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thy sons must either poor, or cowards be.</span><br>

<span class="i0">But that we must to heaven leave.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Be this, above all things, thy care,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy children still to rear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As those who court not Fortune's smiles,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor playthings are of idle hope, or fear:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so the future age will call them blessed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For, in this slothful and deceitful world,</span><br>

<span class="i0">Ah, not unto our injury and shame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">On the soft lustre of your eyes</span><br>
<span class="i0">A power far mightier was conferred</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than that of fire or sword!</span><br>

<span class="i0">Your judgment led; nay all who live</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath the sun, to you still bend the knee.</span><br>
<span class="i0">On you I call, then; answer me!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have <i>you</i> youth's holy aspirations quenched?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And are our natures broken, crushed by <i>you</i>?</span><br>
<span class="i0">These sluggish minds, these low desires,</span><br>
<span class="i0">These nerveless arms, these feeble knees.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Say, say, are you to blame for these?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Love is the spur to noble deeds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To him its worth who knows;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And beauty still to lofty love inspires.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Love never in his spirit glows,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose heart exults not in his breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When angry winds in fight descend,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And heaven gathers all its clouds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And mountain crests the lightnings rend.</span><br>
<span class="i0">O wives, O maidens, he</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who shrinks from danger, turns his back upon</span><br>
<span class="i0">His country in her need, and only seeks</span><br>
<span class="i0">His base desires and appetites to feed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Excites your hatred and your scorn;</span><br>
<span class="i0">If ye for men, and not for milk-sops, feel</span><br>
<span class="i0">The glow of love o'er your soft bosoms steal.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The mothers of unwarlike sons</span><br>
<span class="i0">O may ye ne'er be called!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Your children still inure</span><br>
<span class="i0">For virtue's sake all trials to endure;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To scorn the vices of this wretched age;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To cherish loyal thoughts, and high desires;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And learn how much they owe unto their sires.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sons of Sparta thus became,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Amid the memories of heroes old,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deserving of the Grecian name;</span><br>
<span class="i0">While the young spouse the trusty sword</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the loved one's side would gird,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, afterwards, with her black locks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The bloodless, naked corpse concealed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When homeward borne upon the faithful shield.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Virginia, thy soft cheek</span><br>
<span class="i0">In Beauty's finest mould was framed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But thy disdain Rome's haughty lord inflamed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">How lovely wast thou, in thy youth's sweet prime,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When the rough dagger of thy sire</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy snowy breast did smite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou, a willing victim, didst descend</span><br>
<span class="i0">Into realms of night!</span><br>
<span class="i0">?May old age wither and consume my frame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O father,??thus she said;</span><br>
<span class="i0">?And may they now for me the tomb prepare,</span><br>

<span class="i0">Of that foul tyrant share:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And if my blood new life and liberty</span><br>
<span class="i0">May give to Rome, by thy hand let me die!?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ah, in those better days</span><br>
<span class="i0">When more propitious shone the sun than now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy tomb, dear child, was not left comfortless,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But honored with the tears of all.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold, around thy lovely corpse, the sons</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of Romulus with holy wrath inflamed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold the tyrants locks with dust besmeared;</span><br>

<span class="i0">The sacred name of Liberty revered;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold o'er all the subjugated earth,</span><br>

<p><span class="i0">The face of glory and her pleasant voice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O fortunate youth, now recognize,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And how much nobler than effeminate sloth</span><br>

<span class="i0">Take heed, O generous champion, take heed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If thou thy name by worthy thought or deed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From Time's all-sweeping current couldst redeem;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Take heed, and lift thy heart to high desires!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The amphitheatre's applause, the public voice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now summon thee to deeds illustrious;</span><br>

<p><span class="i0"><i>His</i> hand was ne'er with blood barbaric stained,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At Marathon,</span><br>

<span class="i0">And feel no glow of emulous zeal within,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The laurel wreath of victory to win.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And he, who in Alph&#275;us stream did wash</span><br>
<span class="i0">The dusty manes and foaming flanks</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of his victorious mares, <i>he</i> best could lead</span><br>
<span class="i0">The Grecian banners and the Grecian swords</span><br>
<span class="i0">Against the flying, panic-stricken ranks</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of Medes, who, dying, Asia's shore</span><br>

<span class="i0">Or animate anew to high resolve,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The drooping fervor of our weary souls?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What but a game have mortal works e'er been,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Since Ph?bus first his weary wheels did urge?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And is not truth, no less than falsehood, vain?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, with pleasing phantoms, fleeting shows,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nature herself to our relief has come;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And custom, aiding nature, still must strive</span><br>

<span class="i0">Or else all thirst for noble deeds is gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is lost in sloth, and blind oblivion.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The time may come, perchance, when midst</span><br>
<span class="i0">The ruins of Italian palaces,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will herds of cattle graze,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the seven hills the plough will feel;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not many years will have elapsed, perchance,</span><br>

<span class="i0">What is our life? A thing to be despised:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Least wretched, when with perils so beset,</span><br>

<span class="i0">Who were not born to wretchedness, like ours.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Immedicable woes, a life of tears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The silent tomb, eternal night, to find</span><br>
<span class="i0">More sweet, by far, than the ethereal light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">These things were not by heaven's gracious law</span><br>
<span class="i0">Imposed on you. If ancient legends speak</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of sins of yours, that brought calamity</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the human race, and fell disease,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, the sins more terrible, by far,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Committed by your children, and their souls</span><br>

<span class="i0">A brother's blood, in sudden frenzy shed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And now, alas, first hears the gentle air</span><br>
<span class="i0">The whirring of the fearful wings of Death.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The trembling fratricide, a fugitive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lonely shades avoids; in every blast</span><br>
<span class="i0">That sweeps the groves, a voice of wrath he hears.</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>He</i> the first city builds, abode and realm</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of wasting cares; repentance desperate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Heart-sick, and groaning, thus unites and binds</span><br>
<span class="i0">Together blind and sinful souls, and first</span><br>
<span class="i0">A refuge offers unto mutual guilt.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wicked hand now scorns the crooked plough;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sweat of honest labor is despised;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now sloth possession of the threshold takes;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sluggish frames their native vigor lose;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The minds in hopeless indolence are sunk;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And slavery, the crowning curse of all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Degrades and crushes poor humanity.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And thou from heaven's wrath, and ocean's waves,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That bellowed round the cloud-capped mountain-tops,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sinful brood didst save; thou, unto whom,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From the dark air and wave-encumbered hills,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The white dove brought the sign of hope renewed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sinking in the west, the shipwrecked sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His bright rays darting through the angry clouds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The dark sky painted with the lovely bow.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The race restored, to earth returned, begins anew</span><br>
<span class="i0">The same career of wickedness and lust,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With their attendant ills. Audacious man</span><br>
<span class="i0">Defies the threats of the avenging sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And to new shores and to new stars repeats</span><br>
<span class="i0">The same sad tale of infamy and woe.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And now of thee I think, the just and brave,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The Father of the faithful, and the sons</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy honored name that bore. Of thee I speak,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whom, sitting, thoughtful, in the noontide shade,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Before thy humble cottage, near the banks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That gave thy flocks both rest and nourishment,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The minds ethereal of celestial guests</span><br>
<span class="i0">With blessings greeted; and of thee, O son</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of wise Rebecca, how at eventide,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In Aran's valley sweet, and by the well,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where happy swains in friendly converse met,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou didst with Laban's daughter fall in love;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Love, that to exile long, and suffering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And to the odious yoke of servitude,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy patient soul a willing martyr led.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Oh, surely once,?for not with idle tales</span><br>
<span class="i0">And shadows, the Aonian song, and voice</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of Fame, the eager list'ners feed,?once was</span><br>
<span class="i0">This wretched earth more friendly to our race,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was more beloved and dear, and golden flew</span><br>
<span class="i0">The days, that now so laden are with care.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not that the milk, in waves of purest white,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Gushed from the rocks, and flowed along the vales;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or that the tigers mingled with the sheep,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To the same fold were led; or shepherd-boys</span><br>
<span class="i0">With playful wolves would frolic at the spring;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But of its own lot ignorant, and all</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sufferings that were in store, devoid</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of care it lived: a soft, illusive veil</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of error hid the stern realities,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cruel laws of heaven and of fate.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Life glided on, with cheerful hope content;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And tranquil, sought the haven of its rest.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">So lives, in California's forests vast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A happy race, whose life-blood is not drained</span><br>
<span class="i0">By pallid care, whose limbs are not by fierce</span><br>
<span class="i0">Disease consumed: the woods their food, their homes</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hollow rock, the streamlet of the vale</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its waters furnishes, and, unforeseen,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dark death upon them steals. Ah, how unarmed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wise Nature's happy votaries, are ye,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Against our impious audacity!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our fierce, indomitable love of gain</span><br>
<span class="i0">Your shores, your caves, your quiet woods invades;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Your minds corrupts, your bodies enervates;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And happiness, a naked fugitive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Before it drives, to earth's remotest bounds.</span></p><br>

<h2>THE LAST SONG OF SAPPHO.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Thou tranquil night, and thou, O gentle ray</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the declining moon; and thou, that o'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">The rock appearest, 'mid the silent grove,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The messenger of day; how dear ye were,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And how delightful to these eyes, while yet</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unknown the furies, and grim Fate! But now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No gentle sight can soothe this wounded soul.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then, only, can forgotten joy revive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When through the air, and o'er the trembling fields</span><br>
<span class="i0">The raging south wind whirls its clouds of dust;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when the car, the pondrous car of Jove,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Omnipotent, high-thundering o'er our heads,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A pathway cleaves athwart the dusky sky.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then would I love with storm-charged clouds to fly</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along the cliffs, along the valleys deep,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The headlong flight of frightened flocks to watch,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or hear, upon some swollen river's shore</span><br>
<span class="i0">The angry billows' loud, triumphant roar.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How beautiful thou art, O heaven divine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou, O dewy earth! Alas no part</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of all this beauty infinite, the gods</span><br>
<span class="i0">And cruel fate to wretched Sappho gave!</span><br>
<span class="i0">To thy proud realms, O Nature, I, a poor,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unwelcome guest, rejected lover, come;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To all thy varied forms of loveliness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My heart and eyes, a suppliant, lift in vain.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sun-lit shore hath smiles no more for me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor radiant morning light at heaven's gate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The birds no longer greet me with their songs,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor whispering trees with gracious messages;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And where, beneath the bending willows' shade,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The limpid stream its bosom pure displays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As I, with trembling and uncertain foot,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oppressed with grief, upon its margin pause,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The dimpled waves recoil, as in disdain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And urge their flight along the flowery plain.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">What fearful crime, what hideous excess</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have so defiled me, e'en before my birth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That heaven and fortune frown upon me thus?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wherein have I offended, as a child,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When we of evil deeds are ignorant,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thus disfigured, of the bloom of youth</span><br>
<span class="i0">Bereft, my little thread of life has from</span><br>
<span class="i0">The spindle of the unrelenting Fate</span><br>
<span class="i0">Been drawn? Alas, incautious are thy words!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Mysterious counsels all events control,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all, except our grief, is mystery.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deserted children, we were born to weep;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But why, is known to those above, alone.</span><br>
<span class="i0">O vain the cares, the hopes of earlier years!</span><br>
<span class="i0">To idle shows Jove gives eternal sway</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er human hearts. Unless in shining robes arrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">All manly deeds in arms, or art, or song,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Appeal in vain unto the vulgar throng.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I die! This wretched veil to earth I cast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for my naked soul a refuge seek</span><br>
<span class="i0">Below, and for the cruel faults atone</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of gods, the blind dispensers of events.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou, to whom I have been bound so long,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By hopeless love, and lasting faith, and by</span><br>
<span class="i0">The frenzy vain of unappeased desire,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Live, live, and if thou canst, be happy here!</span><br>
<span class="i0">My cup o'erflows with bitterness, and Jove</span><br>
<span class="i0">Has from his vase no drop of sweetness shed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For all my childhood's hopes and dreams have fled.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The happiest day the soonest fades away;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And then succeed disease, old age, the shade</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of icy death. Behold, alas! Of all</span><br>
<span class="i0">My longed-for laurels, my illusions dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The end,?the gulf of hell! My spirit proud</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must to the realm of Proserpine descend,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The Stygian shore, the night that knows no end.</span></p><br>

<h2>FIRST LOVE.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Ah, well can I the day recall, when first</span><br>
<span class="i0">The conflict fierce of love I felt, and said:</span><br>
<span class="i0">If <i>this</i> be love, how hard it is to bear!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">With eyes still fixed intent upon the ground,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I saw but <i>her</i>, whose artless innocence,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Triumphant took possession of this heart.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ah, Love, how badly hast thou governed me!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why should affection so sincere and pure,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Bring with it such desire, such suffering?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Why not serene, and full, and free from guile</span><br>
<span class="i0">But sorrow-laden, and lamenting sore,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Should joy so great into my heart descend?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O tell me, tender heart, that sufferest so,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why with that thought such anguish should be blent,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Compared with which, all other thoughts were naught?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">That thought, that ever present in the day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That in the night more vivid still appeared,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When all things round in sweet sleep seemed to rest:</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou, restless, both with joy and misery</span><br>
<span class="i0">Didst with thy constant throbbings weary so</span><br>
<span class="i0">My breast, as panting in my bed I lay.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And when worn out with grief and weariness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In sleep my eyes I closed, ah, no relief</span><br>
<span class="i0">It gave, so broken and so feverish!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How brightly from the depths of darkness, then,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lovely image rose, and my closed eyes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath their lids, their gaze upon it fed!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O what delicious impulses, diffused,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My weary frame with sweet emotion filled!</span><br>
<span class="i0">What myriad thoughts, unstable and confused,</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Were floating in my mind! As through the leaves</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of some old grove, the west wind, wandering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A long, mysterious murmur leaves behind.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And as I, silent, to their influence yield,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What saidst thou, heart, when she departed, who</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had caused thee all thy throbs, and suffering?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">No sooner had I felt within, the heat</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of love's first flame, than with it flew away</span><br>
<span class="i0">The gentle breeze, that fanned it into life.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Sleepless I lay, until the dawn of day;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The steeds, that were to leave me desolate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their hoofs were beating at my father's gate.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And I, in mute suspense, poor timid fool,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With eye that vainly would the darkness pierce,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And eager ear intent, lay, listening,</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">That voice to hear, if, for the last time, I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Might catch the accents from those lovely lips;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The voice alone; all else forever lost!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How many vulgar tones my doubtful ear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Would smite, with deep disgust inspiring me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With doubt tormented, holding hard my breath!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And when, at last, that voice into my heart</span><br>
<span class="i0">Descended, passing sweet, and when the sound</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of horses and of wheels had died away;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">In utter desolation, then, my head</span><br>
<span class="i0">I in my pillow buried, closed my eyes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And pressed my hand against my heart, and sighed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Then, listlessly, my trembling knees across</span><br>
<span class="i0">The silent chamber dragging, I exclaimed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Nothing on earth can interest me more!?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The bitter recollection cherishing</span><br>
<span class="i0">Within my breast, to every voice my heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To every face, insensible remained.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Long I remained in hopeless sorrow drowned;</span><br>
<span class="i0">As when the heavens far and wide their showers</span><br>
<span class="i0">Incessant pour upon the fields around.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nor had I, Love, thy cruel power known,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A boy of eighteen summers flown, until</span><br>
<span class="i0">That day, when I thy bitter lesson learned;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">When I each pleasure held in scorn, nor cared</span><br>
<span class="i0">The shining stars to see, or meadows green,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or felt the charm of holy morning light;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The love of glory, too, no longer found</span><br>
<span class="i0">An echo in my irresponsive breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That, once, the love of beauty with it shared.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">My favorite studies I neglected quite;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And those things vain appeared, compared with which,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I used to think all other pleasures vain.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ah! how could I have changed so utterly?</span><br>
<span class="i0">How could one passion all the rest destroy?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Indeed, what helpless mortals are we all!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">My heart my only comfort was, and with</span><br>
<span class="i0">That heart, in conference perpetual,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A constant watch upon my grief to keep.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">My eye still sought the ground, or in itself</span><br>
<span class="i0">Absorbed, shrank from encountering the glance</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of lovely or unlovely countenance;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The stainless image fearing to disturb,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So faithfully reflected in my breast;</span><br>
<span class="i0">As winds disturb the mirror of the lake.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And that regret, that I could not enjoy</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such happiness, which weighs upon the mind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And turns to poison pleasure that has passed,</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Did still its thorn within my bosom lodge,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As I the past recalled; but shame, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Left not its cruel sting within this heart.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">To heaven, to you, ye gentle souls, I swear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No base desire intruded on my thought;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But with a pure and sacred flame I burned.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">That flame still lives, and that affection pure;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still in my thought that lovely image breathes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From which, save heavenly, I no other joy,</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Have ever known; my only comfort, now!</span></p><br>

<h2>THE LONELY SPARROW.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Thou from the top of yonder antique tower,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O lonely sparrow, wandering, hast gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy song repeating till the day is done,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And through this valley strays the harmony.</span><br>
<span class="i0">How Spring rejoices in the fields around,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And fills the air with light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So that the heart is melted at the sight!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hark to the bleating flocks, the lowing herds!</span><br>
<span class="i0">In sweet content, the other birds</span><br>
<span class="i0">Through the free sky in emulous circles wheel,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In pure enjoyment of their happy time:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou, pensive, gazest on the scene apart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor wilt thou join them in the merry round;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shy playmate, thou for mirth hast little heart;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with thy plaintive music, dost consume</span><br>
<span class="i0">Both of the year, and of thy life, the bloom.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Alas, how much my ways</span><br>
<span class="i0">Resemble thine! The laughter and the sport,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That fill with glee our youthful days,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thee, O love, who art youth's brother still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too oft the bitter sigh of later years,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I care not for; I know not why,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But from them ever distant fly:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Here in my native place,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As if of alien race,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My spring of life I like a hermit pass.</span><br>
<span class="i0">This day, that to the evening now gives way,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is in our town an ancient holiday.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hark, through the air, that voice of festal bell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">While rustic guns in frequent thunders sound,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Reverberated from the hills around.</span><br>
<span class="i0">In festal robes arrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The neighboring youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their houses leaving, o'er the roads are spread;</span><br>
<span class="i0">They pleasant looks exchange, and in their hearts</span><br>
<span class="i0">Rejoice. I, lonely, in this distant spot,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along the country wandering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Postpone all pleasure and delight</span><br>
<span class="i0">To some more genial time: meanwhile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As through the sunny air around I gaze,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My brow is smitten by his rays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As after such a day serene,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dropping behind yon distant hills,</span><br>
<span class="i0">He vanishes, and seems to say,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thus all happy youth must pass away.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou, lonely little bird, when thou</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast reached the evening of the days</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy stars assign to thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wilt surely not regret thy ways;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For all thy wishes are</span><br>
<span class="i0">Obedient to Nature's law. But ah!</span><br>
<span class="i0">If I, in spite of all my prayers,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Am doomed the hateful threshold of old age</span><br>
<span class="i0">To cross, when these dull eyes will give</span><br>
<span class="i0">No response to another's heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The world to them a void will be,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each day become more full of misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How then, will this, my wish appear</span><br>
<span class="i0">In those dark hours, that dungeon drear?</span><br>
<span class="i0">My blighted youth, my sore distress,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, will <i>then</i> seem happiness!</span></p><br>

<h2>THE INFINITE.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">This lonely hill to me was ever dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This hedge, which shuts from view so large a part</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the remote horizon. As I sit</span><br>
<span class="i0">And gaze, absorbed, I in my thought conceive</span><br>
<span class="i0">The boundless spaces that beyond it range,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The silence supernatural, and rest</span><br>
<span class="i0">Profound; and for a moment I am calm.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And as I listen to the wind, that through</span><br>
<span class="i0">These trees is murmuring, its plaintive voice</span><br>
<span class="i0">I with that infinite compare;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And things eternal I recall, and all</span><br>
<span class="i0">The seasons dead, and this, that round me lives,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And utters its complaint. Thus wandering</span><br>
<span class="i0">My thought in this immensity is drowned;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sweet to me is shipwreck on this sea.</span></p><br>

<h2>THE EVENING OF THE HOLIDAY.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">The night is mild and clear, and without wind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And o'er the roofs, and o'er the gardens round</span><br>
<span class="i0">The moon shines soft, and from afar reveals</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each mountain-peak serene. O lady, mine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hushed now is every path, and few and dim</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lamps that glimmer through the balconies.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou sleepest! in thy quiet rooms, how light</span><br>
<span class="i0">And easy is thy sleep! No care thy heart</span><br>
<span class="i0">Consumes; and little dost thou know or think,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How deep a wound thou in my heart hast made.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou sleepest; I to yonder heaven turn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That seems to greet me with a loving smile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And to that Nature old, omnipotent,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That doomed me still to suffer. ?I to thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">All hope deny,? she said, ?e'en hope; nor may</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those eyes of thine e'er shine, save through their tears.?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">This was a holiday; its pleasures o'er,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou seek'st repose; and happy in thy dreams</span><br>
<span class="i0">Recallest those whom thou hast pleased to-day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And those who have pleased thee: not I, indeed,?</span><br>
<span class="i0">I hoped it not,?unto thy thoughts occur.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, I ask, how much of life remains</span><br>
<span class="i0">To me; and on the earth I cast myself,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And cry, and groan. How wretched are my days,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And still so young! Hark, on the road I hear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not far away, the solitary song</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of workman, who returns at this late hour,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In merry mood, unto his humble home;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in my heart a cruel pang I feel,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At thought, how all things earthly pass away,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And leave no trace behind. This festal day</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hath fled; a working-day now follows it,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all, alike, are swept away by Time.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where is the glory of the antique nations now?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where now the fame of our great ancestors?</span><br>
<span class="i0">The empire vast of Rome, the clash of arms?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now all is peace and silence, all the world</span><br>
<span class="i0">At rest; their very names are heard no more.</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'en from my earliest years, when we</span><br>
<span class="i0">Expect so eagerly a holiday,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The moment it was past, I sought my couch,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wakeful and sad; and at the midnight hour,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When I the song heard of some passer-by,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That slowly in the distance died away,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The same deep anguish felt I in my heart.</span></p><br>

<h2>TO THE MOON.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">O lovely moon, how well do I recall</span><br>
<span class="i0">The time,?'tis just a year?when up this hill</span><br>
<span class="i0">I came, in my distress, to gaze at thee:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou suspended wast o'er yonder grove,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As now thou art, which thou with light dost fill.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But stained with mist, and tremulous, appeared</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy countenance to me, because my eyes</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were filled with tears, that could not be suppressed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For, oh, my life was wretched, wearisome,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And <i>is</i> so still, unchanged, belov?d moon!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet this recollection pleases me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This computation of my sorrow's age.</span><br>
<span class="i0">How pleasant is it, in the days of youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When hope a long career before it hath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And memories are few, upon the past</span><br>
<span class="i0">To dwell, though sad, and though the sadness last!</span></p><br>

<h2>THE DREAM.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">It was the morning; through the shutters closed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along the balcony, the earliest rays</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of sunlight my dark room were entering;</span><br>
<span class="i0">When, at the time that sleep upon our eyes</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its softest and most grateful shadows casts,</span><br>
<span class="i0">There stood beside me, looking in my face,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The image dear of her, who taught me first</span><br>
<span class="i0">To love, then left me to lament her loss.</span><br>
<span class="i0">To me she seemed not dead, but sad, with such</span><br>
<span class="i0">A countenance as the unhappy wear.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her right hand near my head she sighing placed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Dost thou still live,? she said to me, ?and dost</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou still remember what we <i>were</i> and are??</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I replied: ?Whence comest thou, and how,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beloved and beautiful? Oh how, how I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have grieved, still grieve for thee! Nor did I think</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou e'er couldst know it more; and oh, that thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">My sorrow rendered more disconsolate!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But art thou now again to leave me?</span><br>
<span class="i0">I fear so. Say, what hath befallen thee?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Art thou the same? What preys upon thee thus??</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Oblivion weighs upon thy thoughts, and sleep</span><br>
<span class="i0">Envelops them,? she answered; ?I am dead,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And many months have passed, since last we met.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What grief oppressed me, as these words I heard!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And she continued: ?In the flower of youth</span><br>
<span class="i0">Cut off, when life is sweetest, and before</span><br>
<span class="i0">The heart that lesson sad and sure hath learnt,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The utter vanity of human hope!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sick man may e'en covet, as a boon,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That which withdraws him from all suffering;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But to the young, Death comes, disconsolate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hard the fate of hope, that in the grave</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is quenched! And yet, how vain that knowledge is,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That Nature from the inexperienced hides!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And a blind sorrow is to be preferred</span><br>
<span class="i0">To wisdom premature!???Hush, hush!? I cried,</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Unhappy one, and dear! My heart is crushed</span><br>
<span class="i0">With these thy words! And art thou dead, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O my beloved? and am I still alive?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And was it, then, in heaven decreed, that this,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy tender body the last damps of death</span><br>
<span class="i0">Should feel, and my poor, wretched frame remain</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unharmed? Oh, often, often as I think</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thou no longer livest, and that I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shall never see thee on the earth again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Incredible it seems! Alas, alas!</span><br>
<span class="i0">What <i>is</i> this thing, that they call death? Oh, would</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I, this day, the mystery could solve,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And my defenceless head withdraw from Fate's</span><br>
<span class="i0">Relentless hate! I still am young, and still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Feel all the blight and misery of age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which I so dread; and distant far it seems;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, ah, how little different from age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The flower of my years!???We both were born,?</span><br>
<span class="i0">She said, ?to weep; unhappy were our lives,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And heaven took pleasure in our sufferings.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Oh if my eyes with tears,? I added, ?then,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My face with pallor veiled thou seest, for loss</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of thee, and anguish weighing on my heart;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Tell me, was any spark of pity or of love</span><br>
<span class="i0">For the poor lover kindled in thy heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">While thou didst live? I, then, between my hope</span><br>
<span class="i0">And my despair, passed weary nights and days;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And now, my mind is with vain doubts oppressed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh if but once compassion smote thee for</span><br>
<span class="i0">My darkened life, conceal it not from me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I pray thee; let the memory console me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Since of their future our young days were robbed!?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And she: ?Be comforted, unhappy one!</span><br>
<span class="i0">I was not churlish of my pity whilst</span><br>
<span class="i0">I lived, and am not now, myself so wretched!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, do not chide this most unhappy child!?</span><br>
<span class="i0">?By all our sufferings, and by the love</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which preys upon me,? I exclaimed, ?and by</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our youth, and by the hope that faded from</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our lives, O let me, dearest, touch thy hand!?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sweetly, sadly, she extended it.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And while I covered it with kisses, while</span><br>
<span class="i0">With sorrow and with rapture quivering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I to my panting bosom fondly pressed it,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With fervent passion glowed my face and breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My trembling voice refused its utterance,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all things swam before my sight; when she,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her eyes fixed tenderly on mine, replied:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?And dost thou, then, forget, dear friend, that I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Am of my beauty utterly deprived?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And vainly thou, unhappy one, dost yield</span><br>
<span class="i0">To passion's transports. Now, a last farewell!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our wretched minds, our feeble bodies, too,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Eternally are parted. Thou to me</span><br>
<span class="i0">No longer livest, nevermore shall live.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Fate hath annulled the faith that thou hast sworn.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then, in my anguish as I seemed to cry</span><br>
<span class="i0">Aloud, convulsed, my eyes o'erflowing with</span><br>
<span class="i0">The tears of utter, helpless misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I started from my sleep. The image still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was seen, and in the sun's uncertain light</span><br>
<span class="i0">Above my couch she seemed to linger still.</span></p><br>

<h2>THE LONELY LIFE.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">The morning rain, when, from her coop released,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hen, exulting, flaps her wings, when from</span><br>
<span class="i0">The balcony the husbandman looks forth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when the rising sun his trembling rays</span><br>
<span class="i0">Darts through the falling drops, against my roof</span><br>
<span class="i0">And windows gently beating, wakens me.</span><br>
<span class="i0">I rise, and grateful, bless the flying clouds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cheerful twitter of the early birds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The smiling fields, and the refreshing air.</span><br>
<span class="i0">For I of you, unhappy city walls,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Enough have seen and known; where hatred still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Companion is to grief; and grieving still</span><br>
<span class="i0">I live, and so shall die, and that, how soon!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But here some pity Nature shows, though small,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Once in this spot to me so courteous!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou, too, O Nature, turn'st away thy gaze</span><br>
<span class="i0">From misery; thou, too, thy sympathy</span><br>
<span class="i0">Withholding from the suffering and the sad,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dost homage pay to royal happiness.</span><br>
<span class="i0">No friend in heaven, on earth, the wretched hath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No refuge, save his trusty dagger's edge.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sometimes I sit in perfect solitude,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon a hill, that overlooks a lake,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That is encircled quite with silent trees.</span><br>
<span class="i0">There, when the sun his mid-day course hath reached,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His tranquil face he in a mirror sees:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor grass nor leaf is shaken by the wind;</span><br>
<span class="i0">There is no ripple on the wave, no chirp</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of cricket, rustling wing of bird in bush,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor hum of butterfly; no motion, voice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or far or near, is either seen or heard.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its shores are locked in quiet most profound;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So that myself, the world I quite forget,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As motionless I sit; my limbs appear</span><br>
<span class="i0">To lie dissolved, of breath and sense deprived;</span><br>
<span class="i0">As if, in immemorial rest, they seemed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Confounded with the silent scene around.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O love, O love, long since, thou from this breast</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast flown, that was so warm, so ardent, once.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Misfortune in her cold and cruel grasp</span><br>
<span class="i0">Has held it fast, and it to ice has turned,</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'en in the flower of my youth. The time</span><br>
<span class="i0">I well recall, when thou this heart didst fill;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That sweet, irrevocable time it was,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When this unhappy scene of life unto</span><br>
<span class="i0">The ardent gaze of youth reveals itself,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Expands, and wears the smile of Paradise.</span><br>
<span class="i0">How throbs the heart within the boyish breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By virgin hope and fond desire impelled!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wretched dupe for life's hard work prepares,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As if it were a dance, or merry game.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But when <i>I</i> first, O love, thy presence felt,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Misfortune had already crushed my life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And these poor eyes with constant tears were filled.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet if, at times, upon the sun-lit slopes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At silent dawn, or when, in broad noonday,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The roofs and hills and fields are shining bright,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I of some lonely maiden meet the gaze;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or when, in silence of the summer night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My wandering steps arresting, I before</span><br>
<span class="i0">The houses of the village pause, to gaze</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the lonely scene, and hear the voice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So clear and cheerful, of the maiden, who,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her ditty chanting, in her quiet room,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her daily task protracts into the night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, then this stony heart will throb once more;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But soon, alas, its lethargy returns,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For all things sweet are strangers to this breast!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Belov?d moon, beneath whose tranquil rays</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hares dance in the groves, and at the dawn</span><br>
<span class="i0">The huntsman, vexed at heart, beholds the tracks</span><br>
<span class="i0">Confused and intricate, that from their forms</span><br>
<span class="i0">His steps mislead; hail, thou benignant Queen</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of Night! How unpropitious fall thy rays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Among the cliffs and thickets, or within</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deserted buildings, on the gleaming steel</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of robber pale, who with attentive ear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the distant noise of horses and</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of wheels, is listening, or the tramp of feet</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the silent road; then, suddenly,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With sound of arms, and hoarse, harsh voice, and look</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of death, the traveller's heart doth chill,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whom he half-dead, and naked, shortly leaves</span><br>
<span class="i0">Among the rocks. How unpropitious, too,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is thy bright light along the city streets,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the worthless paramour, who picks</span><br>
<span class="i0">His way, close to the walls, in anxious search</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of friendly shade, and halts, and dreads the sight</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of blazing lamps, and open balconies.</span><br>
<span class="i0">To evil spirits unpropitious still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To <i>me</i> thy face will ever seem benign,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along these heights, where nought save smiling hills,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And spacious fields, thou offer'st to my view.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet it was my wayward custom once,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though I was innocent, thy gracious ray</span><br>
<span class="i0">To chide, amid the haunts of men, whene'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">It would my face to them betray, and when</span><br>
<span class="i0">It would their faces unto me reveal.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now will I, grateful, sing its constant praise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When I behold thee, sailing through the clouds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or when, mild sovereign of the realms of air,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou lookest down on this, our vale of tears.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Me wilt thou oft behold, mute wanderer</span><br>
<span class="i0">Among the groves, along the verdant banks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or seated on the grass, content enough,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If heart and breath are left me, for a sigh!</span></p><br>

<h2>CONSALVO.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Approaching now the end of his abode</span><br>
<span class="i0">On earth, Consalvo lay; complaining once,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of his hard fate, but now quite reconciled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When, in the midst of his fifth lustre, o'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">His head oblivion, so longed-for, hung.</span><br>
<span class="i0">As for some time, so, on his dying day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">He lay, abandoned by his dearest friends:</span><br>
<span class="i0">For in the world, few friends to <i>him</i> will cling,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who shows that he is weary of the world.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet <i>she</i> was at his side, by pity led,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In his lone wretchedness to comfort him,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who was alone and ever in his thought;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Elvira, for her loveliness renowned;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And knowing well her power; that a look,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A single sweet and gracious word from <i>her</i>,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A thousand-fold repeated in the heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Devoted, of her hapless lover, still</span><br>
<span class="i0">His consolation and support had been,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Although no word of love had she from him</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'er heard. For ever in his soul the power</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of great desire had been rebuked and crushed</span><br>
<span class="i0">By sovereign fear. So great a child and slave</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had he become, through his excess of love!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But death at last the cruel silence broke;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For being by sure signs convinced, that now</span><br>
<span class="i0">The day of his deliverance had come,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her white hand taking, as she was about</span><br>
<span class="i0">To leave, and gently pressing it, he said:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Thou goest; it is time for thee to go;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Farewell, Elvira! I shall never see</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thee more; too well I know it; so, farewell!</span><br>
<span class="i0">I thank thee for thy gentle sympathy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So far as my poor lips my thanks can speak.</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>He</i> will reward thee, who alone has power,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If heaven e'er rewards the merciful.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Pale turned the fair one at these words; a sigh</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her bosom heaved; for e'en a stranger's heart</span><br>
<span class="i0">A throb responsive feels, when she departs,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And says farewell forever. Fain would she</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have contradicted him, the near approach</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of fate concealing from the dying man.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But he, her thought anticipating, said:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Ah, much desired, as well thou knowest, death,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Much prayed for, and not dreaded, comes to me;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nay, joyful seems to me this fatal day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Save for the thought of losing thee forever;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, forever do I part from thee!</span><br>
<span class="i0">In saying this my heart is rent in twain.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those eyes I shall no more behold, nor hear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy voice. But, O Elvira, say, before</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou leavest me forever, wilt thou not</span><br>
<span class="i0">One kiss bestow? A single kiss, in all</span><br>
<span class="i0">My life? A favor asked, who can deny</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto a dying man? Of the sweet gift</span><br>
<span class="i0">I ne'er can boast, so near my end, whose lips</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-day will by a stranger's hand be closed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forever.? Saying this, with a deep sigh,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her hand beloved he with his cold lips pressed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The lovely woman stood irresolute,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thoughtful, for a moment, with her look,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In which a thousand charms were radiant,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Intent on that of the unhappy man,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where the last tear was glittering. Nor would</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her heart permit her to refuse with scorn</span><br>
<span class="i0">His wish, and by refusal, make more sad</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sad farewell; but she compassion took</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon his love, which she had known so long;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And that celestial face, that mouth, which he</span><br>
<span class="i0">So long had coveted, which had, for years,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The burden been of all his dreams and sighs,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Close bringing unto his, so sad and wan,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Discolored by his mortal agony,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Kiss after kiss, all goodness, with a look</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of deep compassion, on the trembling lips</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the enraptured lover she impressed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">What didst thou then become? How in thy eyes</span><br>
<span class="i0">Appeared life, death, and all thy suffering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Consalvo, in thy flight now pausing? He</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hand, which still he held, of his beloved</span><br>
<span class="i0">Elvira, placing on his heart, whose last</span><br>
<span class="i0">Pulsations love with death was sharing, said:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Elvira, my Elvira, am I still</span><br>
<span class="i0">On earth? Those lips, were they thy lips? O, say!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And do I press thy hand? Alas, it seems</span><br>
<span class="i0">A dead man's vision, or a dream, or thing</span><br>
<span class="i0">Incredible! How much, Elvira, O,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How much I owe to death! Long has my love</span><br>
<span class="i0">Been known to thee, and unto others, for</span><br>
<span class="i0">True love cannot be hidden on the earth.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too manifest it was to thee, in looks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In acts, in my unhappy countenance,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But never in my words. For then, and now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forever would the passion infinite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That rules my heart, be silent, had not death</span><br>
<span class="i0">With courage filled it. I shall die content;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Henceforth, with destiny, no more regret</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I e'er saw the light. I have not lived</span><br>
<span class="i0">In vain, now that my lips have been allowed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy lips to press. Nay, happy I esteem</span><br>
<span class="i0">My lot. Two precious things the world still gives</span><br>
<span class="i0">To mortals, Love and Death. To one, heaven guides</span><br>
<span class="i0">Me now, in youth; and in the other, I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Am fortunate. Ah, hadst thou once, but once,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Responded to my long-enduring love,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To my changed eyes this earth for evermore</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had been transformed into a Paradise.</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'en to old age, detestable old age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Could I have been resigned and reconciled.</span><br>
<span class="i0">To bear its heavy load, the memory</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of one transcendent moment had sufficed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When I was happier than the happiest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, ah, such bliss supreme the envious gods</span><br>
<span class="i0">To earthly natures ne'er have given! Love</span><br>
<span class="i0">In such excess ne'er leads to happiness.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, thy love to win, I would have borne</span><br>
<span class="i0">The tortures of the executioner;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have faced the rack and fagot, dauntlessly;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Would from thy loving arms have rushed into</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fearful flames of hell, with cheerfulness.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">?Elvira, O Elvira, happy he,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beyond all mortal happiness, on whom</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou dost the smile of love bestow! And next</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is he, who can lay down his life for thee!</span><br>
<span class="i0">It <i>is</i> permitted, it is not a dream,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As I, alas, have always fancied it,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To man, on earth true happiness to find.</span><br>
<span class="i0">I knew it well, the day I looked on thee.</span><br>
<span class="i0">That look to me, indeed, has fatal been:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, I could not bring myself, midst all</span><br>
<span class="i0">My sufferings, that cruel day to blame.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">?Now live, Elvira, happy, and adorn</span><br>
<span class="i0">The world with thy fair countenance. None e'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will love thee as I loved thee. Such a love</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will ne'er be seen on earth. How much, alas,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How long a time by poor Consalvo hast</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou been with sighs and bitter tears invoked!</span><br>
<span class="i0">How, when I heard thy name, have I turned pale!</span><br>
<span class="i0">How have I trembled, and been sick at heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As timidly thy threshold I approached,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At that angelic voice, at sight of that</span><br>
<span class="i0">Fair brow, I, who now tremble not at death!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But breath and life no longer will respond</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the voice of love. The time has passed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor can I e'er this happy day recall.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Farewell, Elvira! With its vital spark</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy image so beloved is from my heart</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forever fading. Oh, farewell! If this,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My love offend thee not, to-morrow eve</span><br>
<span class="i0">One sigh wilt thou bestow upon my bier.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">He ceased; and soon he lost his consciousness:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ere evening came, his first, his only day</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of happiness had faded from his sight.</span></p><br>

<h2>TO THE BELOVED.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Beauty beloved, who hast my heart inspired,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Seen from afar, or with thy face concealed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Save, when in visions of the night revealed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or seen in daydreams bright,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When all the fields are filled with light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Nature's smile is sweet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Say, hast thou blessed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Some golden age of innocence,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And floatest, now, a shadow, o'er the earth?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or hath Fate's envious doom</span><br>
<span class="i0">Reserved thee for some happier day to come?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">To see thee e'er alive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No hope remains to me;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unless perchance, when from this body free,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My wandering spirit, lone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er some new path, to some new world hath flown.</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'en here, at first, I, at the dawn</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this, my day, so dreary and forlorn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sought thee, to guide me on my weary way:</span><br>
<span class="i0">But none on earth resembles thee. E'en if</span><br>
<span class="i0">One were in looks and acts and words thy peer,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though like thee, she less lovely would appear.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Amidst the deepest grief</span><br>
<span class="i0">That fate hath e'er to human lot assigned,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Could one but love thee on this earth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alive, and such as my thought painteth thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">He would be happy in his misery:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I most clearly see, how, still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As in my earliest days,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy love would make me cling to virtue's ways.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto <i>my</i> grief heaven hath no comfort brought;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet with thee, this mortal life would seem</span><br>
<span title="Original started new stanza here" class="i0">Like that in heaven, of which we fondly dream.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Along the valleys where is heard</span><br>
<span class="i0">The song of the laborious husbandman,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And where I sit and moan</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er youth's illusions gone;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along the hills, where I recall with tears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The vanished joys and hopes of earlier years,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At thought of thee, my heart revives again.</span><br>
<span class="i0">O could I still thy image dear retain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In this dark age, and in this baleful air!</span><br>
<span class="i0">To loss of thee, O let me be resigned,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in thy image still some comfort find!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">If thou art one of those</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ideas eternal, which the Eternal Mind</span><br>
<span class="i0">Refused in earthly form to clothe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor would subject unto the pain and strife</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this, our frail and dreary life;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or if thou hast a mansion fair,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Amid the boundless realms of space,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That lighted is by a more genial sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And breathest there a more benignant air;</span><br>
<span class="i0">From here, where brief and wretched are our days,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Receive thy humble lover's hymn of praise!</span></p><br>

<h2>TO COUNT CARLO PEPOLI.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">This wearisome and this distressing sleep</span><br>
<span class="i0">That we call life, O how dost thou support,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My Pepoli? With what hopes feedest thou</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy heart? Say in what thoughts, and in what deeds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Agreeable or sad, dost thou invest</span><br>
<span class="i0">The idleness thy ancestors bequeathed</span><br>
<span class="i0">To thee, a dull and heavy heritage?</span><br>
<span class="i0">All life, indeed, in every walk of life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is idleness, if we may give that name</span><br>
<span class="i0">To every work achieved, or effort made,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That has no worthy aim in view, or fails</span><br>
<span class="i0">That aim to reach. And if you idle call</span><br>
<span class="i0">The busy crew, that daily we behold,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From tranquil morn unto the dewy eve,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behind the plough, or tending plants and flocks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Because they live simply to keep alive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And life is worthless for itself alone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The honest truth you speak. His nights and days</span><br>
<span class="i0">The pilot spends in idleness; the toil</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sweat in workshops are but idleness;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The soldier's vigils, perils of the field,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The eager merchant's cares are idle all;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Because true happiness, for which alone</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our mortal nature longs and strives, no man,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or for himself, or others, e'er acquires</span><br>
<span class="i0">Through toil or sweat, through peril, or through care.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet for this fierce desire, which mortals still</span><br>
<span class="i0">From the beginning of the world have felt,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But ever felt in vain, for happiness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By way of soothing remedy devised,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nature, in this unhappy life of ours,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had manifold necessities prepared,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not without thought or labor satisfied;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So that the days, though ever sad, less dull</span><br>
<span class="i0">Might seem unto the human family;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And this desire, bewildered and confused,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Might have less power to agitate the heart.</span><br>
<span class="i0">So, too, the various families of brutes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who have, no less than we, and vainly, too,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Desire for happiness; but they, intent</span><br>
<span class="i0">On that which is essential to their life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Consume their days more pleasantly, by far,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor chide, with us, the dulness of the hours.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But <i>we</i>, who unto other hands commit</span><br>
<span class="i0">The furnishing of our immediate wants,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have a necessity more grave to meet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For which no other ever can provide,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With ennui laden, and with suffering;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The stern necessity of killing time;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That cruel, obstinate necessity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From which, nor hoarded gold, nor wealth of flocks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor fertile fields, nor sumptuous palaces,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor purple robes, the race of man can save.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And if one, scorning such a barren life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hating to behold the light of day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Turns not a homicidal hand upon</span><br>
<span class="i0">Himself, anticipating sluggish Fate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For the sharp sting of unappeased desire,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That vainly calls for happiness, he seeks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In desperate chase, on every side, in vain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A thousand inefficient remedies,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In lieu of that, which Nature gives to all.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">One to his dress devotes himself, and hair,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His gait and gesture and the learned lore</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of horses, carriages, to crowded halls,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To thronged piazzas, and to gardens gay;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Another gives his nights and days to games,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And feasts, and dances with the reigning belles:</span><br>
<span class="i0">A smile perpetual is on his lips;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But in his breast, alas, stern and severe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like adamantine column motionless,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Eternal ennui sits, against whose might</span><br>
<span class="i0">Avail not vigorous youth, nor prattle fond</span><br>
<span class="i0">That falls from rosy lips, nor tender glance</span><br>
<span class="i0">That trembles in two dark and lustrous eyes;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The most bewildering of mortal things,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Most precious gift of heaven unto man.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Another, as if hoping to escape</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sad destiny, in changing lands and climes</span><br>
<span class="i0">His days consuming, wandering o'er sea</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hills, the whole earth traverses; each spot</span><br>
<span class="i0">That Nature, in her infinite domain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To restless man hath made accessible,</span><br>
<span class="i0">He visits in his wanderings. Alas,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Black care is seated on the lofty prow;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath each clime, each sky, he asks in vain</span><br>
<span class="i0">For happiness; sadness still lives and reigns.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Another in the cruel deeds of war</span><br>
<span class="i0">Prefers to pass his hours, and dips his hand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For his diversion, in his brother's blood:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Another in his neighbor's misery</span><br>
<span class="i0">His comfort finds, and artfully contrives</span><br>
<span class="i0">To kill the time, in making others sad.</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>This</i> man still walks in wisdom's ways, or art</span><br>
<span class="i0">Pursues; <i>that</i> tramples on the people's rights,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At home, abroad; the ancient rest disturbs</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of distant shores, on fraudful gain intent,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With cruel war, or sharp diplomacy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so his destined part of life consumes.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thee a more gentle wish, a care more sweet</span><br>
<span class="i0">Leads and controls, still in the flower of youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In the fair April of thy days, to most</span><br>
<span class="i0">A time so pleasant, heaven's choicest gift;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But heavy, bitter, wearisome to <i>him</i></span><br>
<span class="i0">Who has no country. Thee the love of song</span><br>
<span class="i0">Impels, and of portraying in thy speech</span><br>
<span class="i0">The beauty, that so seldom in the world</span><br>
<span class="i0">Appears and fades so soon, and <i>that</i>, more rare</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which fond imagination, kinder far</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than Nature, or than heaven, so bounteously</span><br>
<span class="i0">For our entranced, deluded souls provides.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, fortunate a thousand-fold is he,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who loses not his fancy's freshness as</span><br>
<span class="i0">The years roll by; whom envious Fate permits</span><br>
<span class="i0">To keep eternal sunshine in his heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, in his ripe and his declining years,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As was his custom in his glorious youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In his deep thought enhances Nature's charms,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Gives life to death, and to the desert, bloom.</span><br>
<span class="i0">May heaven this fortune give to thee; and may</span><br>
<span class="i0">The spark that now so warms thy breast, make thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">In thy old age a votary of song!</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> feel no more the sweet illusions of</span><br>
<span class="i0">That happy time; those charming images</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have faded from my eyes, that I so loved,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And which, unto my latest hour, will be</span><br>
<span class="i0">Remembered still, with hopeless sighs and tears.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when this breast to all things has become</span><br>
<span class="i0">Insensible and cold, nor the sweet smile</span><br>
<span class="i0">And rest profound of lonely sun-lit plains,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor cheerful morning song of birds in spring,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor moonlight soft, that rests on hills and fields,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath the limpid sky, will move my heart;</span><br>
<span class="i0">When every beauty, both of Nature, and</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of Art, to me will be inanimate</span><br>
<span class="i0">And mute; each tender feeling, lofty thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unknown and strange; my only comfort, then,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Poor beggar, must I find in studies more</span><br>
<span class="i0">Severe; to them, thenceforward, must devote</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wretched remnant of unhappy life:</span><br>
<span class="i0">The bitter truth must I investigate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The destinies mysterious, alike</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of mortal and immortal things;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For what was suffering humanity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Bowed down beneath the weight of misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Created; to what final goal are Fate</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Nature urging it; to whom can our</span><br>
<span class="i0">Great sorrow any pleasure, profit give;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath what laws and orders, to what end,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mighty Universe revolves?the theme</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of wise men's praise, to <i>me</i> a mystery?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I in these speculations will consume</span><br>
<span class="i0">My idleness; because the truth, when known,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though sad, has yet its charms. And if, at times,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The truth discussing, my opinions should</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unwelcome be, or not be understood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I shall not grieve, indeed, because in me</span><br>
<span class="i0">The love of fame will be extinguished quite;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of fame, that idol frivolous and blind;</span><br>
<span class="i0">More blind by far than Fortune, or than Love.</span></p><br>

<h2>THE RESURRECTION.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">I thought I had forever lost,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, though still so young,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The tender joys and sorrows all,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That unto youth belong;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The sufferings sweet, the impulses</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Our inmost hearts that warm;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whatever gives this life of ours</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Its value and its charm.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">What sore laments, what bitter tears</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er my sad state I shed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When first I felt from my cold heart</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Its gentle pains had fled!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Its throbs I felt no more; my love</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Within me seemed to die;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor from my frozen, senseless breast</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Escaped a single sigh!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I wept o'er my sad, hapless lot;</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of life seemed lost;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The earth an arid wilderness,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Locked in eternal frost;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The day how dreary, and the night</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;How dull, and dark, and lone!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The moon for me no brightness had,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;No star in heaven shone.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And yet the old love was the cause</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the tears I shed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still in my inmost breast I felt</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart was not yet dead.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">My weary fancy still would crave</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The images it loved,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And its capricious longings still</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A source of sorrow proved.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But e'en that lingering spark of grief</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was soon within me spent,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I the strength no longer had</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To utter a lament.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And there I lay, stunned, stupefied,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor asked for comfort more;</span><br>
<span class="i0">My heart to hopeless, blank despair</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself had given o'er.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How changed, alas, was I from him</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who once with passion thrilled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose ardent soul was ever, once,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweet illusions filled!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The swallow to my window, still,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Would come, to greet the dawn;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But his sweet song no echo found</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In my poor heart, forlorn.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nor pleased me more, in autumn gray,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the hill-side lone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cheerful vesper-bell, or light</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the departing sun.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">In vain the evening star I saw</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the silent vale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And vainly warbled in the grove</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintive nightingale.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And you, ye furtive glances, bright,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;From gentle eyes that rove,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sweet, the gracious messages</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of first immortal Love;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The soft, white hand, that tenderly</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;My own hand seemed to woo;</span><br>
<span class="i0">All, all your magic spells were vain,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;My torpor to subdue.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Of every pleasure quite bereft,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad but of tranquil mien;</span><br>
<span class="i0">A state of perfect littleness,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with a face serene;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Save for the lingering wish, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In death to sink to rest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The force of all desire was spent</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In my exhausted breast.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">As some poor, feeble wanderer,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With age and sorrow bent,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The April of my years, alas,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus listlessly I spent;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thus listlessly, thus wearily,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst thou consume, O heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those golden days, ineffable,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;So swiftly that depart.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0"><i>Who</i>, from this heavy, heedless rest</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakens me again?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What new, what magic power is this,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel within me reign?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ye motions sweet, ye images,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye throbs, illusions blest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, no,?ye are not then shut out</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever from this breast?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The glorious light of golden days</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ye again unfold?</span><br>
<span class="i0">The old affections that I lost,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I once more behold?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Now, as I gaze upon the sky,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the verdant fields,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each thing with sorrow me inspires,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And each a pleasure yields.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The mountain, forest, and the shore</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more my heart rejoice;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fountain speaks to me once more,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea hath found a voice.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Who, after all this apathy,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Restores to me my tears?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each moment, as I look around,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;How changed the world appears!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Hath hope, perchance, O my poor heart,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beguiled thee of thy pain?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, no, the gracious smile of hope</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I ne'er shall see again.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nature bestowed these impulses,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And these illusions blest;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their inborn influence, in me,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By suffering was suppressed;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But not annulled, not overcome</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By cruel blows of Fate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor by the inauspicious frown</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Truth, importunate!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I know she has no sympathy</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For fond imaginings;</span><br>
<span class="i0">I know that Nature, too, is deaf,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heeds our sufferings;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">That for our <i>good</i> she nothing cares,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <i>being</i>, only heeds;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with the sight of our distress</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wild caprices feeds.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I know the poor man pleads in vain,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For others' sympathy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That scornfully, or heedlessly,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;All from his presence flee;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">That both for genius and for worth,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;This age has no respect;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That all who cherish lofty aims</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Are left to cold neglect.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And you, ye eyes so tremulous</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With lustre all divine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I know how false your splendors are,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no true love doth shine.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">No love mysterious and profound</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumes you with its glow;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor gleams one spark of genial fire</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath that breast of snow.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nay, it is wont to laugh to scorn</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another's tender pain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fervent flame of heavenly love</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To treat with cold disdain.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Yet I with thankfulness once more</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The old illusions greet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And feel, with shock of pleased surprise,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart within me beat.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">To thee alone this force renewed,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;This vital power I owe;</span><br>
<span class="i0">From thee alone, my faithful heart,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;My only comforts flow.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I feel it is the destiny</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every noble mind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In Fate, in Fortune, Beauty, and the World,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;An enemy to find:</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But while thou liv'st, nor yield'st to Fate,</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Contending without fear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I will not tax with cruelty</span><br>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The power that placed me here.</span></p><br>

<h2>TO SYLVIA.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">O Sylvia, dost thou remember still</span><br>
<span class="i0">That period of thy mortal life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When beauty so bewildering</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shone in thy laughing, glancing eyes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As thou, so merry, yet so wise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Youth's threshold then wast entering?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How did the quiet rooms,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the paths around,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With thy perpetual song resound,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As thou didst sit, on woman's work intent,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Abundantly content</span><br>
<span class="i0">With the vague future, floating on thy mind!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy custom thus to spend the day</span><br>
<span class="i0">In that sweet time of youth and May!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How could I, then, at times,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In those fair days of youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The only happy days I ever knew,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My hard tasks dropping, or my careless rhymes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My station take, on father's balcony,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And listen to thy voice's melody,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And watch thy hands, as they would deftly fly</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er thy embroidery!</span><br>
<span class="i0">I gazed upon the heaven serene,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sun-lit paths, the orchards green,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The distant mountain here,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And there, the far-off sea.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, mortal tongue cannot express</span><br>
<span class="i0">What then I felt of happiness!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">What gentle thoughts, what hopes divine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What loving hearts, O Sylvia mine!</span><br>
<span class="i0">In what bright colors then portrayed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were human life and fate!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oh, when I think of such fond hopes betrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A feeling seizes me</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of bitterness and misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And tenfold is my grief renewed!</span><br>
<span class="i0">O Nature, why this treachery?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why thus, with broken promises,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy children's hearts delude?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou, ere the grass was touched with winter's frost,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By fell disease attacked and overcome,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O tender plant, didst die!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The flower of thy days thou ne'er didst see;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor did thy soft heart move</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now of thy raven locks the tender praise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now of thy eyes, so loving and so shy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor with thee, on the holidays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Did thy companions talk of love.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">So perished, too, erelong,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My own sweet hope;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So too, unto my years</span><br>
<span class="i0">Did Fate their youth deny.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, alas the day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lamented hope, companion dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How hast thou passed away!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is <i>this</i> that world? These the delights,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The love, the labors, the events,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of which we once so fondly spoke?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And must <i>all</i> mortals wear this weary yoke?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, when the truth appeared,</span><br>
<span class="i0">It better seemed to die!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Cold death, the barren tomb, didst thou prefer</span><br>
<span class="i0">To harsh reality.</span></p><br>

<h2>RECOLLECTIONS.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Ye dear stars of the Bear, I did not think</span><br>
<span class="i0">I should again be turning, as I used,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To see you over father's garden shine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And from the windows talk with you again</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this old house, where as a child I dwelt,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And where I saw the end of all my joys.</span><br>
<span class="i0">What charming images, what fables, once,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sight of you created in my thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of the lights that bear you company!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Silent upon the verdant clod I sat,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My evening thus consuming, as I gazed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the heavens, and listened to the chant</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of frogs that in the distant marshes croaked;</span><br>
<span class="i0">While o'er the hedges, ditches, fire-flies roamed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the green avenues and cypresses</span><br>
<span class="i0">In yonder grove were murmuring to the wind;</span><br>
<span class="i0">While in the house were heard, at intervals,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The voices of the servants at their work.</span><br>
<span class="i0">What thoughts immense in me the sight inspired</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of that far sea, and of the mountains blue,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That yonder I behold, and which I thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">One day to cross, mysterious worlds and joys</span><br>
<span class="i0">Mysterious in the future fancying!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of my hard fate unconscious, and how oft</span><br>
<span class="i0">This sorrowful and barren life of mine</span><br>
<span class="i0">I willingly would have for death exchanged!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nor did my heart e'er tell me, I should be</span><br>
<span class="i0">Condemned the flower of my youth to spend</span><br>
<span class="i0">In this wild native region, and amongst</span><br>
<span class="i0">A wretched, clownish crew, to whom the names</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of wisdom, learning, are but empty sounds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or arguments of laughter and of scorn;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who hate, avoid me; not from envy, no;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For they do not esteem me better than</span><br>
<span class="i0">Themselves, but fancy that I, in my heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That feeling cherish; though I strive, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No token of such feeling to display.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And here I pass my years, abandoned, lost,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of love deprived, of life; and rendered fierce,</span><br>
<span class="i0">'Mid such a crowd of evil-minded ones,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My pity and my courtesy I lose,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I become a scorner of my race,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By such a herd surrounded; meanwhile, fly</span><br>
<span class="i0">The precious hours of youth, more precious far</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than fame, or laurel, or the light of day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or breath of life: thus uselessly, without</span><br>
<span class="i0">One joy, I lose thee, in this rough abode,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose only guests are care and suffering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O thou, the only flower of barren life!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The wind now from the tower of the town</span><br>
<span class="i0">The deep sound of the bell is bringing. Oh,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What comfort was that sound to me, a child,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When in my dark and silent room I lay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Besieged by terrors, longing for the dawn!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whate'er I see or hear, recalls to mind</span><br>
<span class="i0">Some vivid image, recollection sweet;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sweet in itself, but O how bitter made</span><br>
<span class="i0">By painful sense of present suffering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By idle longing for the past, though sad,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And by the still recurring thought, ?<i>I was</i>?!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yon gallery that looks upon the west;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those frescoed walls, these painted herds, the sun</span><br>
<span class="i0">Just rising o'er the solitary plain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My idle hours with thousand pleasures filled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">While busy Fancy, at my side, still spread</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her bright illusions, wheresoe'er I went.</span><br>
<span class="i0">In these old halls, when gleamed the snow without,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And round these ample windows howled the wind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My sports resounded, and my merry words,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In those bright days, when all the mysteries</span><br>
<span class="i0">And miseries of things an aspect wear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So full of sweetness; when the ardent youth</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sees in his untried life a world of charms,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, like an unexperienced lover, dotes</span><br>
<span class="i0">On heavenly beauty, creature of his dreams!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O hopes, illusions of my early days!?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of you I still must speak, to you return;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For neither flight of time, nor change of thoughts,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or feelings, can efface you from my mind.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Full well I know that honor and renown</span><br>
<span class="i0">Are phantoms; pleasures but an idle dream;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That life, a useless misery, has not</span><br>
<span class="i0">One solid fruit to show; and though my days</span><br>
<span class="i0">Are empty, wearisome, my mortal state</span><br>
<span class="i0">Obscure and desolate, I clearly see</span><br>
<span class="i0">That Fortune robs me but of little. Yet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas! as often as I dwell on you,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ye ancient hopes, and youthful fancy's dreams,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And then look at the blank reality,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A life of ennui and of wretchedness;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And think, that of so vast a fund of hope,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Death is, to-day, the only relic left,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I feel oppressed at heart, I feel myself</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of every comfort utterly bereft.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when the death, that I have long invoked,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shall be at hand, the end be reached of all</span><br>
<span class="i0">My sufferings; when this vale of tears shall be</span><br>
<span class="i0">To me a stranger, and the future fade,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Fade from sight forever; even then, shall I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Recall you; and your images will make</span><br>
<span class="i0">Me sigh; the thought of having lived in vain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will then intrude, with bitterness to taint</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sweetness of that day of destiny.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nay, in the first tumultuous days of youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With all its joys, desires, and sufferings,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I often called on death, and long would sit</span><br>
<span class="i0">By yonder fountain, longing, in its waves</span><br>
<span class="i0">To put an end alike to hope and grief.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And afterwards, by lingering sickness brought</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the borders of the grave, I wept</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er my lost youth, the flower of my days,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So prematurely fading; often, too,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At late hours sitting on my conscious bed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Composing, by the dim light of the lamp,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I with the silence and the night would moan</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er my departing soul, and to myself</span><br>
<span class="i0">In languid tones would sing my funeral-song.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Who can remember you without a sigh,</span><br>
<span class="i0">First entrance into manhood, O ye days</span><br>
<span class="i0">Bewitching, inexpressible, when first</span><br>
<span class="i0">On the enchanted mortal smiles the maid,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all things round in emulation smile;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And envy holds its peace, not yet awake,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or else in a benignant mood; and when,</span><br>
<span class="i0">?O marvel rare!?the world a helping hand</span><br>
<span class="i0">To him extends, his faults excuses, greets</span><br>
<span class="i0">His entrance into life, with bows and smiles</span><br>
<span class="i0">Acknowledges his claims to its respect?</span><br>
<span class="i0">O fleeting days! How like the lightning's flash,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They vanish! And what mortal can escape</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unhappiness, who has already passed</span><br>
<span class="i0">That golden period, his own <i>good</i> time,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That comes, alas, so soon to disappear?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And thou, Nerina, does not every spot</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy memory recall? And couldst thou e'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">Be absent from my thought? Where art thou gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That here I find the memory alone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of thee, my sweet one? Thee thy native place</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beholds no more; that window, whence thou oft</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wouldst talk with me, which sadly now reflects</span><br>
<span class="i0">The light of yonder stars, is desolate.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where art thou, that I can no longer hear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy gentle voice, as in those days of old,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When every faintest accent from thy lips</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was wont to turn me pale? Those days have gone.</span><br>
<span class="i0">They <i>have been</i>, my sweet love! And thou with them</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast passed. To others now it is assigned</span><br>
<span class="i0">To journey to and fro upon the earth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And others dwell amid these fragrant hills.</span><br>
<span class="i0">How quickly thou hast passed! Thy life was like</span><br>
<span class="i0">A dream. While dancing there, joy on thy brow</span><br>
<span class="i0">Resplendent shone, anticipations bright</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shone in thy eyes, the light of youth, when Fate</span><br>
<span class="i0">Extinguished them, and thou didst prostrate lie.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nerina, in my heart the old love reigns.</span><br>
<span class="i0">If I at times still go unto some feast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or social gathering, unto myself</span><br>
<span class="i0">I say: ?Nerina, thou no more to feast</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dost go, nor for the ball thyself adorn.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">If May returns, when lovers offerings</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of flowers and of songs to maidens bring,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I say: ?Nerina mine, to thee spring ne'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">Returns, and love no more its tribute brings.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each pleasant day, each flowery field that I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold, each pleasure that I taste, the thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">Suggest: ?Nerina pleasure knows no more,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The face of heaven and earth no more beholds.?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, thou hast passed, for whom I ever sigh!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast passed; and still the memory of thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">Remains, and with each thought and fancy blends</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each varying emotion of the heart;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And <i>will</i> remain, so bitter, yet so sweet!</span></p><br>

<h2>NIGHT SONG OF A WANDERING SHEPHERD IN ASIA.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">What doest thou in heaven, O moon?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Say, silent moon, what doest thou?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou risest in the evening; thoughtfully</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou wanderest o'er the plain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then sinkest to thy rest again.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And art thou never satisfied</span><br>
<span class="i0">With going o'er and o'er the selfsame ways?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Art never wearied? Dost thou still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon these valleys love to gaze?</span><br>
<span class="i0">How much thy life is like</span><br>
<span class="i0">The shepherd's life, forlorn!</span><br>
<span class="i0">He rises in the early dawn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">He moves his flock along the plain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The selfsame flocks, and streams, and herbs</span><br>
<span class="i0">He sees again;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then drops to rest, the day's work o'er;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hopes for nothing more.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Tell me, O moon, what signifies his life</span><br>
<span class="i0">To him, thy life to thee? Say, whither tend</span><br>
<span class="i0">My weary, short-lived pilgrimage,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy course, that knows no end?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And old man, gray, infirm,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Half-clad, and barefoot, he,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath his burden bending wearily,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er mountain and o'er vale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sharp rocks, and briars, and burning sand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In wind, and storm, alike in sultry heat</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in the winter's cold,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His constant course doth hold;</span><br>
<span class="i0">On, on, he, panting, goes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor pause, nor rest he knows;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Through rushing torrents, over watery wastes;</span><br>
<span class="i0">He falls, gets up again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And ever more and more he hastes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Torn, bleeding, and arrives at last</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where ends the path,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where all his troubles end;</span><br>
<span class="i0">A vast abyss and horrible,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where plunging headlong, he forgets them all.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such scene of suffering, and of strife,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O moon, is this our mortal life.</span><br>
<span class="i0">In travail man is born;</span><br>
<span class="i0">His birth too oft the cause of death,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with his earliest breath</span><br>
<span class="i0">He pain and torment feels: e'en from the first,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His parents fondly strive</span><br>
<span class="i0">To comfort him in his distress;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And if he lives and grows,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They struggle hard, as best they may,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With pleasant words and deeds to cheer him up,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And seek with kindly care,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To strengthen him his cruel lot to bear.</span><br>
<span class="i0">This is the best that they can do</span><br>
<span class="i0">For the poor child, however fond and true.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But wherefore give him life?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why bring him up at all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If <i>this</i> be all?</span><br>
<span class="i0">If life is nought but pain and care,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why, why should we the burden bear?</span><br>
<span class="i0">O spotless moon, such <i>is</i></span><br>
<span class="i0">Our mortal life, indeed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But thou immortal art,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor wilt, perhaps, unto my words give heed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Yet thou, eternal, lonely wanderer,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, thoughtful, lookest on this earthly scene,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must surely understand</span><br>
<span class="i0">What all our sighs and sufferings mean;</span><br>
<span class="i0">What means this death,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This color from our cheeks that fades,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This passing from the earth, and losing sight</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of every dear, familiar scene.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Well must thou comprehend</span><br>
<span class="i0">The reason of these things; must see</span><br>
<span class="i0">The good the morning and the evening bring:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest, thou, what love it is</span><br>
<span class="i0">That brings sweet smiles unto the face of spring;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The meaning of the Summer's glow,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of the Winter's frost and snow,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of the silent, endless flight of Time.</span><br>
<span class="i0">A thousand things to thee their secrets yield,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That from the simple shepherd are concealed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oft as I gaze at thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In silence resting o'er the desert plain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which in the distance borders on the sky,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or following me, as I, by slow degrees,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My flocks before me drive;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when I gaze upon the stars at night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In thought I ask myself,</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Why all these torches bright?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What mean these depths of air,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This vast, this silent sky,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This nightly solitude? And what am I??</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thus to myself I talk; and of this grand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Magnificent expanse,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And its untold inhabitants,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all this mighty motion, and this stir</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of things above, and things below,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No rest that ever know,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But as they still revolve, must still return</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the place from which they came,?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this, alas, I find nor end nor aim!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But thou, immortal, surely knowest all.</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>This</i> I well know, and feel;</span><br>
<span class="i0">From these eternal rounds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And from my being frail,</span><br>
<span title="Original read 'Others, perhance,'" class="i0">Others, perchance, may pleasure, profit gain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To <i>me</i> life is but pain.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">My flock, now resting there, how happy thou,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That knowest not, I think, thy misery!</span><br>
<span class="i0">O how I envy thee!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not only that from suffering</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou seemingly art free;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That every trouble, every loss,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each sudden fear, thou canst so soon forget;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But more because thou sufferest</span><br>
<span class="i0">No weariness of mind.</span><br>
<span class="i0">When in the shade, upon the grass reclined,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou seemest happy and content,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And great part of the year by thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">In sweet release from care is spent.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But when <i>I</i> sit upon the grass</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in the friendly shade, upon my mind</span><br>
<span class="i0">A weight I feel, a sense of weariness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That, as I sit, doth still increase</span><br>
<span class="i0">And rob me of all rest and peace.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet I wish for nought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And have, till now, no reason to complain.</span><br>
<span class="i0">What joy, how much I cannot say;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But thou <i>some</i> pleasure dost obtain.</span><br>
<span class="i0">My joys are few enough;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But not for that do I lament.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, couldst thou speak, I would inquire:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Tell me, dear flock, the reason why</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each weary breast can rest at ease,</span><br>
<span class="i0">While all things round him seem to please;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, if <i>I</i> lie down to rest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I am by anxious thoughts oppressed?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Perhaps, if I had wings</span><br>
<span class="i0">Above the clouds to fly,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And could the stars all number, one by one,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or like the lightning leap from rock to rock,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I might be happier, my dear flock,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I might be happier, gentle moon!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Perhaps my thought still wanders from the truth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When I at others' fortunes look:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Perhaps in every state beneath the sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or high, or low, in cradle or in stall,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The day of birth is fatal to us all.</span></p><br>

<h2>CALM AFTER STORM.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">The storm hath passed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">I hear the birds rejoice; the hen,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Returned into the road again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her cheerful notes repeats. The sky serene</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is, in the west, upon the mountain seen:</span><br>
<span class="i0">The country smiles; bright runs the silver stream.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each heart is cheered; on every side revive</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sounds, the labors of the busy hive.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The workman gazes at the watery sky,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As standing at the door he sings,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His work in hand; the little wife goes forth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in her pail the gathered rain-drops brings;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The vendor of his wares, from lane to lane,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Begins his daily cry again.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sun returns, and with his smile illumes</span><br>
<span class="i0">The villas on the neighboring hills;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Through open terraces and balconies,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The genial light pervades the cheerful rooms;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, on the highway, from afar are heard</span><br>
<span class="i0">The tinkling of the bells, the creaking wheels</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of waggoner, his journey who resumes.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Cheered is each heart.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whene'er, as now, doth life appear</span><br>
<span class="i0">A thing so pleasant and so dear?</span><br>
<span class="i0">When, with such love,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Does man unto his books or work return?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or on himself new tasks impose?</span><br>
<span class="i0">When is he less regardful of his woes?</span><br>
<span class="i0">O pleasure, born of pain!</span><br>
<span class="i0">O idle joy, and vain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Fruit of the fear just passed, which shook</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wretch who life abhorred, yet dreaded death!</span><br>
<span class="i0">With which each neighbor held his breath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Silent, and cold, and wan,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Affrighted sore to see</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lightnings, clouds, and winds arrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To do us injury!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O Nature courteous!</span><br>
<span class="i0">These are thy boons to us,</span><br>
<span class="i0">These the delights to mortals given!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Escape from pain, best gift of heaven!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou scatterest sorrows with a bounteous hand;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Grief springs spontaneous;</span><br>
<span class="i0">If, by some monstrous growth, miraculous,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Pleasure at times is born of pain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">It is a precious gain!</span><br>
<span class="i0">O human race, unto the gods so dear!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too happy, in a respite brief</span><br>
<span class="i0">From any grief!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then only blessed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When Death releases thee unto thy rest!</span></p><br>

<h2>THE VILLAGE SATURDAY NIGHT.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">The damsel from the field returns,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sun is sinking in the west;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her bundle on her head she sets,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in her hand she bears</span><br>
<span class="i0">A bunch of roses and of violets.</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-morrow is a holiday,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And she, as usual, must them wear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon her bodice, in her hair.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The old crone sits among her mates,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the stairs, and spins;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, looking at the fading light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of good old-fashioned times she prates,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When she, too, dressed for holidays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with light heart, and limb as light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Would dance at night</span><br>
<span class="i0">With the companions of her merry days.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The twilight shades around us close,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sky to deepest blue is turned;</span><br>
<span class="i0">From hills and roofs the shadows fall,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the new moon her face of silver shows.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And now the cheerful bell</span><br>
<span class="i0">Proclaims the coming festival.</span><br>
<span class="i0">By its familiar voice</span><br>
<span class="i0">How every heart is cheered!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The children all in troops,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Around the little square</span><br>
<span class="i0">Go, leaping here and there,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And make a joyful sound.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile the ploughman, whistling, returns</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto his humble nest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thinks with pleasure of his day of rest.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Then, when all other lights are out,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all is silent round,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hammer's stroke we hear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">We hear the saw of carpenter,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who with closed doors his vigil keeps,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Toils o'er his lamp and strives so hard,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His work to finish ere the dawn appear.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The dearest day of all the week</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is this, of hope and joy so full;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, sad and dull,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hours will bring, for each must in his thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">His customary task-work seek.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou little, sportive boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This blooming age of thine</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is like to-day, so full of joy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And is the day, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That must the sabbath of thy life precede.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Enjoy, it, then, my darling child,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor speed the flying hours!</span><br>
<span class="i0">I say to thee no more:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, in this sad world of ours,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How far exceeds the holiday,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The day that goes before!</span></p><br>

<h2>THE RULING THOUGHT.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Most sweet, most powerful,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Controller of my inmost soul;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The terrible, yet precious gift</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of heaven, companion kind</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of all my days of misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O thought, that ever dost recur to me;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Of thy mysterious power</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who speaketh not? Who hath not felt</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its subtle influence?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet, when one is by feeling deep impelled</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its secret joys and sorrows to unfold,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The theme seems ever new however old.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How isolated is my mind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Since thou in it hast come to dwell!</span><br>
<span class="i0">As by some magic spell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My other thoughts have all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like lightning, disappeared;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou, alone, like some huge tower,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In a deserted plain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Gigantic, solitary, dost remain.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How worthless quite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Save but for thee, have in my sight</span><br>
<span class="i0">All earthly things, and life itself become!</span><br>
<span class="i0">How wearisome its days;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all its works, and all its plays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A vain pursuit of pleasures vain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Compared with the felicity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The heavenly joy, that springs from thee!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">As from the naked rocks</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the rough Apennine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The weary pilgrim turns his longing eyes</span><br>
<span class="i0">To the bright plain that in the distance lies;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So from the rough and barren intercourse</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of worldly men, to thee I gladly turn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As to a Paradise, my weary mind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sweet refreshment for my senses find.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">It seems to me incredible, that I</span><br>
<span class="i0">This dreary world, this wretched life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So full of folly and of strife,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Without thy aid, could have so long endured;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor can I well conceive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How one's desires <i>could</i> cling</span><br>
<span class="i0">To other joys than those which thou dost bring.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Never, since first I knew</span><br>
<span class="i0">By hard experience what life is,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Could fear of death my soul subdue.</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-day, a jest to me appears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That which the silly world,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Praising at times, yet ever hates and fears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The last extremity!</span><br>
<span class="i0">If danger comes, I, with undaunted mien,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its threats encounter with a smile serene.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">I always hated coward souls,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And meanness held in scorn.</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>Now</i>, each unworthy act</span><br>
<span class="i0">At once through all my senses thrills;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each instance vile of human worthlessness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My soul with holy anger fills.</span><br>
<span class="i0">This arrogant, this foolish age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which feeds itself on empty hopes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Absorbed in trifles, virtue's enemy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which idly clamors for utility,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And has not sense enough to see</span><br>
<span class="i0">How <i>useless</i> all life thenceforth must become,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I feel <i>beneath</i> me, and its judgments laugh</span><br>
<span class="i0">To scorn. The motley crew,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The foes of every lofty thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who laugh at <i>thee</i>, I trample under foot.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">To that, which thee inspires,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What passion yieldeth not?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What other, save this one,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Controls our hearts' desires?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ambition, avarice, disdain, and hate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The love of power, love of fame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What are they but an empty name,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Compared with it? And this,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The source, the spring of all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That sovereign reigns within the breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Eternal laws have on our hearts impressed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Life hath no value, meaning hath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Save but for thee, our only hope and stay;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sole excuse for Fate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That cruelly hath placed us here,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To undergo such useless misery;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For thee alone, the wise man, not the fool,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To life still fondly clings,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor calls on death to end his sufferings.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thy joys to gather, thou sweet thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Long years of sorrow I endure,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And bear of weary life the strain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But not in vain!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I would still return,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In spite of all my sad experience,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Towards such a goal, my course to recommence;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For through the sands, and through the viper-brood</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this, our mortal wilderness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My steps I ne'er so wearily have dragged</span><br>
<span class="i0">To thee, that all the danger and distress</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were not repaid by such pure happiness.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O what a world, what new immensity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What paradise is that,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To which, so oft, by thy stupendous charm</span><br>
<span class="i0">Impelled, I seem to soar! Where I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath a brighter light am wandering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And my poor earthly state,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all life's bitter truths forget!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such are, I ween, the dreams</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the Immortals. Ah, what <i>but</i> a dream,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Art thou, sweet thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The truth, that thus embellished?</span><br>
<span class="i0">A dream, an error manifest!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But of a nature, still divine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">An error brave and strong,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That will with truth the fight prolong,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And oft for truth doth compensate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor leave us e'er, till summoned hence by Fate.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And surely thou, my thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou sole sustainer of my days,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cause beloved of sorrows infinite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In Death alone wilt be extinguished quite;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For by sure signs within my soul I feel</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy sovereign sway, perpetual.</span><br>
<span class="i0">All other fancies sweet</span><br>
<span class="i0">The aspect of the truth</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hath weakened ever. But whene'er I turn</span><br>
<span class="i0">To gaze again on her, of whom with thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">To speak, is all I live for, ah,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That great delight increases still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That frenzy fine, the breath of life, to me!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Angelic beauty! Every lovely face,</span><br>
<span class="i0">On which I gaze,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A phantom seems to me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That vainly strives to copy thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of all the graces that our souls inthral,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sole fount, divine original!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Since first I thee beheld,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of what most anxious care of mine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not been the end and aim?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What day has ever passed, what hour,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When I thought not of thee? What dream of mine</span><br>
<span class="i0">Has not been haunted by thy face divine?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Angelic countenance, that we</span><br>
<span class="i0">In dreams, alas, alone may see,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What else on earth, what in the universe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Do I e'er ask, or hope for, more,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than those dear eyes forever to behold?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than thy sweet thought still in my heart to hold?</span></p><br>

<h2>LOVE AND DEATH.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Children of Fate, in the same breath</span><br>
<span class="i0">Created were they, Love and Death.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such fair creations ne'er were seen,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or here below, or in the heaven serene.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The first, the source of happiness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fount whence flows the greatest bliss</span><br>
<span class="i0">That in the sea of being e'er is found;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The last each sorrow gently lulls,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each harsh decree of Fate annuls.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Fair child with beauty crowned,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sweet to behold, not such</span><br>
<span class="i0">As cowards paint her in their fright,</span><br>
<span class="i0">She in young Love's companionship</span><br>
<span class="i0">Doth often take delight,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As they o'er mortal paths together fly,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Chief comforters of every loyal heart.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor ever is the heart more wise</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than when Love smites it, nor defies</span><br>
<span class="i0">More scornfully life's misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for no other lord</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will it all dangers face so readily.</span><br>
<span class="i0">When thou thy aid dost lend,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O Love, is courage born, or it revives;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And wise in deeds the race of man becomes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And not, as it is prone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In fruitless thought alone.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And when first in our being's depth</span><br>
<span class="i0">This passion deep is born,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though happy, we are still forlorn;</span><br>
<span class="i0">A languor strange doth o'er us steal;</span><br>
<span class="i0">A strange desire of death we feel.</span><br>
<span class="i0">I know not why, but such we ever prove</span><br>
<span class="i0">The first effect of true and potent love.</span><br>
<span class="i0">It may be, that this wilderness</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then first appals our sight;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And earth henceforth to us a dreary waste</span><br>
<span class="i0">Appears, without that new, supreme delight,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That in our thought is fondly traced;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet our hearts, foreboding, feel the storm</span><br>
<span class="i0">Within, that it may cause, the misery.</span><br>
<span class="i0">We long for rest, we long to flee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hoping some friendly haven may be found</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of refuge from the fierce desire,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That raging, roaring, darkens all around.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And when this formidable power</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hath his whole soul possessed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And raging care will give his heart no rest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How many times implored</span><br>
<span class="i0">With most intense desire,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Art thou, O Death, by the poor wretch, forlorn!</span><br>
<span class="i0">How oft at eve, how oft at dawn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His weary frame upon the couch he throws,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too happy, if he never rose,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In hopeless conflict with his pain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor e'er beheld the bitter light again!</span><br>
<span class="i0">And oft, at sound of funeral bell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And solemn chant, that guides</span><br>
<span class="i0">Departed souls unto eternal rest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With sighs most ardent from his inmost breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How hath he envied him,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who with the dead has gone to dwell!</span><br>
<span class="i0">The very humblest of his kind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The simple, rustic hind, who knows</span><br>
<span class="i0">No charm that knowledge gives;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lowliest country lass that lives,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, at the very thought of death,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Doth feel her hair in horror rise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will calmly face its agonies,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the terrors of the tomb will gaze</span><br>
<span class="i0">With fixed, undaunted look,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will o'er the steel and poison brood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In meditative mood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in her narrow mind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The kindly charm of dying comprehend:</span><br>
<span class="i0">So much the discipline of Love</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hath unto Death all hearts inclined!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Full often when this inward woe</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such pass has reached as mortal strength</span><br>
<span class="i0">No longer can endure,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The feeble body yields at length,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To its fierce blows, and timely, then,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Benignant Death her friendly power doth show:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or else Love drives her hapless victims so,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alike the simple clown,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And tender country lass,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That on themselves their desperate hands they lay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so are borne unto the shades below.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The world but laughs at their distress,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whom heaven with peace and length of days doth bless.</span><br>
<span class="i0">To fervid, happy, restless souls</span><br>
<span class="i0">May fate the one or other still concede,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sweet sovereigns, friendly to our race,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose power, throughout the universe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such miracles hath wrought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As naught resembles, nor can aught,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Save that of Fate itself, exceed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou, whom from my earliest years,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still honored I invoke,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O lovely Death! the only friend</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of sufferers in this vale of tears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If I have ever sought</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy princely state to vindicate</span><br>
<span class="i0">From the affronts of the ungrateful crowd,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Do not delay, incline thy ear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto thy weary suppliant here!</span><br>
<span class="i0">These sad eyes close forever to the light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And let me rest in peace serene,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O thou, of all the ages Queen!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Me surely wilt thou find, whate'er the hour,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When thou thy wings unfoldest to my prayer,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With front erect, the cruel power</span><br>
<span class="i0">Defying still, of Fate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor will I praise, in fulsome mood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The scourging hand, that with my blood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The blood of innocence, is stained.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor bless it, as the human race</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is wont, through custom old and base:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each empty hope, with which the world</span><br>
<span class="i0">Itself and children would beguile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I'll cast aside, each comfort false and vile;</span><br>
<span class="i0">In thee alone my hope I'll place,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou welcome minister of grace!</span><br>
<span class="i0">In that sole thought supremely blest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That day, when my unconscious head</span><br>
<span class="i0">May on thy virgin bosom rest.</span></p><br>

<h2>TO HIMSELF.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Nor wilt thou rest forever, weary heart.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The last illusion is destroyed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I eternal thought. Destroyed!</span><br>
<span class="i0">I feel all hope and all desire depart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For life and its deceitful joys.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forever rest! Enough! Thy throbbings cease!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Naught can requite thy miseries;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor is earth worthy of thy sighs.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Life is a bitter, weary load,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The world a slough. And now, repose!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Despair no more, but find in Death</span><br>
<span class="i0">The only boon Fate on our race bestows!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still, Nature, art thou doomed to fall,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The victim scorned of that blind, brutal power</span><br>
<span class="i0">That rules and ruins all.</span></p><br>

<h2>ASPASIA.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">At times thy image to my mind returns,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Aspasia. In the crowded streets it gleams</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon me, for an instant, as I pass,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In other faces; or in lonely fields,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At noon-tide bright, beneath the silent stars,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With sudden and with startling vividness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As if awakened by sweet harmony,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The splendid vision rises in my soul.</span><br>
<span class="i0">How worshipped once, ye gods, what a delight</span><br>
<span class="i0">To me, what torture, too! Nor do I e'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">The odor of the flowery fields inhale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or perfume of the gardens of the town,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I recall thee not, as on that day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When in thy sumptuous rooms, so redolent</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of all the fragrant flowers of the spring,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Arrayed in robe of violet hue, thy form</span><br>
<span class="i0">Angelic I beheld, as it reclined</span><br>
<span class="i0">On dainty cushions languidly, and by</span><br>
<span class="i0">An atmosphere voluptuous surrounded;</span><br>
<span class="i0">When thou, a skilful Syren, didst imprint</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon thy children's round and rosy lips</span><br>
<span class="i0">Resounding, fervent kisses, stretching forth</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy neck of snow, and with thy lovely hand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The little, unsuspecting innocents</span><br>
<span class="i0">Didst to thy hidden, tempting bosom press.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The earth, the heavens transfigured seemed to me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A ray divine to penetrate my soul.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then in my side, not unprotected quite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deep driven by thy hand, the shaft I bore,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lamenting sore; and not to be removed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till twice the sun his annual round had made.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">A ray divine, O lady! to my thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy beauty seemed. A like effect is oft</span><br>
<span class="i0">By beauty caused, and harmony, that seem</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mystery of Elysium to reveal.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The stricken mortal fondly worships, then,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His own ideal, creature of his mind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which of his heaven the greater part contains.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alike in looks, in manners, and in speech,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The real and ideal seem to him,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In his confused and passion-guided soul.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But not the woman, but the dream it is,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That in his fond caresses, he adores.</span><br>
<span class="i0">At last his error finding, and the sad exchange,</span><br>
<span class="i0">He is enraged, and most unjustly, oft,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The woman chides. For rarely does the mind</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of woman to that high ideal rise;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And that which her own beauty oft inspires</span><br>
<span class="i0">In generous lovers, she imagines not,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor could she comprehend. Those narrow brows,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Cannot such great conceptions hold. The man,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deceived, builds false hopes on those lustrous eyes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And feelings deep, ineffable, nay, more</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than manly, vainly seeks in her, who is</span><br>
<span class="i0">By nature so inferior to man.</span><br>
<span class="i0">For as her limbs more soft and slender are,</span><br>
<span class="i0">So is her mind less capable and strong.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Nor hast thou ever known, Aspasia,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or couldst thou comprehend the thoughts that once</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou didst inspire in me. Thou knowest not</span><br>
<span class="i0">What boundless love, what sufferings intense,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What ravings wild, what savage impulses,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou didst arouse in me; nor will the time</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'er come when thou could'st understand them. So,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Musicians, too, are often ignorant</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the effects they with the hand and voice</span><br>
<span class="i0">Produce on him that listens. Dead is <i>that</i></span><br>
<span class="i0">Aspasia, that I so loved, aye, dead</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forever, who was once sole object of</span><br>
<span class="i0">My life; save as a phantom, ever dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That comes from time to time, and disappears.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou livest still, not only beautiful,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But in thy beauty still surpassing all;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But oh, the flame thou didst enkindle once,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Long since has been extinguished; <i>thee</i>, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I never loved, but that Divinity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Once living, buried now within my heart.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her, long time, I adored; and was so pleased</span><br>
<span class="i0">With her celestial beauty, that, although</span><br>
<span class="i0">I from the first thy nature knew full well,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all thy artful and coquettish ways,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet <i>her</i> fair eyes beholding still in <i>thine</i>,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I followed thee, delighted, while she lived;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Deceived? Ah, no! But by the pleasure led,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of that sweet likeness, that allured me so,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A long and heavy servitude to bear.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Now boast; thou can'st! Say, that to thee alone</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of all thy sex, my haughty head I bowed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To thee alone, of my unconquered heart</span><br>
<span class="i0">An offering made. Say, that thou wast the first?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And surely wast the last?that in my eye</span><br>
<span class="i0">A suppliant look beheld, and me before</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thee stand, timid and trembling (how I blush,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In saying it, with anger and with shame),</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of my own self deprived, thy every wish,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy every word submissively observing,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At every proud caprice becoming pale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At every sign of favor brightening,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And changing color at each look of thine.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The charm is over, and, with it, the yoke</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lies broken, scattered on the ground; and I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Rejoice. 'Tis true my days are laden with</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ennui; yet after such long servitude,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And such infatuation, I am glad</span><br>
<span class="i0">My judgment, freedom to resume. For though</span><br>
<span class="i0">A life bereft of love's illusions sweet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is like a starless night, in winter's midst,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yet some revenge, some comfort can I find</span><br>
<span class="i0">For my hard fate, that here upon the grass,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Outstretched in indolence I lie, and gaze</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the earth and sea and sky, and smile.</span></p><br>

<h2>ON AN OLD SEPULCHRAL BAS-RELIEF.<br><small>WHERE IS SEEN A YOUNG MAIDEN,
DEAD, IN THE ACT OF DEPARTING, TAKING LEAVE OF HER FAMILY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="i0">Where goest thou? Who calls</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thee from my dear ones far away?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Most lovely maiden, say!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alone, a wanderer, dost thou leave</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy father's roof so soon?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou unto its threshold e'er return?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou make glad one day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those, who now round thee, weeping, mourn?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Fearless thine eye, and spirited thy act;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet thou, too, art sad.</span><br>
<span class="i0">If pleasant or unpleasant be the road,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If gay or gloomy be the new abode,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To which thou journeyest, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In that grave face, how difficult to read!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ah, hard to me the problem still hath seemed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not hath the world, perhaps, yet understood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If thou beloved, or hated by the gods,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If happy, or unhappy shouldst be deemed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Death calls thee; in thy morn of life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its latest breath. Unto the nest</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou leavest, thou wilt ne'er return; wilt ne'er</span><br>
<span class="i0">The faces of thy kindred more behold;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And under ground,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The place to which thou goest will be found;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for all time will be thy sojourn there.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Happy, perhaps, thou art: but he must sigh</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, thoughtful, contemplates thy destiny.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ne'er to have seen the light, e'en at the time,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I think; but, born, e'en at the time,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When regal beauty all her charms displays,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alike in form and face,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And at her feet the admiring world</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its distant homage pays;</span><br>
<span class="i0">When every hope is in its flower,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Long, long ere dreary winter flash</span><br>
<span class="i0">His baleful gleams against the joyous brow;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like vapor gathered in the summer cloud,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That melting in the evening sky is seen</span><br>
<span class="i0">To disappear, as if one ne'er had been;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And to exchange the brilliant days to come,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For the dark silence of the tomb;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The intellect, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">May call this, happiness; but still</span><br>
<span class="i0">It may the stoutest breasts with pity fill.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Thou mother, dreaded and deplored</span><br>
<span class="i0">From birth, by all the world that lives,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nature, ungracious miracle,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That bringest forth and nourishest, to kill,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If death untimely be an evil thing,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why on these innocent heads</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou that evil bring?</span><br>
<span class="i0">If good, why, why,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beyond all other misery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To him who goes, to him who must remain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast thou such parting crowned with hopeless pain?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Wretched, where'er we look,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whichever way we turn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy suffering children are!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thee it hath pleased, that youthful hope</span><br>
<span class="i0">Should ever be by life beguiled;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The current of our years with woes be filled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And death against all ills the only shield:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And this inevitable seal,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And this immutable decree,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast thou assigned to human destiny,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why, after such a painful race,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Should not the goal, at least,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Present to us a cheerful face?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Why that, which we in constant view,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must, while we live, forever bear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sole comfort in our hour of need,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thus dress in weeds of woe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And gird with shadows so,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And make the friendly port to us appear</span><br>
<span class="i0">More frightful than the tempest drear?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">If death, indeed, be a calamity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which thou intendest for us all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whom thou, against our knowledge and our will,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast forced to draw this mortal breath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then, surely, he who dies,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A lot more enviable hath</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then he who feels his loved one's death.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, if the truth it be,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As I most firmly think,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That life is the calamity,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And death the boon, alas! who ever <i>could</i>,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What yet he <i>should</i>,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Desire the dying day of those so dear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That he may linger here,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of his best self deprived,</span><br>
<span class="i0">May see across his threshold borne,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The form beloved of her,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With whom so many years he lived,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And say to her farewell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Without the hope of meeting here again;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And then alone on earth to dwell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, looking round, the hours and places all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of lost companionship recall?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ah, Nature! how, how <i>couldst</i> thou have the heart,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From the friend's arms the friend to tear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The brother from the brother part,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The father from the child,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lover from his love,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, killing one, the other keep alive?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What dire necessity</span><br>
<span class="i0">Compels such misery</span><br>
<span class="i0">That lover should the loved one e'er survive?</span><br>
<span class="i0">But Nature in her cruel dealings still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Pays little heed unto our good or ill.</span></p><br>

<h2>ON THE PORTRAIT OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, CARVED ON HER MONUMENT.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Such <i>wast</i> thou: now in earth below,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dust and a skeleton thou art.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Above thy bones and clay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Here vainly placed by loving hands,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Sole guardian of memory and woe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The image of departed beauty stands.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Mute, motionless, it seems with pensive gaze</span><br>
<span class="i0">To watch the flight of the departing days.</span><br>
<span class="i0">That gentle look, that, wheresoe'er it fell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As now it seems to fall,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Held fast the gazer with its magic spell;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That lip, from which as from some copious urn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Redundant pleasure seems to overflow;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That neck, on which love once so fondly hung;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That loving hand, whose tender pressure still</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hand it clasped, with trembling joy would thrill;</span><br>
<span class="i0">That bosom, whose transparent loveliness</span><br>
<span class="i0">The color from the gazer's cheek would steal;</span><br>
<span class="i0">All these <i>have been</i>; and now remains alone</span><br>
<span class="i0">A wretched heap of bones and clay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Concealed from sight by this benignant stone.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">To this hath Fate reduced</span><br>
<span class="i0">The form, that, when with life it beamed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To us heaven's liveliest image seemed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">O Nature's endless mystery!</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-day, of grand and lofty thoughts the source,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And feelings not to be described,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beauty rules all, and seems,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like some mysterious splendor from on high</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forth-darted to illuminate</span><br>
<span class="i0">This dreary wilderness;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of superhuman fate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of fortunate realms, and golden worlds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A token, and a hope secure</span><br>
<span class="i0">To give our mortal state;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, for some trivial cause,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Loathsome to sight, abominable, base</span><br>
<span class="i0">Becomes, what but a little time before</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wore such an angel face;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And from our minds, in the same breath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The grand conception it inspired,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Swift vanishes and leaves no trace.</span><br>
<span class="i0">What infinite desires,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What visions grand and high,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In our exalted thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With magic power creates, true harmony!</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er a delicious and mysterious sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The exulting spirit glides,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As some bold swimmer sports in Ocean's tides:</span><br>
<span class="i0">But oh, the mischief that is wrought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If but one accent out of tune</span><br>
<span class="i0">Assaults the ear! Alas, how soon</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our paradise is turned to naught!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O human nature, why is this?</span><br>
<span class="i0">If frail and vile throughout,</span><br>
<span class="i0">If shadow, dust thou art, say, why</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hast thou such fancies, aspirations high?</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet, if framed for nobler ends,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alas, why are we doomed</span><br>
<span class="i0">To see our highest motives, truest thoughts,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By such base causes kindled, and consumed?</span></p><br>

<h2>PALINODIA.<br><small>TO THE MARQUIS GINO CAPPONI.</small></h2>

<p><span class="i0">I was mistaken, my dear Gino. Long</span><br>
<span class="i0">And greatly have I erred. I fancied life</span><br>
<span class="i0">A vain and wretched thing, and this, our age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now passing, vainest, silliest of all.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Intolerable seemed, and <i>was</i>, such talk</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the happy race of mortals, if,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Indeed, man ought or could be mortal called.</span><br>
<span class="i0">'Twixt anger and surprise, the lofty creatures laughed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forth from the fragrant Eden where they dwell;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Neglected, or unfortunate, they called me;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of joy incapable, or ignorant,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To think my lot the common lot of all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Mankind, the partner in my misery.</span><br>
<span class="i0">At length, amid the odor of cigars,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The crackling sound of dainty pastry, and</span><br>
<span class="i0">The orders loud for ices and for drinks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">'Midst clinking glasses, and 'midst brandished spoons,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The daily light of the gazettes flashed full</span><br>
<span class="i0">On my dim eyes. I saw and recognized</span><br>
<span class="i0">The public joy, and the felicity</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of human destiny. The lofty state</span><br>
<span class="i0">I saw, and value of all human things;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our mortal pathway strewed with flowers; I saw</span><br>
<span class="i0">How naught displeasing here below endures.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor less I saw the studies and the works</span><br>
<span class="i0">Stupendous, wisdom, virtue, knowledge deep</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this our age. From far Morocco to</span><br>
<span class="i0">Cathay, and from the Poles unto the Nile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From Boston unto Goa, on the track</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of flying Fortune, emulously panting,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The empires, kingdoms, dukedoms of the earth</span><br>
<span class="i0">I saw, now clinging to her waving locks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now to the end of her encircling boa.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beholding this, and o'er the ample sheets</span><br>
<span class="i0">Profoundly meditating, I became</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of my sad blunder, and myself, ashamed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The age of gold the spindles of the Fates,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O Gino, are evolving. Every sheet,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In each variety of speech and type,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The splendid promise to the world proclaims,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From every quarter. Universal love,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And iron roads, and commerce manifold,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Steam, types, and cholera, remotest lands,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Most distant nations will together bind;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor need we wonder if the pine or oak</span><br>
<span class="i0">Yield milk and honey, or together dance</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the music of the waltz. So much</span><br>
<span class="i0">The force already hath increased, both of</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alembics, and retorts, and of machines,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That vie with heaven in working miracles,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And will increase, in times that are to come:</span><br>
<span class="i0">For, evermore, from better unto best,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Without a pause, as in the past, the race</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of Shem, and Ham, and Japhet will progress.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And yet, on acorns men will never feed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unless compelled by hunger; never will</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hard iron lay aside. Full oft, indeed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They gold and silver will despise, bills of</span><br>
<span class="i0">Exchange preferring. Often, too, the race</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its generous hands with brothers' blood will stain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With fields of carnage filling Europe, and</span><br>
<span class="i0">The other shore of the Atlantic sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The new world, that the old still nourishes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As often as it sends its rival bands</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of armed adventurers, in eager quest</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of pepper, cinnamon, or other spice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or sugar-cane, aught that ministers</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the universal thirst for gold.</span><br>
<span class="i0">True worth and virtue, modesty and faith,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And love of justice, in whatever land,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From public business will be still estranged,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or utterly humiliated and</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'erthrown; condemned by Nature still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To sink unto the bottom. Insolence</span><br>
<span class="i0">And fraud, with mediocrity combined,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will to the surface ever rise, and reign.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Authority and strength, howe'er diffused,</span><br>
<span class="i0">However concentrated, will be still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Abused, beneath whatever name concealed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By him who wields them; this the law by Fate</span><br>
<span class="i0">And nature written first, in adamant:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor can a Volta with his lightnings, nor</span><br>
<span class="i0">A Davy cancel it, nor England with</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her vast machinery, nor this our age</span><br>
<span class="i0">With all its floods of Leading Articles.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The good man ever will be sad, the wretch</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will keep perpetual holiday; against</span><br>
<span class="i0">All lofty souls both worlds will still be armed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Conspirators; true honor be assailed</span><br>
<span class="i0">By calumny, and hate, and envy; still</span><br>
<span class="i0">The weak will be the victim of the strong;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hungry man upon the rich will fawn,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath whatever form of government,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Alike at the Equator and the Poles;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So will it be, while man on earth abides,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And while the sun still lights him on his way.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">These signs and tokens of the ages past</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must of necessity their impress leave</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon our brightly dawning age of gold:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Because society from Nature still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Receives a thousand principles and aims,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Diverse, discordant; which to reconcile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No wit or power of man hath yet availed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Since first our race, illustrious, was born;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor <i>will</i> avail, or treaty or gazette,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In any age, however wise or strong.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But in things more important, how complete,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ne'er seen, till now, will be our happiness!</span><br>
<span class="i0">More soft, from day to day, our garments will</span><br>
<span class="i0">Become, of woollen or of silk. Their rough</span><br>
<span class="i0">Attire the husbandman and smith will cast</span><br>
<span class="i0">Aside, will swathe in cotton their rough hides,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with the skins of beavers warm their backs.</span><br>
<span class="i0">More serviceable, more attractive, too,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will be our carpets and our counterpanes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our curtains, sofas, tables, and our chairs;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our beds, and their attendant furniture,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will a new grace unto our chambers lend;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And dainty forms of kettles and of pans,</span><br>
<span class="i0">On our dark kitchens will their lustre shed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">From Paris unto Calais, and from there</span><br>
<span class="i0">To London, and from there to Liverpool,</span><br>
<span class="i0">More rapid than imagination can</span><br>
<span class="i0">Conceive, will be the journey, nay the flight;</span><br>
<span class="i0">While underneath the ample bed of Thames,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A highway will be made, immortal work,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That <i>should</i> have been completed, years ago.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Far better lighted, and perhaps as safe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">At night, as now they are, will be the lanes</span><br>
<span class="i0">And unfrequented streets of Capitals;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, the main streets of the smaller towns.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Such privileges, such a happy lot,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Kind heaven reserves unto the coming race.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How fortunate are they, whom, as I write,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Naked and whimpering, in her arms receives</span><br>
<span class="i0">The midwife! They those longed-for days may hope</span><br>
<span class="i0">To see, when, after careful studies we</span><br>
<span class="i0">Shall know, and every nursling shall imbibe</span><br>
<span class="i0">That knowledge with the milk of the dear nurse,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How many hundred-weight of salt, and how</span><br>
<span class="i0">Much flesh, how many bushels, too, of flour,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His native town in every month consumes;</span><br>
<span class="i0">How many births and deaths in every year</span><br>
<span class="i0">The parish priest inscribes: when by the aid</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of mighty steam, that, every second, prints</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its millions, hill and dale, and ocean's vast</span><br>
<span class="i0">Expanse, e'en as we see a flock of cranes</span><br>
<span class="i0">A?rial, that suddenly the day obscure, will with Gazettes be overrun;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Gazettes, of the great Universe the life</span><br>
<span class="i0">And soul, sole fount of wisdom and of wit,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To this, and unto every coming age!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">E'en as a child, who carefully constructs,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of little sticks and leaves, an edifice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In form of temple, palace, or of tower;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, soon as he beholds the work complete,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The impulse feels, the structure to destroy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Because the self-same sticks and leaves he needs,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To carry out some other enterprise;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So Nature every work of hers, however</span><br>
<span class="i0">It may delight us with its excellence,</span><br>
<span class="i0">No sooner sees unto perfection brought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than she proceeds to pull it all to pieces,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For other structures using still the parts.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And vainly seeks the human race, itself</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or others from the cruel sport to save,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cause of which is hidden from its sight</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forever, though a thousand means it tries,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With skilful hand devising remedies:</span><br>
<span class="i0">For cruel Nature, child invincible,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our efforts laughs to scorn, and still its own</span><br>
<span class="i0">Caprices carries out, without a pause,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Destroying and creating, for its sport.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hence, a various, endless family</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of ills incurable and sufferings</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oppresses the frail mortal, doomed to death</span><br>
<span class="i0">Irreparably; hence a hostile force,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Destructive, smites him from within, without,</span><br>
<span class="i0">On every side, perpetual, e'en from</span><br>
<span class="i0">The day of birth, and wearies and exhausts,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Itself untiring, till he drops at last,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By the inhuman mother crushed, and killed.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those crowning miseries, O gentle friend,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this our mortal life, old age and death,</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'en then commencing, when the infant lip</span><br>
<span class="i0">The tender breast doth press, that life instils,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This happy nineteenth century, I think,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Can no more help, than could the ninth, or tenth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor will the coming ages, more than this.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Indeed, if we may be allowed to call</span><br>
<span class="i0">The truth by its right name, no other than</span><br>
<span class="i0">Supremely wretched must each mortal be,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In every age, and under every form</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of government, and walk and mode of life;</span><br>
<span class="i0">By nature hopelessly incurable,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Because a universal law hath so</span><br>
<span class="i0">Decreed, which heaven and earth alike obey.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet the lofty spirits of our age</span><br>
<span class="i0">A new discovery have made, almost</span><br>
<span class="i0">Divine; for, though they cannot make</span><br>
<span class="i0">A single person happy on the earth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The man forgetting, they have gone in quest</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of universal happiness, and this,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forsooth, have found so easily, that out</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of many wretched individuals,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They can a happy, joyful people make.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And at this miracle, not yet explained</span><br>
<span class="i0">By quarterly reviews, or pamphlets, or</span><br>
<span class="i0">Gazettes, the common herd in wonder smile.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O minds, O wisdom, insight marvellous</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this our passing age! And what profound</span><br>
<span class="i0">Philosophy, what lessons deep, O Gino,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In matters more sublime and recondite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This century of thine and mine will teach</span><br>
<span class="i0">To those that follow! With what constancy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">What yesterday it scorned, upon its knees</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-day it worships, and will overthrow</span><br>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, merely to pick up again</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fragments, to the idol thus restored,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To offer incense on the following day!</span><br>
<span class="i0">How estimable, how inspiring, too,</span><br>
<span class="i0">This unanimity of thought, not of</span><br>
<span class="i0">The age alone, but of each passing year!</span><br>
<span class="i0">How carefully should we, when we our thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">With this compare, however different</span><br>
<span class="i0">From that of next year it may be, at least</span><br>
<span class="i0">Appearance of diversity avoid!</span><br>
<span class="i0">What giant strides, compared with those of old,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our century in wisdom's school has made!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">One of thy friends, O worthy Gino, once,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A master poet, nay, of every Art,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Science, every human faculty,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For past, and present, and for future times,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A learned expositor, remarked to me:</span><br>
<span class="i0">?Of thy own feelings, care to speak no more!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of them, this manly age makes no account,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In economic problems quite absorbed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with an eye for politics alone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of what avail, thy own heart to explore?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Seek not within thyself material</span><br>
<span class="i0">For song; but sing the needs of this our age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And consummation of its ripening hope!?</span><br>
<span class="i0">O memorable words! Whereat I laughed</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like chanticleer, the name of <i>hope</i> to hear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thus strike upon my ear profane, as if</span><br>
<span class="i0">A jest it were, or prattle of a child</span><br>
<span class="i0">Just weaned. But now a different course I take,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Convinced by many shining proofs, that he</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must not resist or contradict the age,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who seeketh praise or pudding at its hands,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But faithfully and servilely obey;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so will find a short and easy road</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the stars. And I who long to reach</span><br>
<span class="i0">The stars will not, howe'er, select the needs</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of this our age for burden of my song;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For these, increasing constantly, are still</span><br>
<span class="i0">By merchants and by work-shops amply met;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But I will sing of hope, of hope whereof</span><br>
<span class="i0">The gods now grant a pledge so palpable.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The first-fruits of our new felicity</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold, in the enormous growth of hair,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the lip, upon the cheek, of youth!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O hail, thou salutary sign, first beam</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of light of this our wondrous, rising age!</span><br>
<span class="i0">See, how before thee heaven and earth rejoice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How sparkle all the damsels' eyes with joy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">How through all banquets and all festivals</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fame of the young bearded heroes flies!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Grow for your country's sake, ye manly youth!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath the shadow of your fleecy locks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will Italy increase, and Europe from</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mouths of Tagus to the Hellespont,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the world will taste the sweets of peace.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou, O tender child, for whom these days</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of gold are yet in store, begin to greet</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy bearded father with a smile, nor fear</span><br>
<span class="i0">The harmless blackness of his loving face.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Laugh, darling child; for thee are kept the fruits</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of so much dazzling eloquence. Thou shalt</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behold joy reign in cities and in towns,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Old age and youth alike contented dwell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And undulating beards of two spans long!</span></p><br>

<h2>THE SETTING OF THE MOON.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">As, in the lonely night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Above the silvered fields and streams</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where zephyr gently blows,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And myriad objects vague,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Illusions, that deceive,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their distant shadows weave</span><br>
<span class="i0">Amid the silent rills,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The trees, the hedges, villages, and hills;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Arrived at heaven's boundary,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behind the Apennine or Alp,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or into the deep bosom of the sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The moon descends, the world grows dim;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The shadows disappear, darkness profound</span><br>
<span class="i0">Falls on each hill and vale around,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And night is desolate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And singing, with his plaintive lay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The parting gleam of friendly light</span><br>
<span class="i0">The traveller greets, whose radiance bright,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till now, hath guided him upon his way;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">So vanishes, so desolate</span><br>
<span class="i0">Youth leaves our mortal state.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The shadows disappear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the illusions dear;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in the distance fading all, are seen</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hopes on which our suffering natures lean.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Abandoned and forlorn</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our lives remain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the bewildered traveller, in vain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As he its course surveys,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To find the end, or object tries,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the long path that still before him lies.</span><br>
<span class="i0">A hopeless darkness o'er him steals;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Himself an alien on the earth he feels.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Too happy, and too gay</span><br>
<span class="i0">Would our hard lot appear</span><br>
<span class="i0">To those who placed us here, if youth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose every joy is born of pain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Through all our days were suffered to remain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Too merciful the law,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That sentences each animal to death,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Did not the road that leads to it,</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'er half-completed, unto us appear</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than death itself more sad and drear.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou blest invention of the Gods,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And worthy of their intellects divine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Old age, the last of all our ills,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When our desires still linger on,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though every ray of hope is gone;</span><br>
<span class="i0">When pleasure's fountains all are dried,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Our pains increasing, every joy denied!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Ye hills, and vales, and fields,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though in the west hath set the radiant orb</span><br>
<span class="i0">That shed its lustre on the veil of night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will not long time remain bereft,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In hopeless darkness left?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Ye soon will see the eastern sky</span><br>
<span class="i0">Grow white again, the dawn arise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Precursor of the sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who with the splendor of his rays</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will all the scene irradiate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with his floods of light</span><br>
<span class="i0">The fields of heaven and earth will inundate.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But mortal life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">When lovely youth has gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is colored with no other light,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And knows no other dawn.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The rest is hopeless wretchedness and gloom;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The journey's end, the dark and silent tomb.</span></p><br>

<h2>THE GINESTRA,<br><small>OR THE FLOWER OF THE WILDERNESS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="i0">Here, on the arid ridge</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of dead Vesuvius,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Exterminator terrible,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That by no other tree or flower is cheered,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou scatterest thy lonely leaves around,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O fragrant flower,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With desert wastes content. Thy graceful stems</span><br>
<span class="i0">I in the solitary paths have found,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The city that surround,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That once was mistress of the world;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of her fallen power,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They seemed with silent eloquence to speak</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the thoughtful wanderer.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And now again I see thee on this soil,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of wretched, world-abandoned spots the friend,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of ruined fortunes the companion, still.</span><br>
<span class="i0">These fields with barren ashes strown,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And lava, hardened into stone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Beneath the pilgrim's feet, that hollow sound,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where by their nests the serpents coiled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lie basking in the sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And where the conies timidly</span><br>
<span class="i0">To their familiar burrows run,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were cheerful villages and towns,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With waving fields of golden grain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And musical with lowing herds;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were gardens, and were palaces,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That to the leisure of the rich</span><br>
<span class="i0">A grateful shelter gave;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Were famous cities, which the mountain fierce,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forth-darting torrents from his mouth of flame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Destroyed, with their inhabitants.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now all around, one ruin lies,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where thou dost dwell, O gentle flower,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, as in pity of another's woe,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A perfume sweet thou dost exhale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To heaven an offering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And consolation to the desert bring.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Here let him come, who hath been used</span><br>
<span class="i0">To chant the praises of our mortal state,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And see the care,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That loving Nature of her children takes!</span><br>
<span class="i0">Here may he justly estimate</span><br>
<span class="i0">The power of mortals, whom</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cruel nurse, when least they fear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With motion light can in a moment crush</span><br>
<span class="i0">In part, and afterwards, when in the mood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With motion not so light, can suddenly,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And utterly annihilate.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Here, on these blighted coasts,</span><br>
<span class="i0">May he distinctly trace</span><br>
<span class="i0">?The princely progress of the human race!?</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Here look, and in a mirror see thyself,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O proud and foolish age!</span><br>
<span class="i0">That turn'st thy back upon the path,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thought revived</span><br>
<span class="i0">So clearly indicates to all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And this, thy movement retrograde,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dost <i>Progress</i> call.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy foolish prattle all the minds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose cruel fate thee for a father gave,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Besmear with flattery,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Although, among themselves, at times,</span><br>
<span class="i0">They laugh at thee.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But I will not to such low arts descend,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Though envy it would be for me,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The rest to imitate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, raving, wilfully,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To make my song more pleasing to thy ears:</span><br>
<span class="i0">But I will sooner far reveal,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As clearly as I can, the deep disdain</span><br>
<span class="i0">That I for thee within my bosom feel;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Although I know, oblivion</span><br>
<span class="i0">Awaits the man who holds his age in scorn:</span><br>
<span class="i0">But this misfortune, which I share with thee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My laughter only moves.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou dream'st of liberty,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet thou wouldst anew that thought enslave,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By which alone we are redeemed, in part,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From barbarism; by which alone</span><br>
<span class="i0">True progress is obtained,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And states are guided to a nobler end.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so the truth of our hard lot,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And of the humble place</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which Nature gave us, pleased thee not;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And like a coward, thou hast turned thy back</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the light, which made it evident;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Reviling him who does that light pursue,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And praising him alone</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, in his folly, or from motives base,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Above the stars exalts the human race.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">A man of poor estate, and weak of limb,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But of a generous, truthful soul,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor calls, nor deems himself</span><br>
<span class="i0">A Cr?sus, or a Hercules,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor makes himself ridiculous</span><br>
<span class="i0">Before the world with vain pretence</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of vigor or of opulence;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But his infirmities and needs</span><br>
<span class="i0">He lets appear, and without shame,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And speaking frankly, calls each thing</span><br>
<span class="i0">By its right name.</span><br>
<span class="i0">I deem not <i>him</i> magnanimous,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But simply, a great fool,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, born to perish, reared in suffering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Proclaims his lot a happy one,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with offensive pride</span><br>
<span class="i0">His pages fills, exalted destinies</span><br>
<span class="i0">And joys, unknown in heaven, much less</span><br>
<span class="i0">On earth, absurdly promising to those</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who by a wave of angry sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or breath of tainted air,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or shaking of the earth beneath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Are ruined, crushed so utterly,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As scarce to be recalled by memory.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But truly noble, wise is <i>he</i>,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who bids his brethren boldly look</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon our common misery;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who frankly tells the naked truth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Acknowledging our frail and wretched state,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the ills decreed to us by Fate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who shows himself in suffering brave and strong,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor adds unto his miseries</span><br>
<span class="i0">Fraternal jealousies and strifes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The hardest things to bear of all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Reproaching man with his own grief,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But the true culprit</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who, in our birth, a mother is,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A fierce step-mother in her will.</span><br>
<span class="i0"><i>Her</i> he proclaims the enemy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thinking all the human race</span><br>
<span class="i0">Against her armed, as is the case,</span><br>
<span class="i0">E'en from the first, united and arrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">All men esteems confederates,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And with true love embraces all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Prompt and efficient aid bestowing, and</span><br>
<span class="i0">Expecting it, in all the pains</span><br>
<span class="i0">And perils of the common war.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And to resent with arms all injuries,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or snares and pit-falls for a neighbor lay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Absurd he deems, as it would be, upon</span><br>
<span class="i0">The field, surrounded by the enemy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The foe forgetting, bitter war</span><br>
<span class="i0">With one's own friends to wage,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in the hottest of the fight,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With cruel and misguided sword,</span><br>
<span class="i0">One's fellow soldiers put to flight.</span><br>
<span class="i0">When truths like these are rendered clear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As once they were, unto the multitude,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when that fear, which from the first,</span><br>
<span class="i0">All mortals in a social band</span><br>
<span class="i0">Against inhuman Nature joined</span><br>
<span class="i0">Anew shall guided be, in part,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By knowledge true, then social intercourse,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And faith, and hope, and charity</span><br>
<span class="i0">Will a far different foundation have</span><br>
<span class="i0">From that which silly fables give,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By which supported, public truth and good</span><br>
<span class="i0">Must still proceed with an unstable foot,</span><br>
<span class="i0">As all things that in error have their root.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Oft, on these hills, so desolate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which by the hardened flood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That seems in waves to rise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Are clad in mourning, do I sit at night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And o'er the dreary plain behold</span><br>
<span class="i0">The stars above in purest azure shine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in the ocean mirrored from afar,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the world in brilliant sparks arrayed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Revolving through the vault serene.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And when my eyes I fasten on those lights,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which seem to them a point,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet are so immense,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That earth and sea, with them compared,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Are but a point indeed;</span><br>
<span class="i0">To whom, not only man,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But this our globe, where man is nothing, is</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unknown; and when I farther gaze upon</span><br>
<span class="i0">Those clustered stars, at distance infinite,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That seem to us like mist, to whom</span><br>
<span class="i0">Not only man and earth, but all our stars</span><br>
<span class="i0">At once, so vast in numbers and in bulk,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The golden sun himself included, are</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unknown, or else appear, as they to earth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A point of nebulous light, what, then,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dost <i>thou</i> unto my thought appear,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O race of men?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Remembering thy wretched state below,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of which the soil I tread, the token bears;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, on the other hand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thou thyself hast deemed</span><br>
<span class="i0">The Lord and end of all the Universe;</span><br>
<span class="i0">How oft thou hast been pleased</span><br>
<span class="i0">The idle tale to tell,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That to this little grain of sand, obscure,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The name of earth that bears,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The Authors of that Universe</span><br>
<span class="i0">Have, at thy call, descended oft,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And pleasant converse with thy children had;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And how, these foolish dreams reviving, e'en</span><br>
<span class="i0">This age its insults heaps upon the wise,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Although it seems all others to excel</span><br>
<span class="i0">In learning, and in arts polite;</span><br>
<span class="i0">What can I think of thee</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou wretched race of men?</span><br>
<span class="i0">What thoughts discordant then my heart assail,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In doubt, if scorn or pity should prevail!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">As a small apple, falling from a tree</span><br>
<span class="i0">In autumn, by the force</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of its own ripeness, to the ground,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The pleasant homes of a community</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of ants, in the soft clod</span><br>
<span class="i0">With careful labor built,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all their works, and all the wealth,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which the industrious citizens</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had in the summer providently stored,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Lays waste, destroys, and in an instant hides;</span><br>
<span class="i0">So, falling from on high,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To heaven forth-darted from</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mountain's groaning womb,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A dark destructive mass</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of ashes, pumice, and of stones,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With boiling streams of lava mixed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or, down the mountain's side</span><br>
<span class="i0">Descending, furious, o'er the grass,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A fearful flood</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of melted metals, mixed with burning sand,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Laid waste, destroyed, and in short time concealed</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cities on yon shore, washed by the sea,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where now the goats</span><br>
<span class="i0">On this side browse, and cities new</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the other stand, whose foot-stools are</span><br>
<span class="i0">The buried ones, whose prostrate walls</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lofty mountain tramples under foot.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nature no more esteems or cares for man,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Than for the ant; and if the race</span><br>
<span class="i0">Is not so oft destroyed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The reason we may plainly see;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Because the ants more fruitful are than we.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Full eighteen hundred years have passed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Since, by the force of fire laid waste,</span><br>
<span class="i0">These thriving cities disappeared;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And now, the husbandman,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His vineyards tending, that the arid clod,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With ashes clogged, with difficulty feeds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still raises a suspicious eye</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto that fatal crest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That, with a fierceness not to be controlled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Still stands tremendous, threatens still</span><br>
<span class="i0">Destruction to himself, his children, and</span><br>
<span class="i0">Their little property.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And oft upon the roof</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of his small cottage, the poor man</span><br>
<span class="i0">All night lies sleepless, often springing up,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The course to watch of the dread stream of fire</span><br>
<span class="i0">That from the inexhausted womb doth pour</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along the sandy ridge,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its lurid light reflected in the bay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From Mergellina unto Capri's shore.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And if he sees it drawing near,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or in his well</span><br>
<span class="i0">He hears the boiling water gurgle, wakes</span><br>
<span class="i0">His sons, in haste his wife awakes,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, with such things as they can snatch,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Escaping, sees from far</span><br>
<span class="i0">His little nest, and the small field,</span><br>
<span class="i0">His sole resource against sharp hunger's pangs,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A prey unto the burning flood,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That crackling comes, and with its hardening crust,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Inexorable, covers all.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unto the light of day returns,</span><br>
<span class="i0">After its long oblivion,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Pompeii, dead, an unearthed skeleton,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which avarice or piety</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hath from its grave unto the air restored;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And from its forum desolate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And through the formal rows</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of mutilated colonnades,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The stranger looks upon the distant, severed peaks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And on the smoking crest,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That threatens still the ruins scattered round.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And in the horror of the secret night,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Along the empty theatres,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The broken temples, shattered houses, where</span><br>
<span class="i0">The bat her young conceals,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like flitting torch, that smoking sheds</span><br>
<span class="i0">A gloom through the deserted halls</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of palaces, the baleful lava glides,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That through the shadows, distant, glares,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And tinges every object round.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thus, paying unto man no heed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or to the ages that he calls antique,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or to the generations as they pass,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nature forever young remains,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or at a pace so slow proceeds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">She stationary seems.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Empires, meanwhile, decline and fall,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And nations pass away, and languages:</span><br>
<span class="i0">She sees it not, or <i>will</i> not see;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yet man boasts of immortality!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And thou, submissive flower,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That with thy fragrant foliage dost adorn</span><br>
<span class="i0">These desolated plains,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thou, too, must fall before the cruel power</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of subterranean fire,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Which, to its well-known haunts returning, will</span><br>
<span class="i0">Its fatal border spread</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'er thy soft leaves and branches fine.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And thou wilt bow thy gentle head,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Without a struggle, yielding to thy fate:</span><br>
<span class="i0">But not with vain and abject cowardice,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Wilt thy destroyer supplicate;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor wilt, erect with senseless haughtiness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Look up unto the stars,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or o'er the wilderness,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where, not from choice, but Fortune's will,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thy birthplace thou, and home didst find;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But wiser, far, than man,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And far less weak;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For thou didst ne'er, from Fate, or power of thine,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Immortal life for thy frail children seek.</span></p><br>

<h2>IMITATION.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Wandering from the parent bough,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Little, trembling leaf,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whither goest thou?</span><br>
<span class="i0">?From the beech, where I was born,</span><br>
<span class="i0">By the north wind was I torn.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Him I follow in his flight,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Over mountain, over vale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">From the forest to the plain,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Up the hill, and down again.</span><br>
<span class="i0">With him ever on the way:</span><br>
<span class="i0">More than that, I cannot say.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Where I go, must all things go,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Gentle, simple, high and low:</span><br>
<span class="i0">Leaves of laurel, leaves of rose;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whither, heaven only knows!?</span></p><br>

<h2>SCHERZO.</h2>

<p><span class="i0">When, as a boy, I went</span><br>
<span class="i0">To study in the Muses' school,</span><br>
<span class="i0">One of them came to me, and took</span><br>
<span class="i0">Me by the hand, and all that day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">She through the work-shop led me graciously,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mysteries of the craft to see.</span><br>
<span class="i0">She guided me</span><br>
<span class="i0">Through every part,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And showed me all</span><br>
<span class="i0">The instruments of art,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And did their uses all rehearse,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In works alike of prose and verse.</span><br>
<span class="i0">I looked, and paused awhile,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then asked: ?O Muse, where is the file??</span><br>
<span class="i0">?The file is out of order, friend, and we</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now do without it,? answered she.</span><br>
<span class="i0">?But, to repair it, then, have you no care??</span><br>
<span class="i0">?We <i>should</i>, indeed, but have no time to spare.?</span></p><br>

<h2>FRAGMENTS.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="i0">I round the threshold wandering here,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Vainly the tempest and the rain invoke,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That they may keep my lady prisoner.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And yet the wind was howling in the woods,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The roving thunder bellowing in the clouds,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Before the dawn had risen in the sky.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">O ye dear clouds! O heaven! O earth! O trees!</span><br>
<span class="i0">My lady goes! Have mercy, if on earth</span><br>
<span class="i0">Unhappy lovers ever mercy find!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Awake, ye whirlwinds! storm-charged clouds, awake,</span><br>
<span class="i0">O'erwhelm me with your floods, until the sun</span><br>
<span class="i0">To other lands brings back the light of day!</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Heaven opens; the wind falls; the grass, the leaves</span><br>
<span class="i0">Are motionless, around; the dazzling sun</span><br>
<span class="i0">In my tear-laden eyes remorseless shines.</span></p><br>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="i0">The light of day was fading in the west,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The smoke no more from village chimneys curled,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Nor voice of man, nor bark of dog was heard;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">When she, obedient to Love's rendezvous,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had reached the middle of a plain, than which</span><br>
<span class="i0">No other more bewitching could be found.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The moon on every side her lustre shed,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all in robes of silver light arrayed</span><br>
<span class="i0">The trees with which the place was garlanded.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The rustling boughs were murmuring to the wind,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, blending with the plaintive nightingale,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A rivulet poured forth its sweet lament.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The sea shone in the distance, and the fields</span><br>
<span class="i0">And groves; and slowly rising, one by one,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The summits of the mountains were revealed.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">In quiet shade the sombre valley lay,</span><br>
<span class="i0">While all the little hills around were clothed</span><br>
<span class="i0">With the soft lustre of the dewy moon.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The maiden kept the silent, lonely path,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And gently passing o'er her face, she felt</span><br>
<span class="i0">The motion of the perfume-laden breeze.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">If she were happy, it were vain to ask;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The scene delighted her, and the delight</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her heart was promising, was greater still.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">How swift your flight, O lovely hours serene!</span><br>
<span class="i0">No other pleasure here below endures,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or lingers with us long, save hope alone.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The night began to change, and dark became</span><br>
<span class="i0">The face of heaven, that was so beautiful,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all her pleasure now was turned to fear.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">An angry cloud, precursor of the storm,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Behind the mountains rose, and still increased,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till moon or star no longer could be seen.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">She saw it spreading upon every side,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And by degrees ascending through the air,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And now with its black mantle covering all.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The scanty light more faint and faint became;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The wind, meanwhile, was rising in the grove,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That on the farther side the spot enclosed;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And, every moment, was more boisterous;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Till every bird, awaking in its fright,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Amidst the trembling leaves was fluttering.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The cloud, increasing still, unto the coast</span><br>
<span class="i0">Descended, so that one extremity</span><br>
<span class="i0">The mountains touched, the other touched the sea.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And now from out its black and hollow womb,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The pattering rain-drops, falling fast, were heard,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The sound increasing as the cloud drew near.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And round her now the glancing lightning flashed</span><br>
<span class="i0">In fearful mood, and made her shut her eyes;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The ground was black, the air a mass of flame.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Her trembling knees could scarce her weight sustain;</span><br>
<span class="i0">The thunder roared with a continuous sound,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like torrent, plunging headlong from the cliff.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">At times she paused, the dismal scene to view,</span><br>
<span class="i0">In blank dismay; then on she ran again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Her hair and clothes all streaming in the wind.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The cruel wind beat hard against her breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And rushing fiercely, with its angry breath,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The cold drops dashed, remorseless, in her face.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">The thunder, like a beast, assaulted her,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With terrible, unintermitting roar;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And more and more the rain and tempest raged.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And from all sides in wild confusion flew</span><br>
<span class="i0">The dust and leaves, the branches and the stones,</span><br>
<span class="i0">With hideous tumult, inconceivable.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">Her weary, blinded eyes now covering,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And folding close her clothes against her breast,</span><br>
<span class="i0">She through the storm her fearful path pursued.</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">But now the lightning glared so in her face,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That, overcome by fright at last, she went</span><br>
<span class="i0">No farther, and her heart within her sank;</span></p><br>

<p><span class="i0">And back she turned. And, even as she turned,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The lightning ceased to flash, the air was dark,</span><br>
<span class="i0">The thunder's voice was hushed, the wind stood still,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all was silent round, and she,?at rest!</span></p><br>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
