<h2>
 A DOLL'S HOUSE
</h2>
<h3>
 ACT I
</h3>
<p>
(SCENE.?<i>A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the
doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and
beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, armchairs and a
small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door;
and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs
and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table.
Engravings on the wall; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a
small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a
fire burns in the stove. It is winter.</i>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
open. Enter</i> NORA, <i>humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in
out-door dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the
table to the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and
through it is seen a</i> PORTER <i>who is carrying a Christmas Tree and
a basket, which he gives to the</i> MAID <i>who has opened the
door</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the
children do not see it

<span class="pagenum">[pg 6]</span>

till this evening, when it is dressed. (<i>To the</i> PORTER, <i>taking
out her purse</i>.) How much?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Porter</i>. Sixpence.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. (<i>The</i>
PORTER <i>thanks her, and goes out</i>. NORA <i>shuts the door. She is
laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a
packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes
cautiously to her husband's door and listens</i>.) Yes, he is in.
(<i>Still humming, she goes to the table on the right</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>calls out from his room</i>). Is that my little lark
twittering out there?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>busy opening some of the parcels</i>). Yes, it is!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. When did my squirrel come home?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Just now. (<i>Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and
wipes her mouth</i>.) Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Don't disturb me. (<i>A little later, he opens the door
and looks into the room, pen in hand</i>.) Bought, did you say? All
these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go
a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to
economize.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit

<span class="pagenum">[pg 7]</span>

more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have
a big salary and earn lots and lots of money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole
quarter before the salary is due.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Pooh! we can borrow till then.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora! (<i>Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the
ear</i>.) The same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed
fifty pounds today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then
on New Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>putting her hands over his mouth</i>). Oh! don't say
such horrid things.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Still, suppose that happened,?what then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. If that were to happen, I don't suppose I should care
whether I owed money or not.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who
they were.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what
I think about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or
beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have
kept bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way
for the short time longer that there need be any struggle.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>moving towards the stove</i>). As you please, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>following her</i>). Come, come, my

<span class="pagenum">[pg 8]</span>

little skylark must not droop her wings. What is this! Is my little
squirrel out of temper? (<i>Taking out his purse</i>.) Nora, what do you
think I have got here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>turning round quickly</i>). Money!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. There you are. (<i>Gives her some money</i>.) Do you
think I don't know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at
Christmas-time?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>counting</i>). Ten shillings?a pound?two pounds! Thank
you, thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Indeed it must.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I
have bought. And ah so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a
sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's
bedstead for Emmy.?they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break
them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the
maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And what is in this parcel?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>crying out</i>). No, no! you mustn't see that till this
evening.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little
person, what would you like for yourself?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't want anything.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you
would particularly like to have.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 9]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, I really can't think of anything?unless, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her
eyes to his</i>). If you really want to give me something, you
might?you might?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well, out with it!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>speaking quickly</i>). You might give me money, Torvald.
Only just as much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will
buy something with it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But, Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap
it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree.
Wouldn't that be fun?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What are little people called that are always wasting
money?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Spendthrifts?I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald,
and then I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a
very sensible plan, isn't it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Indeed it is?that is to say, if you
were really to save out of the money I give you, and then really buy
something for yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and
any number of unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh but, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You can't deny it, my dear, little Nora. (<i>Puts his arm
round her waist</i>.) It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a
deal of money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little
persons are!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 10]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It's a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>laughing</i>). That's very true,?all you can. But you
can't save anything!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>smiling quietly and happily</i>). You haven't any idea
how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You
always find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as
you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it
has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for
indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you
are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you
are looking rather?what shall I say?rather uneasy today?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Do I?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You do, really. Look straight at me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looks at him</i>). Well?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>wagging his finger at her</i>). Hasn't Miss
Sweet-Tooth been breaking rules in town today?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No; what makes you think that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, I assure you, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Not been nibbling sweets?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, certainly not.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 11]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, Torvald, I assure you really?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. There, there, of course I was only joking.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going to the table on the right</i>). I should not think
of going against your wishes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your
word?(<i>Going up to her</i>.) Keep your little Christmas secrets to
yourself, my darling. They will all be revealed tonight when the
Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will
come to dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this
morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am
looking forward to this evening.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves,
Torvald!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe
appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't
it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It's wonderful!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks
beforehand you shut yourself up every evening till long after midnight,
making ornaments for the Christmas Tree and all the other fine things
that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever
spent!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I didn't find it dull.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 12]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>smiling</i>). But there was precious little result,
Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I
help the cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the
best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it
is a good thing that our hard times are over.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, it is really wonderful.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and
you needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>clapping her hands</i>). No, Torvald, I needn't any
longer, need I! It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! (<i>Taking
his arm</i>.) Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to
arrange things, Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over?(<i>A bell rings
in the hall</i>.) There's the bell. (<i>She tidies the room a little</i>.)
There's someone at the door. What a nuisance!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>in the doorway</i>). A lady to see you, ma'am,?a
stranger.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Ask her to come in.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>to</i> HELMER). The doctor came at the same time, sir.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Did he go straight into my room?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Yes, sir.
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(HELMER <i>goes into his room. The</i> MAID <i>ushers in</i> MRS. LINDE,
<i>who is in traveling dress, and shuts the door</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 13]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs Linde</i> (<i>in a dejected and timid voice</i>). How do you do,
Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). How do you do?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You don't recognize me, I suppose.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> No, I don't know?yes, to be sure, I seem
to?(<i>Suddenly</i>.) Yes! Christine! Is it really you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, it is I.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Christine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how
could I?(<i>In a gentle voice</i>.) How you have altered, Christine!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight
years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have
come into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter?that was
plucky of you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I arrived by steamer this morning.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How
delightful! We will have such fun together! But take off your things.
You are not cold, I hope. (<i>Helps her</i>.) Now we will sit down by
the stove, and be cosy. No, take this arm-chair; I will sit here in the
rocking-chair. (<i>Takes her hands</i>.) Now you look like your old self
again; it was only the first moment?You are a little paler, Christine,
and perhaps a little thinner.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And much, much older, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 14]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not
much. (<i>Stops suddenly and speaks seriously</i>.) What a thoughtless
creature I am, chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do
forgive me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. What do you mean, Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>gently</i>). Poor Christine, you are a widow.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes; it is three years ago now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you,
Christine, I meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I
always put it off and something always prevented me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I quite understand, dear.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must
have suffered. And he left you nothing?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And no children?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Nothing at all, then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looking incredulously at her</i>). But, Christine, is
that possible?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>smiles sadly and strokes her hair</i>). It
sometimes happens, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I
have three lovely children. You can't see them just now, for they are
out with their nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, no; I want to hear about you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, you must begin. I mustn't be

<span class="pagenum">[pg 15]</span>

selfish today; today I must only think of your affairs. But there is one
thing I must tell you. Do you know we have just had a great piece of
good luck?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, what is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Your husband? What good luck!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes tremendous! A barrister's profession is such an
uncertain thing, especially if he won't undertake unsavoury cases; and
naturally Torvald has never been willing to do that, and I quite agree
with him. You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work
in the Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots
of commissions. For the future we can live quite differently?we can do
just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be
splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won't
it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have
what one needs.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Nora, Nora, haven't you learnt sense
yet? In our schooldays you were a great spendthrift.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Yes, that is what Torvald says now.
(<i>Wags her finger at her</i>.) But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you
think. We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have
both had to work.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You too?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes; odds and ends, needlework,

<span class="pagenum">[pg 16]</span>

crochet-work, embroidery, and that kind of thing. (<i>Dropping her
voice</i>.) And other things as well. You know Torvald left his office
when we were married? There was no prospect of promotion there, and he
had to try and earn more than before. But during the first year he
overworked himself dreadfully. You see, he had to make money every way
he could, and he worked early and late; but he couldn't stand it, and
fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go
south.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You spent a whole year in Italy, didn't you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It
was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a
wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost
a tremendous lot of money, Christine.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. So I should think.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That's a lot,
isn't it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have
the money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died,
wasn't it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I
was expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick
Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father?I never saw him again,
Christine. That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 17]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I know how fond you were of him. And then you went
off to Italy?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on
our going, so we started a month later.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And your husband came back quite well?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. As sound as a bell!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs Linde</i>. But?the doctor?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What doctor?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs Linde</i>. I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived
here just as I did, was the doctor?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn't come here
professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once
every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since then, and our
children are strong and healthy and so am I. (<i>Jumps up and claps her
hands</i>.) Christine! Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!?But
how horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. (<i>Sits
on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees</i>.) You mustn't
be angry with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your
husband? Why did you marry him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and
helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not
think I was justified in refusing his offer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time,
then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was
a precarious one; and,

<span class="pagenum">[pg 18]</span>

when he died, it all went to pieces and there was nothing left.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And then??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could
find?first a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three
years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at
an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the
boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for
themselves.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What a relief you must feel it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No
one to live for any more. (<i>Gets up restlessly</i>.) That is why I
could not stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it
may be easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my
thoughts. If only I could have the good luck to get some regular
work?office work of some kind?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look
tired out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>walking to the window</i>). I have no father to
give me money for a journey, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>rising</i>). Oh, don't be angry with me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>going up to her</i>). It is you that must not be
angry with me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes
one so bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the
look-out for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When
you told me of the happy turn your fortunes

<span class="pagenum">[pg 19]</span>

have taken?you will hardly believe it?I was delighted not so much on
your account as on my own.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How do you mean??Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps
Torvald could get you something to do.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the
subject very cleverly?I will think of something that will please him
very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me!
It is doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and
troubles of life.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I?? I know so little of them?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs Linde</i> (<i>smiling</i>). My dear! Small household cares and
that sort of thing!?You are a child, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>tosses her head and crosses the stage</i>). You ought
not to be so superior.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You are just like all the others. They all think that I am
incapable of anything really serious?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Come, come?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>.?that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your
troubles.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Pooh!?those were trifles. (<i>Lowering her voice</i>.) I
have not told you the important thing.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 20]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. The important thing? What do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You look down upon me altogether, Christine?but you ought
not to. You are proud, aren't you, of having-worked so hard and so long
for your mother?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Indeed, I don't look down on any one. But it is true
that I am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the
end of my mother's life almost free from care.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And you are proud to think of what you have done for your
brothers.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I think I have the right to be.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have
something to be proud and glad of.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any
account?no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But what is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Come here. (<i>Pulls her down on the sofa beside her</i>.)
Now I will show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of.
It was I who saved Torvald's life.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. "Saved"? How?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never
have recovered if he had not gone there?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes, that is what Torvald and all the
others think, but?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 21]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But.?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It was I who procured the
money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You? All that large sum?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win
a prize in the Lottery?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>contemptuously</i>). In the Lottery? There would have
been no credit in that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But where did you get it from, then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>humming and smiling with an air of mystery</i>). Hm, hu!
Aha!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Because you couldn't have borrowed it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Couldn't I? Why not?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband's
consent.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>tossing her head</i>). Oh, if it is a wife who has any
head for business?a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I don't understand it at all, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed
the money. I may have got it some other way. (<i>Lies back on the
sofa.</i>) Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as
attractive as I am?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You are a mad creature.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Now, you know you're full of curiosity, Christine.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't you been a little
bit imprudent?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 22]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>sits up straight</i>). Is it imprudent to save your
husband's life?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My
goodness, can't you understand that? It was necessary he should have no
idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors
came and said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to
save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn't try, first of
all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much
I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and
entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition
I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even
hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,
Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my
husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices?as I believe he
called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved?and that was how
I came to devise a way out of the difficulty?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And did your husband never get to know from your
father that the money had not come from him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let
him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill
then?alas, there never was any need to tell him.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 23]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And since then have you never told your secret to
your husband?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has
such strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and
humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to
know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations
altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Do you mean never to tell him about it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>meditatively, and with a half smile.</i>) Yes?some day,
perhaps, after many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am
now. Don't laugh at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as
devoted to me as he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting
have palled on him; then it may be a good thing to have something in
reserve?(<i>Breaking off,</i>) What nonsense! That time will never
come. Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do you still
think I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has caused
me a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my
engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is
called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called
payment in instalments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to
manage them. I have had to save a little here and there, where I could,
you understand. I have not been able to put aside much from my
housekeeping money, for

<span class="pagenum">[pg 24]</span>

Torvald must have a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily
dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the
sweet little darlings!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries
of life, poor Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it.
Whenever Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I
have never spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest
and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so
Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me,
Christine?because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn't it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Quite so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last
winter I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked
myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many
a time I was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous
pleasure to sit there working and earning money. It was like being a
man.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. How much have you been able to pay off in that way?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to
keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I
have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at
my wits' end. (<i>Smiles.</i>) Then I used to sit here and imagine that
a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 25]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. What! Who was it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Be quiet!?that he had died; and that when his will was
opened it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: "The
lovely Mrs. Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at
once in cash."
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But, my dear Nora?who could the man be?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Good gracious, can't you understand? There was no old
gentleman at all; it was only something that I used to sit here and
imagine, when I couldn't think of any way of procuring money. But it's
all the same now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far
as I am concerned; I don't care about him or his will either, for I am
free from care now. (<i>Jumps up</i>.) My goodness, it's delightful to
think of, Christine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care,
quite free from care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to
be able to keep the house beautifully and have everything just as
Torvald likes it! And, think of it, soon the spring will come and the
big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be able to take a little trip?perhaps I
shall see the sea again! Oh, it's a wonderful thing to be alive and be
happy. (<i>A bell is heard in the hall</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>rising</i>). There is the bell; perhaps I had
better go.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, don't go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be
for Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Servant</i> (<i>at the hall door</i>). Excuse me, ma'am?there is a
gentleman to see the master, and as the doctor is with him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Who is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 26]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>at the door</i>). It is I, Mrs. Helmer.
(<i>Mrs.</i> LINDE <i>starts, trembles, and turns to the window</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained low
voice</i>). You? What is it? What do you want to see my husband about?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Bank business?in a way. I have a small post in the
Bank, and I hear your husband is to be our chief now?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Then it is?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs. Helmers;
absolutely nothing else.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Be so good as to go into the study then. (<i>She bows
indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back
and makes up the fire in the stove</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nora?who was that man?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Then it really was he.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Do you know the man?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I used to?many years ago. At one time he was a
solicitor's clerk in our town.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, he was.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. He is greatly altered.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. He made a very unhappy marriage.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. He is a widower now, isn't he?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. With several children. There now, it is burning up.
(<i>Shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. They say he carries on various kinds of business.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it.
But don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 27]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Doctor Rank</i> (<i>comes out of</i> HELMER'S <i>study. Before he
shuts the door he calls to him</i>). No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb
you; I would rather go in to your wife for a little while. (<i>Shuts the
door and sees</i> Mrs. LINDE.) I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am
disturbing you too.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, not at all. (<i>Introducing him</i>.) Doctor Rank, Mrs.
Linde.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I have often heard Mrs. Linde's name mentioned here. I
think I passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs. Linde?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, I go up very slowly; I can't manage stairs well.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Ah! some slight internal weakness?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to
town to amuse yourself with our entertainments?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I have come to look for work.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Is that a good cure for overwork?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. One must live, Doctor Rank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Look here, Doctor Rank?you know you want to live.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong
the agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are
those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case, too, is at
this very moment with Helmer?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>sadly</i>). Ah!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Whom do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 28]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don't know
at all. He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs. Helmer; but
even he began talking of its being highly important that he should live.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Did he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I have no idea; I only heard that it was something about
the Bank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I didn't know this?what's his name?Krogstad had anything
to do with the Bank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. (<i>To</i> Mrs.
LINDE.) I don't know whether you find also in your part of the world
that there are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell
out moral corruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the
person concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their
eye on him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Still I think the sick are those who most need taking
care of.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>). Yes, there you are. That
is the sentiment that is turning Society into a sick-house.
</p><br>
<p>
(NORA, <i>who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into
smothered laughter and claps her hands</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Why do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society
really is?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at
something quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor
Rank, are all the people who are

<span class="pagenum">[pg 29]</span>

employed in the Bank dependent on Torvald now?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Is that what you find so extremely amusing?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>smiling and humming</i>). That's my affair! (<i>Walking
about the room</i>.) It's perfectly glorious to think that we have?that
Torvald has so much power over so many people. (<i>Takes the packet from
her pocket</i>.) Doctor Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. What! I??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald
had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my
teeth. But, bah!?once in a way?That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By
your leave! (<i>Puts a macaroon into his mouth.)</i> You must have one
too, Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one?or at most two.
(<i>Walking about</i>.) I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing
in the world now that I should dearly love to do.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Well, what is that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It's something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald
could hear me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Well, why can't you say it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>, No, I daren't; it's so shocking.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Shocking?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you
might. What is it you

<span class="pagenum">[pg 30]</span>

would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I should just love to say?Well, I'm damned!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Are you mad?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nora, dear?!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Say it, here he is!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>hiding the packet</i>). Hush! Hush! Hush! (HELMER
<i>comes out of his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his
hand</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, he has just gone.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Let me introduce you?this is Christine, who has come to
town.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Christine?? Excuse me, but I don't know?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Mrs. Linde, dear; Christine Linde.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Of course. A school friend of my wife's, I presume?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, we have known each other since then.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to
see you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, really, I?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she
is frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect
herself?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Very sensible, Mrs. Linde.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the
Bank?the news was telegraphed, you know?she traveled here as quick as
she could, Torvald, I am sure you will

<span class="pagenum">[pg 31]</span>

be able to do something for Christine, for my sake, won't you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are
a widow, Mrs. Linde?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And have had some experience of bookkeeping?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, a fair amount.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Ah! well it's very likely I may be able to find something
for you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>clapping her hands</i>). What did I tell you? What did I
tell you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs. Linde.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. How am I to thank you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. There is no need. (<i>Puts on his coat</i>.) But today
you must excuse me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Wait a minute; I will come with you. (<i>Brings his fur
coat from the hall and warms it at the fire</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Don't be long away, Torvald dear.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. About an hour, not more.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Are you going too, Christine?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>putting on her cloak</i>). Yes, I must go and look
for a room.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Oh, well then, we can walk down the street together.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>helping her</i>). What a pity it is we are so short of
space here; I am afraid it is impossible for us?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Please don't think of it! Good-bye, Nora dear, and
many thanks.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Good-bye for the present. Of course you will come back this
evening. And you too,

<span class="pagenum">[pg 32]</span>

Dr. Rank. What do you say? If you are well enough? Oh, you must be! Wrap
yourself up well. (<i>They go to the door all talking together.
Children's voices are heard on the staircase.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. There they are. There they are! (<i>She runs to open the
door. The</i> NURSE <i>comes in with the children.</i>) Come in! Come
in! (<i>Stoops and kisses them.</i>) Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at
them, Christine! Aren't they darlings?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Don't let us stand here in the draught.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Come along, Mrs. Linde; the place will only be bearable
for a mother now!
</p><br>
<p>
(RANK, HELMER, <i>and</i> MRS. LINDE <i>go downstairs. The</i> NURSE
<i>comes forward with the children;</i> NORA <i>shuts the hall
door.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks!?like apples
and roses. (<i>The children all talk at once while she speaks to
them.</i>) Have you had great fun? That's splendid! What, you pulled
both Emmy and Bob along on the sledge??both at once??that <i>was</i>
good. You are a clever boy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My
sweet little baby doll! (<i>Takes the baby from the</i> MAID <i>and
dances it up and down.</i>) Yes, yes, mother will dance with Bob too.
What! Have you been snow-balling? I wish I had been there too! No, no, I
will take their things off, Anne; please let me do it, it is such fun.
Go in now, you look half frozen. There is some hot coffee for you on the
stove.
</p><br>
<p>
(<i>The</i> NURSE <i>goes into the room on the left.

<span class="pagenum">[pg 33]</span>

Nora takes off the children's things and throws them about, while
they all talk to her at once</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Really! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn't bite
you? No, dogs don't bite nice little dolly children. You mustn't look at
the parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know.
No, no?it's something nasty! Come, let us have a game. What shall we
play at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide
first. Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. (<i>She and the children
laugh and shout, and romp in and out of the room; at last Nora hides
under the table the children rush in and look for her, but do not see
her; they hear her smothered laughter run to the table, lift up the
cloth and find her. Shouts of laughter. She crawls forward and pretends
to frighten them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile there has been a knock at
the hall door, but none of them has noticed it. The door is half opened,
and KROGSTAD appears. He waits a little; the game goes on.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>with a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her
knees</i>). Ah! what do you want?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Excuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone
forgot to shut it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>rising</i>). My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I know that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you want here, then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. A word with you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. With me??(<i>To the children, gently</i>.)

<span class="pagenum">[pg 34]</span>

Go in to nurse. What? No, the strange man won't do mother any harm. When
he has gone we will have another game. (<i>She takes the children into
the room on the left, and shuts the door after them.</i>) You want to
speak to me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Yes, I do.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Today? It is not the first of the month yet.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself
what sort of a Christmas you will spend.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you want? Today it is absolutely impossible for me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. We won't talk about that till later on. This is
something different. I presume you can give me a moment?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes?yes, I can?although?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant and saw your husband
going down the street?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. With a lady.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. May I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs. Linde?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It was.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Just arrived in town?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, today.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. She is a great friend of yours, isn't she?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>: She is. But I don't see?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I knew her too, once upon a time.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I am aware of that.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 35]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much.
Then I can ask you, without beating about the bush?is Mrs. Linde to
have an appointment in the Bank?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad??You, one
of my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes,
Mrs. Linde <i>is</i> to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded
her cause, Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I was right in what I thought, then.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>walking up and down the stage</i>). Sometimes one has a
tiny little bit of influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it
does not necessarily follow that?. When anyone is in a subordinate
position, Mr. Krogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending
anyone who?who?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Who has influence?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Exactly.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>changing his tone</i>). Mrs. Helmer, you will be so
good as to use your influence on my behalf.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What? What do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep
my subordinate position in the Bank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post
away from you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of
ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious
to expose herself to the chance of rubbing

<span class="pagenum">[pg 36]</span>

shoulders with me; and I quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for
being turned off.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But I assure you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has
come when I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But, Mr. Krogstad, I <i>have</i> no influence.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Haven't you? I thought you said yourself just now?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on
it. I! What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with
my husband?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I
don't suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. If you speak slightly of my husband, I shall turn you out
of the house.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. You are bold, Mrs. Helmer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I am not afraid of you any longer, As soon as the New Year
comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>controlling himself</i>). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer.
If necessary, I am prepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if
I were fighting for my life.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. So it seems.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that
weighs least with me in the matter. There is another reason?well, I may
as well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like
everybody else, that

<span class="pagenum">[pg 37]</span>

once, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I think I have heard something of the kind.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. The matter never came into court; but every way seemed
to be closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know
of. I had to do something; and, honestly, don't think I've been one of
the worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are
growing up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I
can in the town. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for
me?and now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the
mud.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my
power to help you at all.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Then it is because you haven't the will; but I have
means to compel you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You don't mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you
money?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Hm!?suppose I were to tell him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It would be perfectly infamous of you. (<i>Sobbing</i>.) To
think of his learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in
such an ugly, clumsy way?that he should learn it from you! And it would
put me in a horribly disagreeable position?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Only disagreeable?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>impetuously</i>). Well, do it, then!?and it will be the
worse for you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you
are, and you certainly won't keep your post then.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 38]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home
that you were afraid of?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at
once pay you what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do
with you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>coming a step nearer</i>). Listen to me, Mrs.
Helmer. Either you have a very bad memory or you know very little of
business. I shall be obliged to remind you of a few details.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two
hundred and fifty pounds.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I didn't know any one else to go to.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I promised to get you that amount?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, and you did so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I promised to get you that amount, on certain
conditions. Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and
you were so anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to
have paid no attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it
will not be amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the
money on the security of a bond which I drew up.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, and which I signed.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Good. But below your signature there were a few lines
constituting your father a surety for the money; those lines your father
should have signed.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 39]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Should? He did sign them.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I had left the date blank; that is to say your father
should himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do
you remember that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I think I remember?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Then I gave you the bond to send by post to your
father. Is that not so?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. And you naturally did so at once, because five or six
days afterwards you brought me the bond with your father's signature.
And then I gave you the money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Well, haven't I been paying it off regularly?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Fairly so, yes. But?to come back to the matter in
hand?that must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs. Helmer?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It was, indeed.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Your father was very ill, wasn't he?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. He was very near his end.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. And died soon afterwards?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Tell me, Mrs. Helmer, can you by any chance remember
what day your father died??on what day of the month, I mean.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Papa died on the 29th of September.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And,
as that is so, there is a discrepancy (<i>taking a paper from his
pocket</i>) which I cannot account for.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What discrepancy? I don't know?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. The discrepancy consists, Mrs.

<span class="pagenum">[pg 40]</span>

Helmer, in the fact that your father signed this bond three days after
his death.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you mean? I don't understand?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Your father died on the 29th of September. But, look
here; your father dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a
discrepancy, isn't it? (NORA <i>is silent</i>.) Can you explain it to
me? (NORA <i>is still silent</i>.) It is a remarkable thing, too, that
the words "2nd of October," as well as the year, are not written in your
father's handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it
can be explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature,
and someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his
death. There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the
name; and <i>that</i> is genuine, I suppose, Mrs. Helmer? It was your
father himself who signed his name here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>after a short pause, throws her head up and looks
defiantly at him</i>). No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Are you aware that is a dangerous confession?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. In what way? You shall have your money soon.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the
paper to your father?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for
his signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be
used for; and when he was so ill himself

<span class="pagenum">[pg 41]</span>

I couldn't tell him that my husband's life was in danger?it was
impossible.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. It would have been better for you if you had given up
your trip abroad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband's
life; I couldn't give that up.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. But did it never occur to you that you were committing
a fraud on me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I couldn't take that into account; I didn't trouble myself
about you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you put so many heartless
difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my
husband was in.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what
it is that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one
false step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing
worse than what you have done.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to
run a risk to save your wife's life.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. The law cares nothing about motives.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Then it must be a very foolish law.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be
judged, if I produce this paper in court.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to
spare her dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to
save her husband's life? I don't know much about

<span class="pagenum">[pg 42]</span>

law; but I am certain that there must be laws permitting such things as
that. Have you no knowledge of such laws?you who are a lawyer? You must
be a very poor lawyer, Mr. Krogstad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Maybe. But matters of business?such business as you
and I have had together?do you think I don't understand that? Very
well. Do as you please. But let me tell you this?if I lose my position
a second time, you shall lose yours with me. (<i>He bows, and goes out
through the hall</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses
her head)</i>. Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!?I am not so
silly as he thinks. (<i>Begins to busy herself putting the children's
things in order</i>.) And yet?? No, it's impossible! I did it for
love's sake.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>The Children</i> (<i>in the doorway on the left.)</i> Mother, the
stranger man has gone out through the gate.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell anyone about the
stranger man. Do you hear? Not even papa.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Children</i>. No, mother; but will you come and play again?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No no,?not now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i> Children</i>. But, mother, you promised us.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, but I can't now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do.
Run away in, sweet little darlings. (<i>She gets them into the room by
degrees and shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up
a piece of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops</i>.)

<span class="pagenum">[pg 43]</span>

No! (<i>Throws down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls
out</i>.) Helen, bring the Tree in. (<i>Goes to the table on the left,
opens a drawer, and stops again</i>.) No, no! it is quite impossible!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>coming in with the Tree</i>). Where shall I put it,
ma'am?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Here, in the middle of the floor.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Shall I get you anything else?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, thank you. I have all I want.
</p><br>
<p style="text-align: right;">
[<i>Exit</i> MAID
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>begins dressing the tree</i>). A candle here?and
flowers here?. The horrible man! It's all nonsense?there's nothing
wrong. The Tree shall be splendid! I will do everything I can think of
to please you, Torvald!?I will sing for you, dance for you?(HELMER
<i>comes in with some papers under his arm</i>.) Oh! are you back
already?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes. Has anyone been here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Here? No.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot Krogstad was here for a moment.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora, I can see from your manner that he has been here
begging you to say a good word for him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you
were to conceal from me the fact of his having been here; didn't he beg
that of you too?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, Torvald, but?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 44]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of
thing? To have any talk with a man like that, and give him any sort of
promise? And to tell me a lie into the bargain?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. A lie??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Didn't you tell me no one had been here? (<i>Shakes his
finger at her</i>.) My little song-bird must never do that again. A
song-bird must have a clean beak to chirp with?no false notes! (<i>Puts
his arm round her waist.</i>) That is so, isn't it? Yes, I am sure it
is. (<i>Lets her go</i>.) We will say no more about it. (<i>Sits down by
the stove</i>.) How warm and snug it is here! (<i>Turns over his
papers</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>after a short pause, during which she busies herself
with the Christmas Tree</i>). Torvald!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>: I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy dress ball
at the Stensborgs' the day after tomorrow.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And I am tremendously curious to see what you are going
to surprise me with.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It was very silly of me to want to do that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I can't hit upon anything that will do; everything I think
of seems so silly and insignificant.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Does my little Nora acknowledge that at last?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>standing behind his chair with her

<span class="pagenum">[pg 45]</span>

arms on the back of it</i>). Are you very busy, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What are all those papers?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Bank business.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Already?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. I have got authority from the retiring manager to
undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of
the work; and I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to
have everything in order for the new year.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Then that was why this poor Krogstad?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Hm!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>leans against the back of his chair and strokes his
hair</i>). If you hadn't been so busy I should have asked you a
tremendously big favour, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What is that? Tell me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. There is no one has such good taste as you. And I do so
want to look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn't you take me
in hand and decide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall
wear?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Aha! so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get
someone to come to her rescue?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit without your help.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> Very well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit
upon something.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That <i>is</i> nice of you. (<i>Goes to the Christmas Tree.
A short pause.)</i> How pretty the red flowers look?. But, tell me, was
it

<span class="pagenum">[pg 46]</span>

really something very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. He forged someone's name. Have you any idea what that
means?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Isn't it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so
heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step
of that kind.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Many a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he
has openly confessed his fault and taken his punishment.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Punishment??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out
of it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But do you think it would??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play
the hypocrite with everyone, how he has to wear a mask in the presence
of those near and dear to him, even before his own wife and children.
And about the children?that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons
the whole life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house
is full of the germs of evil.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>coming nearer him</i>). Are you sure of that?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 47]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as
a lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had
a deceitful mother.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Why do you only say?mother?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. It seems most commonly to be the mother's influence,
though naturally a bad father's would have the same result. Every lawyer
is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently
poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation; that is why I
say he has lost all moral character. (<i>Holds out his hands to
her.)</i> That is why my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead
his cause. Give me your hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me
your hand. There now, that's settled. I assure you it would be quite
impossible for me to work with him; I literally feel physically ill when
I am in the company of such people.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side
of the Christmas Tree</i>). How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot
to do.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>getting up and putting his papers in order</i>). Yes,
and I must try and read through some of these before dinner; and I must
think about your costume, too. And it is just possible I may have
something ready in gold paper to hang up on the Tree. (<i>Puts his hand
on her head.)</i> My precious little singing-bird! (<i>He goes into his
room and shuts the door after him.)</i>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>after a pause, whispers</i>). No, no?it

<span class="pagenum">[pg 48]</span>

isn't true. It's impossible; it must be impossible.
</p><br>
<p>
(<i>The</i> NURSE <i>opens the door on the left.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come
in to mamma.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, no, no! Don't let them come in to me! You stay with
them, Anne.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. Very well, ma'am. (<i>Shuts the door.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>pale with terror</i>). Deprave my little children?
Poison my home? (<i>A short pause. Then she tosses her head.</i>) It's
not true. It can't possibly be true.

 ACT II
</h2>
<p>
(THE SAME SCENE?<i>The Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
dishevelled branches.</i> NORA'S <i>cloak and hat are lying on the sofa.
She is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa
and takes up her cloak.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>drops the cloak</i>). Someone is coming now! (<i>Goes to
the door and listens.</i>) No?it is no one. Of course, no one will come
today, Christmas Day?nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps?(<i>opens the
door and looks out</i>.) No, nothing in the letter-box; it is quite
empty. (<i>Comes forward.</i>) What rubbish! of course he can't be in
earnest about it. Such a thing couldn't happen; it is impossible?I have
three little children.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 49]</span>
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(<i>Enter the</i> NURSE <i>from the room on the left, carrying a big
cardboard box.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Thanks; put it on the table.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i> (<i>doing so</i>). But it is very much in want of mending.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. What an idea! It can easily be put in order?just a little
patience.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I will go and get Mrs. Linde to come and help me with it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch
cold, ma'am, and make yourself ill.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas
presents, but?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Do they ask much for me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with
them.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with
them now as I was before.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their
mother if she went away altogether?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. Good heavens!?went away altogether?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often
wondered about?how could

<span class="pagenum">[pg 50]</span>

you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora's nurse.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A
poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that
wicked man didn't do a single thing for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to me when she was
confirmed, and when she was married.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>putting her arms round her neck</i>). Dear old Anne,
you were a good mother to me when I was little.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you
would?What nonsense I am talking! (<i>Opens the box.</i>) Go in to
them. Now I must?. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nurse</i>. I am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as
you, ma'am. (<i>Goes into the room on the left.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from
her</i>). If only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I
could be sure nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and
nonsense! No one will come. Only I mustn't think about it. I

<span class="pagenum">[pg 51]</span>

will brush my muff. What lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out
of my thoughts! One, two, three, four, five, six?(<i>Screams.</i>) Ah!
there is someone coming?. (<i>Makes a movement towards the door, but
stands irresolute</i>.)
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(<i>Enter</i> MRS. LINDE <i>from the hall, where she has taken off her
cloak and hat</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, it's you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is
there? How good of you to come!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I heard you were up asking for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something
you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here.
Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs',
who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan
fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I see; you are going to keep up the character.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald
had it made for me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any
idea?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. We will easily put that right. It is only some of the
trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's
all we want.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It <i>is</i> nice of you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>sewing</i>). So you are going to be dressed up
tomorrow, Nora. I will tell you what?I shall come in for a moment and
see

<span class="pagenum">[pg 52]</span>

you in your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you
for a delightful evening yesterday.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>gets up, and crosses the stage</i>). Well I don't think
yesterday was as pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a
little earlier, Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make
a house dainty and attractive.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your
father's daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as
depressed as he was yesterday?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that
he suffers from a <i>very</i> dangerous disease. He has consumption of
the spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed
all sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from
childhood, do you understand?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>dropping her sewing</i>). But, my dearest Nora,
how do you know anything about such things?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>walking about</i>). Pooh! When you have three children,
you get visits now and then from?from married women, who know something
of medical matters, and they talk about one thing and another.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>goes on sewing. A short silence</i>). Does Doctor
Rank come here every day?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Every day regularly. He is Torvald's most intimate friend,
and a great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But tell me this?is he

<span class="pagenum">[pg 53]</span>

perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he the kind of a man that is very anxious
to make himself agreeable?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Not in the least. What makes you think that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. When you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared
he had often heard my name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I
noticed that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I was. So how
could Doctor Rank??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond
of me that he wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he
used to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home,
so naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with
Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child
in many ways, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little
more experience. Let me tell you this?you ought to make an end of it
with Doctor Rank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What ought I to make an end of?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Of two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some
nonsense about a rich admirer who was to leave you money?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. An admirer who doesn't exist, unfortunately! But what then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, he is.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And has no one to provide for?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, no one; but?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 54]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And comes here every day?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I told you so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I don't understand you at all.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don't guess
who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a
thing! A friend of ours, who comes here every day! Do you realise what a
horribly painful position that would be?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Then it really isn't he?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head
for a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his
money afterwards.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor
Rank. Although I am quite sure that if I had asked him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But of course you won't.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly
be necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Behind your husband's back?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will
be behind his back too. I <i>must</i> make an end of it with him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>walking up and down</i>). A man can put a thing like
that straight much easier than a woman?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 55]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. One's husband, yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Nonsense! (<i>Standing still</i>.) When you pay off a debt
you get your bond back, don't you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, as a matter of course.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it
up?the nasty, dirty paper!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets
up slowly</i>). Nora, you are concealing something from me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Do I look as if I were?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Something has happened to you since yesterday
morning. Nora, what is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going nearer to her</i>). Christine! (<i>Listens</i>.)
Hush! there's Torvald come home. Do you mind going in to the children
for the present? Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let
Anne help you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>gathering some of the things together</i>).
Certainly?but I am not going away from here till we have had it out
with one another. (<i>She goes into the room, on the left, as Helmer
comes in from, the hall</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going up to</i> HELMAR). I have wanted you so much,
Torvald dear.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Was that the dressmaker?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in
order. You will see I shall look quite smart.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Wasn't that a happy thought of mine, now?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Splendid! But don't you think it is nice of me, too, to do
as you wish?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nice??because you do as your

<span class="pagenum">[pg 56]</span>

husband wishes? Well, well, you little rogue, I am sure you did not mean
it in that way. But I am not going to disturb you; you will want to be
trying on your dress, I expect.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I suppose you are going to work.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes. (<i>Shows her a bundle of papers</i>.) Look at that.
I have just been into the bank. (<i>Turns to go into his room</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very,
very prettily??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Would you do it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. I should like to hear what it is, first.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you
would be nice, and do what she wants.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Speak plainly.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song
rising and falling?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight,
Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora?you surely don't mean that request you made of me
this morning?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going near him</i>). Yes, Torvald, I beg you so
earnestly?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Have you really the courage to open up that question
again?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, dear, you <i>must</i> do as I ask; you <i>must</i> let
Krogstad keep his post in the bank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs.
Linde shall have.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 57]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could
just as well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to
give him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am
expected to?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake.
This fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me
so yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am
frightened to death of him?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that
scare you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> What do you mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Naturally you are thinking of your father.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes?yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these
malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly
they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if
the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had
not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> My little Nora, there is an important difference between
your father and me. Your father's reputation as a public official was
not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as
long as I hold my office.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We
ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home,

<span class="pagenum">[pg 58]</span>

and have no cares?you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I
beg you so earnestly?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it
impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I
mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager
has changed his mind at his wife's bidding?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And what if it did?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Of course!?if only this obstinate little person can get
her way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my
whole staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all
sorts of outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of
it, I can tell you. And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite
impossible for me to have Krogstad in the bank as long as I am manager.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Whatever is that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if
necessary?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, you could?couldn't you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And, I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when
we were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove
an incubus in after life. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once
on very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays
no restraint upon himself when other people are present. On the
contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with
me, and every minute it is "I say, Helmer, old fellow!" and that sort of
thing. I assure

<span class="pagenum">[pg 59]</span>

you it is extremely painful to me. He would make my position in the bank
intolerable.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Torvald, I don't believe you mean that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Don't you? Why not?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am
narrow-minded?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, just the opposite, dear?and it is exactly for that reason.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. It's the same thing. You say my point of view is
narrow-minded, so I must be so, too. Narrow-minded! Very well?I must
put an end to this. (<i>Goes to the hall door and calls.)</i> Helen!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What are you going to do?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>looking among his papers)</i>. Settle it.
(<i>Enter</i> MAID.) Look here; take this letter and go downstairs with
it at once. Find a messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick.
The address is on it, and here is the money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Very well, sir. (<i>Exit with the letter</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>putting his papers together</i>). Now, then, little
Miss Obstinate.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>). Torvald?what was that letter?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Krogstad's dismissal.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald,
call her back! Do it for my sake?for your own sake, for the children's
sake! Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don't know what that
letter can bring upon us.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 60]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. It's too late.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, it's too late.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in,
although really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn't it an insult
to think that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver's vengeance?
But I forgive you, nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to
your great love for me. (<i>Takes her in his arms.)</i> And that is as
it should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I
shall have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I
am man enough to take everything upon myself.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>in a horror-stricken voice</i>). What do you mean by
that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Everything I say?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>recovering herself</i>). You will never have to do that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That's right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and
wife should. That is how it shall be. (<i>Caressing her</i>.) Are you
content now? There! There!?not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole
thing is only the wildest fancy!?Now, you must go and play through the
Tarantella and practice with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner
office and shut the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much
noise as you please. (<i>Turns back at the door.)</i> And when Rank
comes, tell him where he will find me. (<i>Nods to her, takes his papers
and goes into his room, and shuts the door after him</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the
spot, and whispers</i>). He was

<span class="pagenum">[pg 61]</span>

capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in spite of
everything.?No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than that! Oh,
for some help, some way out of it. (<i>The door-bell rings</i>.) Doctor
Rank! Anything rather than that?anything, whatever it is! (<i>She puts
her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door and
opens it. </i>RANK<i> is standing without, hanging up his coat. During
the following dialogue it begins to grow dark</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Good-day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn't go
into Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. And you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>brings him in and shuts the door after him</i>). Oh, you
know very well I always have time for you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Well, does that alarm you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely
to happen?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I
certainly didn't expect it to happen so soon.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>gripping him by the arm</i>). What have you found out?
Doctor Rank, you must tell me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>sitting down by the stove</i>). It is all up with me.
And it can't be helped.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>with a sigh of relief</i>). Is it about yourself?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Who else? It is no use lying to one's self. I am the most
wretched of all my patients,

<span class="pagenum">[pg 62]</span>

Mrs. Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my internal economy.
Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting in the
church-yard.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What an ugly thing to say!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is
that I shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall
only make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall
know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution
will begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's refined
nature gives him an unconquerable disgust of everything that is ugly;
I won't have him in my sick-room.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, but, Doctor Rank?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I won't have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door
to him. As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall
send you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that
the loathsome end has begun.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You are quite absurd to-day. And I wanted you so much to be
in a really good humour.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. With death stalking beside me??To have to pay this penalty
for another man's sin! Is there any justice in that? And in every single
family, in one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being
exacted?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>putting her hands over her ears</i>). Rubbish! Do talk
of something cheerful.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor
innocent spine has to suffer for my father's youthful amusements.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 63]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>sitting at the table on the left</i>). I suppose you
mean that he was too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't
you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, and to truffles.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these
nice things should take their revenge on our bones.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Especially that they should revenge themselves on the
unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying
them.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, that's the saddest part of it all.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>with a searching look at her</i>). Hm!?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>after a short pause</i>). Why did you smile?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rand</i>. No, it was you that laughed.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>rising</i>). You are a greater rascal than I thought.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I am in a silly mood today.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. So it seems.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>putting her hands on his shoulders</i>). Dear, dear
Doctor Rank, death mustn't take you away from Torvald and me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. It is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are
gone are soon forgotten.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looking at him anxiously</i>). Do you believe that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. People form new ties, and then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Who will form new ties?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 64]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are
already on the high road to it, I think. What did that Mrs. Linde want
here last night?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oho!?you don't mean to say you are jealous of poor
Christine?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I
am done for, this woman will?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in that room.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. To-day again. There, you see.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. She has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul,
how unreasonable you are! (<i>Sits down on the sofa</i>.) Be nice now,
Doctor Rank, and to-morrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance,
and you can imagine I am doing it all for you?and for Torvald too, of
course. (<i>Takes various things out of the box.</i>) Doctor Rank, come
and sit down here, and I will show you something.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>sitting down</i>). What is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Just look at those.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Silk stockings.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely? It is so dark here now,
but to-morrow?. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet. Oh, well,
you may have leave to look at the legs too.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Hm!?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Why are you looking so critical? Don't you think they will
fit me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I have no means of forming an opinion about that.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 65]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looks at him for a moment</i>). For shame! (<i>Hits him
lightly on the ear with the stockings</i>.) That's to punish you.
(<i>Folds them up again</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. And what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Not a single thing more, for being so naughty. (<i>She
looks among the things, humming to herself</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>after a short silence</i>). When I am sitting here,
talking to you as intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what
would have become of me if I had never come into this house.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I believe you do feel thoroughly at home
with us.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>in a lower voice, looking straight in front of him</i>).
And to be obliged to leave it all?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Nonsense, you are not going to leave it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>as before</i>). And not be able to leave behind one the
slightest token of one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting
regret?nothing but an empty place which the first comer can fill as
well as any other.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And if I asked you now for a?? No!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. For what?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. For a big proof of your friendship?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I mean a tremendously big favour?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Would you really make me so happy for once?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Ah, but you don't know what it is yet.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. No?but tell me.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 66]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all
reason; it means advice, and help, and a favour?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. The bigger a thing it is the better. I can't conceive what
it is you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your confidence?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. More than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best
friend, and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is
something you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly, how
inexpressibly deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment
hesitate to give his life for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>leaning toward her</i>). Nora?do you think he is the
only one??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>with a slight start</i>). The only one??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. The only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>sadly</i>). Is that it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I was determined you should know it before I went away, and
there will never be a better opportunity than this. Now you know it,
Nora. And now you know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no
one else.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>rises deliberately and quietly</i>). Let me pass.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>makes room for her to pass him, but sits still</i>). Nora!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>at the hall door</i>). Helen, bring in the lamp.
(<i>Goes over to the stove</i>.) Dear Doctor Rank, that was really
horrid of you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. To have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that
horrid?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 67]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. What do you mean? Did you know?? (MAID <i>enters with
lamp, puts it down on the table, and goes out</i>.) Nora?Mrs.
Helmer?tell me, had you any idea of this?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn't. I
really can't tell you?To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We
were getting on so nicely.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Bank</i>. Well, at all events you know now that you can command me,
body and soul. So won't you speak out?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looking at him</i>). After what happened?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I beg you to let me know what it is.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I can't tell you anything now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in that way. Let me have
permission to do for you whatever a man may do.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don't need
any help at all. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on
my part. It really is so?of course it is! (<i>Sits down in the
rocking-chair, and looks at him with a smile</i>.) You are a nice sort
of man, Doctor Rank!?don't you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp
has come?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better go?forever?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here
just as before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, but you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. It is just that, that put me on the

<span class="pagenum">[pg 68]</span>

wrong track. You are a riddle to me. I have often thought that you would
almost as soon be in my company as in Helmer's.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes?you see there are some people one loves best, and
others whom one would almost always rather have as companions.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, there is something in that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. When I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I
always thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids'
room, because they never moralized at all, and talked to each other
about such entertaining things.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I see?it is their place I have taken.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>jumping-up and going to him</i>). Oh, dear, nice Doctor
Rank, I never meant that at all. But surely you can understand that
being with Torvald is a little like being with papa?(<i>Enter</i> MAID
<i>from the hall</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. If you please, ma'am. (<i>Whispers and hands her a
card</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>glancing at the card</i>). Oh! (<i>Puts it in her
pocket</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Is there anything wrong?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, no, not in the least. It is only something?It is my
new dress?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. What? Your dress is lying there.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it.
Torvald mustn't know about it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Oho! Then that was the great secret.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Of course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner
room. Keep him as long as?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Make your mind easy; I won't let him escape. (<i>Goes
into</i> HELMER'S <i>room</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 69]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>to the</i> MAID). And he is standing waiting in the
kitchen?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Yes; he came up the back stairs.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But didn't you tell him no one was in?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Yes, but it was no good.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. He won't go away?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. No; he says he won't until he has seen you, ma'am.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Well, let him come in?but quietly. Helen, you mustn't say
anything about it to any one. It is a surprise for my husband.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. (<i>Exit</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. This dreadful thing is going to happen. It will happen in
spite of me! No, no, no, it can't happen?it shan't happen! (<i>She
bolts the door of</i> HELMER'S <i>room. The</i> MAID <i>opens the hall
door for</i> KROGSTAD <i>and shuts it after him. He is wearing a fur
coat, high boots and a fur cap</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>advancing towards him</i>). Speak low?my husband is at
home.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. No matter about that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you want of me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. An explanation of something.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Make haste then. What is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. You know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I
could on your side, but it was no good.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows
what I can expose you to, and yet he ventures?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 70]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I didn't suppose so at all. It would not be the least
like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Certainly?all the respect he deserves. But since you
have kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose
that you have a little clearer idea than you had yesterday, of what it
actually is that you have done?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. More than you could ever teach me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What is it you want of me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Only to see how you were, Mrs. Helmer. I have been
thinking about you all day long. A mere cashier?a quill-driver,
a?well, a man like me?even he has a little of what is called feeling,
you know.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Show it, then; think of my little children.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Have you and your husband thought of mine? But never
mind about that. I only wanted to tell you that you need not take this
matter too seriously. In the first place there will be no accusation
made on my part.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, of course not; I was sure of that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. The whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no
reason why anyone should know anything about it. It will remain a secret
between us three.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 71]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. My husband must never get to know anything about it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. How will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand
that you can pay the balance that is owing?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, not just at present.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the
money soon?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No expedient that I mean to make use of.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Well, in any case, it would have been of no use to you
now. If you stood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would
never part with your bond.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Tell me what purpose you mean to put it to.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I shall only preserve it?keep it in my possession. No
one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of
it. So that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate
resolution?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It has.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. If you had it in your mind to run away from your home?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I had.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Or even something worse?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How could you know that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Give up the idea.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How did you know I had thought of <i>that?</i>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Most of us think of that at first. I did, too?but I
hadn't the courage.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>faintly</i>). No more had I.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 72]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>in a tone of relief)</i>. No, that's it, isn't
it?you hadn't the courage either?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, I haven't?I haven't.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Besides, it would have been a great piece of folly.
Once the first storm at home is over?. I have a letter for your husband
in my pocket.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Telling him everything?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. In as lenient a manner as I possibly could.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>quickly)</i>. He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I
will find some means of getting money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer, but I think I told you just how?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I am not speaking of what I owe you. Tell me what sum you
are asking my husband for, and I will get the money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I am not asking your husband for a penny.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you want, then?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I will tell you. I want to rehabilitate myself, Mrs.
Helmer; I want to get on; and in that your husband must help me. For the
last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonourable,
and all that time I have been struggling in most restricted
circumstances. I was content to work my way up step by step. Now I am
turned out, and I am not going to be satisfied with merely being taken
into favour again. I want to get on, I tell you. I want to get into the
Bank again, in a higher position. Your husband must make a place for
me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That he will never do!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 73]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. He will; I know him; he dare not protest. And as soon
as I am in there again with him, then you will see! Within a year I
shall be the manager's right hand. It will be Nils Krogstad and not
Torvald Helmer who manages the Bank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That's a thing you will never see!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Do you mean that you will??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I have courage enough for it now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Oh, you can't frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You will see, you will see.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black
water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible
and unrecognizable, with your hair fallen out?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You can't frighten me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Nor you me. People don't do such things, Mrs. Helmer.
Besides, what use would it be? I should have him completely in my power
all the same.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Afterwards? When I am no longer?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Have you forgot that it is I who have the keeping of
your reputation? (<i>Nora stands speechlessly looking at him.)</i> Well,
now, I have warned you. Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had
my letter, I shall expect a message from him. And be sure you remember
that it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this
again. I will never forgive him for that. Good-bye, Mrs. Helmer.
(<i>Exit through the hall.)</i>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>goes to the hall door, opens it slightly and
listens</i>). He is going. He is not putting

<span class="pagenum">[pg 74]</span>

the letter in the box. Oh, no, no, that's impossible! (<i>Opens the door
by degrees.</i>) What is that? He is standing outside. He is not going
downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can he?? (<i>A letter drops into the box;
then</i> KROGSTAD'S <i>footsteps are heard, till they die away as he
goes downstairs.</i> NORA <i>utters a stifled cry, and runs across the
room to the table by the sofa. A short pause</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. In the letter-box. (<i>Steals across to the hall-door</i>.)
There it lies?Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!
</p><br>
<p>
(MRS. LINDE <i>comes in from the room on the left, carrying the
dress</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. There, I can't see anything more to mend now. Would
you like to try it on??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>in a hoarse whisper</i>). Christine, come here.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>throwing the dress down on the sofa</i>). What is
the matter with you? You look so agitated!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Come here. Do you see that letter? There, look?you can see
it through the glass in the letter-box.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, I see it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That letter is from Krogstad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nora?it was Krogstad who lent you the money!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, and now Torvald will know all about it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Believe me, Nora, that's the best thing for both of you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You don't know all. I forged a name.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Good heavens?!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 75]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I only want to say this to you, Christine?you must be my
witness.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Your witness! What do you mean? What am I to??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. If I should go out of my mind?and it might easily happen?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nora!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Or if anything else should happen to me?anything, for
instance, that might prevent my being here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nora! Nora! you are quite out of your mind.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And if it should happen that there were someone who wanted
to take all the responsibility, all the blame, you understand?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, yes?but how can you suppose??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Then you must be my witness, that it is not true,
Christine. I am not out of my mind at all; I am in my right senses now,
and I tell you no one else has known anything about it; I and I alone,
did the whole thing. Remember that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I will, indeed. But I don't understand all this.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How should you understand it? A wonderful thing is going to
happen.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. A wonderful thing?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, a wonderful thing!?But it is so terrible, Christine;
it <i>mustn't</i> happen, not for all the world.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I will go at once and see Krogstad.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Don't go to him; he will do you some harm.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 76]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. There was a time when he would gladly do anything for
my sake.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. He?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Where does he live?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How should I know?? Yes (<i>feeling in her pocket</i>)
here is his card. But the letter, the letter?!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>calls from his room, knocking at the door</i>). Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>cries out anxiously</i>). Oh, what's that? What do you want?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Don't be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have
locked the door. Are you trying on your dress?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, that's it. I look so nice, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>who has read the card</i>) I see he lives at the
corner here.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, but it's no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying
there in the box.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. And your husband keeps the key?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, always.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Krogstad must ask for his letter back unread, he must
find some pretence?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. But it is just at this time that Torvald generally?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You must delay him. Go in to him in the meantime. I
will come back as soon as I can. (<i>She goes out hurriedly through the
hall door</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>goes to</i> HELMER'S <i>door, opens it and peeps
in</i>). Torvald!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>from the inner room</i>). Well? May I venture at last
to come into my own room

<span class="pagenum">[pg 77]</span>

again? Come along, Rank, now you will see?(<i> Halting in the
doorway</i>.) But what is this?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What is what, dear?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Rank led me to expect a splendid transformation.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>in the doorway</i>). I understood so, but evidently I
was mistaken.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, nobody is to have the chance of admiring me in my
dress until to-morrow.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But, my dear Nora, you look so worn out. Have you been
practising too much?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, I have not practised at all.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But you will need to?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can't get on a bit
without you to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Oh, we will soon work it up again.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that you will! I am so
nervous about it?all the people?. You must give yourself up to me
entirely this evening. Not the tiniest bit of business?you mustn't even
take a pen in your hand. Will you promise, Torvald dear?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. I promise. This evening I will be wholly and absolutely
at your service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by the way, first of
all I will just?(<i>Goes toward the hall-door</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What are you going to do there?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Only see if any letters have come.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, no! don't do that, Torvald!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Why not?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Torvald, please don't. There is nothing there.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well, let me look. (<i>Turns to go to

<span class="pagenum">[pg 78]</span>

the letter-box.</i> NORA, <i>at the piano, plays the first bars of
the Tarantella</i>. HELMER <i>stops in the doorway</i>.) Aha!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I can't dance to-morrow if I don't practise with you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>going up to her</i>). Are you really so afraid of it, dear?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once;
there is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me,
Torvald dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. With great pleasure, if you wish me to. (<i>Sits down at
the piano</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated
shawl. She hastily drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the
front of the stage and calls out</i>). Now play for me! I am going to
dance!
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(HELMER <i>plays and</i> NORA <i>dances</i>. RANK <i>stands by the piano
behind</i> HELMER, <i>and looks on</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>as he plays</i>). Slower, slower!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I can't do it any other way.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Not so violently, Nora!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. This is the way.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>stops playing</i>). No, no?that is not a bit right.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>laughing and swinging the tambourine</i>). Didn't I tell
you so?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Let me play for her.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>getting up</i>). Yes, do. I can correct her better then.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 79]</span>
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(RANK <i>sits down at the piano and plays. Nora dances more and more
wildly</i>. HELMER <i>has taken up a position beside the stove, and
during her dance gives her frequent instructions. She does not seem to
hear him; her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders; she pays no
attention to it, but goes on dancing. Enter</i> MRS. LINDE.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>standing as if spell-bound in the doorway</i>). Oh!?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>as she dances</i>). Such fun, Christine!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. My dear darling Nora, you are dancing as if your life
depended on it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. So it does.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you.
(RANK <i>stops playing, and,</i> NORA <i>suddenly stands still</i>.
HELMER <i>goes up to her.</i>) I could never have believed it. You have
forgotten everything I taught you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>throwing away the tambourine</i>). There, you see.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You will want a lot of coaching.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to
the last minute. Promise me that, Torvald!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You can depend on me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You must not think of anything but me, either to-day or
to-morrow; you mustn't open a single letter?not even open the
letter-box?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Ah, you are still afraid of that fellow??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, indeed I am.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 80]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter
from him lying there.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I don't know; I think there is; but you must not read
anything of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come between us till this
is all over.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>whispers to</i> HELMER). You mustn't contradict her.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>taking her in his arms</i>). The child shall have her
way. But to-morrow night, after you have danced?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Then you will be free. (<i>The</i> MAID <i>appears in the
doorway to the right</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Dinner is served, ma'am.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. We will have champagne, Helen.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i>. Very good, ma'am.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Hullo!?are we going to have a banquet? (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, a champagne banquet till the small hours. (<i>Calls
out</i>.) And a few macaroons, Helen?lots, just for once!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Come, come, don't be so wild and nervous. Be my own
little skylark, as you used.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and you too, Doctor Rank.
Christine, you must, help me to do up my hair.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>whispers to</i> HELMER <i>as they go out</i>). I suppose
there is nothing?she is not expecting anything?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Far from it, my dear fellow; it is simply nothing more
than this childish nervousness I was telling you of. (<i>They go into
the right-hand room</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Well!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 81]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Gone out of town.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I could tell from your face.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. He is coming home tomorrow evening. I wrote a note
for him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You should have let it alone; you must prevent nothing.
After all, it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. What is it that you are waiting for?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>, Oh, you wouldn't understand. Go in to them. I will come in
a moment. (MRS. LINDE <i>goes into the dining-room.</i> NORA <i>stands
still for a little while, as if to compose herself. Then she looks at
her watch</i>.) Five o'clock. Seven hours till midnight; and then
four-and-twenty hours till the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will
be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>from the doorway on the right</i>). Where's my little skylark?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going to him with her arms out-stretched</i>). Here she is!

<h2>
 ACT III
</h2>
<p>
(THE SAME SCENE?<i>The table has been placed in the middle of the
stage, with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door
into the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above</i>.
MRS. LINDE <i>is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a
book; she tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts.
Every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer
door</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 82]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>looking at her watch</i>). Not yet?and the time
is nearly up. If only he does not?. (<i>Listens again</i>.) Ah, there
he is. (<i>Goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light
footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers</i>.) Come in. There is
no one here.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>in the doorway</i>). I found a note from you at
home. What does this mean?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk
with you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should
be here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. It is impossible where I live; there is no private
entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep,
and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>coming into the room</i>). Are the Helmers really at
a dance tonight?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, why not?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Certainly?why not?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Can we two have anything to talk about?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. We have a great deal to talk about.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I shouldn't have thought so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, you have never properly understood me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Was there anything else to understand except what was
obvious to all the world?a heartless woman jilts a man when a more
lucrative chance turns up.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 83]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all
that? And do you believe that I did it with a light heart?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Didn't you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nils, did you really think that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you
did at the time?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you,
it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>wringing his hands</i>). So that was it. And all
this?only for the sake of money.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and
two little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils; your prospects
seemed hopeless then.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over
for any one else's sake.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Indeed I don't know. Many a time did I ask myself if
I had a right to do it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>more gently</i>). When I lost you, it was as if all
the solid ground went from under my feet. Look at me now?I am a
shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. But help may be near.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. It <i>was</i> near; but then you came and stood in my way.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I
learnt it was your place I was going to take in the bank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it,
are you not going to give it up to me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, because that would not benefit you in the least.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 84]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Oh, benefit, benefit?I would have done it whether or no.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I have learnt to act prudently. Life, and hard,
bitter necessity have taught me that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Then life has taught you something very reasonable.
But deeds you must believe in?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. What do you mean by that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to
some wreckage.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I had good reason to say so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some
wreckage?no one to mourn for, no one to care for.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. It was your own choice.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. There was no other choice, then.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Well, what now?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people
could join forces?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. What are you saying?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a
better chance than each on their own.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Christine!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. What do you suppose brought me to town?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Do you mean that you gave me a thought?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I could not endure life without work. All my life, as
long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and
only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in

<span class="pagenum">[pg 85]</span>

the world?my life is so dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There
is not the least pleasure in working for one's self. Nils, give me
someone and something to work for.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I don't trust that. It is nothing but a woman's
overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer
of your self.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Could you really do it? Tell me?do you know all about
my past life?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. And do you know what they think of me here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have
been quite another man.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I am certain of it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Is it too late now?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am
sure you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage,
then??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I want to be a mother to someone, and your children
need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real
character?I can dare anything together with you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>grasps her hands</i>). Thanks, thanks, Christine!
Now I shall find a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but
I forgot?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>listening</i>). Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 86]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Why? What is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may
expect them back.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Yes, yes?I will go. But it is all no use. Of course
you are not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, I know all about that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. And in spite of that have you the courage to??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. I understand very well to what lengths a man like you
might be driven by despair.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. If I could only undo what I have done!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Are you sure of that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Quite sure, but?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i> (<i>with a searching look at her</i>). Is that what it
all means??that you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me
frankly. Is that it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another's
sake, doesn't do it a second time.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I will ask for my letter back.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, no.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Yes, of course I will. I will wait here till Helmer
comes; I will tell him he must give me my letter back?that it only
concerns my dismissal?that he is not to read it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 87]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad.</i> But, tell me, wasn't it for that very purpose that you
asked me to meet you here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four
hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed
incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This
unhappy secret must be enclosed; they must have a complete understanding
between them, which is impossible with all this concealment and
falsehood going on.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But
there is one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>listening</i>). You must be quick and go! The
dance is over; we are not safe a moment longer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I will wait for you below.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, do. You must see me back to my door.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Krogstad</i>. I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune
in my life! (<i>Goes out through the outer door. The door between the
room and the hall remains open</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak
ready</i>). What a difference! What a difference! Someone to work for
and live for?a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I
wish they would be quick and come. (<i>Listens.</i>) Ah, there they are
now. I must put on my things. (<i>Takes up her hat and cloak</i>.
HELMER'S <i>and</i> NORA'S <i>voices are heard outside; a key is turned,
and</i> HELMER <i>brings</i> NORA <i>almost by force into the hall. She
is in an Italian costume with a large black

<span class="pagenum">[pg 88]</span>

shawl round her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is
flying open</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with
him</i>). No, no, no!?don't take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I
don't want to leave so early.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But, my dearest Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Please, Torvald dear?please, <i>please</i>?only an hour more.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our
agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing
there. (<i>He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her
resistance</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Good evening.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Christine!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You here, so late, Mrs. Linde?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora
in her dress.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Have you been sitting here waiting for me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already
gone upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away again without having
seen you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>taking off</i> NORA'S <i>shawl</i>). Yes, take a good
look at her. I think she is worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs.
Linde?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, indeed she is.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so
at the dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person.
What are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to
bring her away by force.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 89]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it
were only for half an hour.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Listen to her, Mrs. Linde! She had danced her Tarantella,
and it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved?although possibly
the performance was a trifle too realistic?little more so, I mean,
than was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind
about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success?she had made a
tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there
after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little
Capri maiden?my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say?on my
arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and,
as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit
ought always to be effective, Mrs. Linde; but that is what I cannot make
Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. (<i>Throws his domino on a
chair, and opens the door of his room</i>.) Hullo! it's all dark in
here. Oh, of course?excuse me?. (<i>He goes in, and lights some
candles</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>in a hurried and breathless whisper</i>). Well?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde.</i> (<i>in a low voice</i>). I have had a talk with him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes, and?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>in an expressionless voice</i>). I knew it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde.</i> You have nothing to be afraid of

<span class="pagenum">[pg 90]</span>

as far as Krogstad is concerned; but you must tell him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I won't tell him.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Then the letter will.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush?!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>coming in again</i>). Well, Mrs. Linde, have you
admired her?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, and now I will say good-night.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i> (<i>taking it</i>). Yes, thank you, I had very nearly
forgotten it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. So you knit?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Of course.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Do you know, you ought to embroider?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Really? Why?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold
the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the
right?like this?with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Yes, perhaps?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But in the case of knitting?that can never be anything
but ungraceful; look here?the arms close together, the knitting-needles
going up and down?it has a sort of Chinese effect?. That was really
excellent champagne they gave us.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Well,?good-night, Nora, and don't be self-willed any
more.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That's right, Mrs. Linde.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 91]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Linde</i>. Good-night, Mr. Helmer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>accompanying her to the door</i>). Good-night,
good-night. I hope you will get home all right. I should be very happy
to?but you haven't any great distance to go. Good-night, good-night.
(<i>She goes out; he shuts the door after her and comes in again</i>.)
Ah!?at last we have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that
woman.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. No, not in the least.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Nor sleepy?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily
lively. And you??you really look both tired and sleepy.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you
stay there any longer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>kissing her on the forehead</i>). Now my little
skylark is speaking reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank
was in this evening?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him at all.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen
him in such good form. (<i>Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer
to her</i>.) It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be
all alone with you?you fascinating, charming little darling!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 92]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure??at all the
beauty that is mine, all my very own?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going to the other side of the table</i>). You mustn't
say things like that to me tonight.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>following her</i>). You have still got the Tarantella
in your blood, I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever.
Listen?the guests are beginning to go now. (<i>In a lower voice</i>.)
Nora?soon the whole house will be quiet.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, I hope so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a
party with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from
you, and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then??do
you know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we
are secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that
no one suspects there is anything between us.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, yes?I know very well your thoughts are with me all
the time.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over
your beautiful young shoulders?on your lovely neck?then I imagine that
you are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and
I am bringing you for the first time into our home?to be alone with you
for the first time?quite alone with my shy little darling! All this
evening I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive
figures of the

<span class="pagenum">[pg 93]</span>

Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer, and that
was why I brought you down so early?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won't?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What's that? You're joking, my little Nora! You
won't?you won't? Am I not your husband?? (<i>A knock is heard at the
outer door</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>starting</i>). Did you hear??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>going into the hall</i>). Who is it?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>outside</i>). It is I. May I come in for a moment?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>in a fretful whisper</i>). Oh, what does he want now?
(<i>Aloud</i>.) Wait a minute? (<i>Unlocks the door</i>.) Come, that's
kind of you not to pass by our door.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like
to look in. (<i>With a swift glance round</i>.) Ah, yes!?these dear
familiar rooms. You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well
upstairs too.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't one enjoy
everything in this world??at any rate as much as one can, and as long
as one can. The wine was capital?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Especially the champagne.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I
managed to put away!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight, too.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Did he?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 94]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a
well-spent day?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well spent? I am afraid I can't take credit for that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>clapping him on the back</i>). But I can, you know!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some
scientific investigation today.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Exactly.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Just listen!?little Nora talking about scientific
investigations!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And may I congratulate you on the result?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Indeed you may.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Was it favourable, then.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. The best possible, for both doctor and patient?certainty.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>quickly and searchingly</i>). Certainty?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I entitled to make a merry
evening of it after that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. I think so too, so long as you don't have to pay for it
in the morning.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Oh well, one can't have anything in this life without
paying for it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Doctor Rank?are you fond of fancy-dress balls?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Tell me?what shall we two wear at the next?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 95]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Little featherbrain!?are you thinking of the next already?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume
for that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Let your wife go dressed just as she is in every-day life.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That was really very prettily turned. But can't you tell
us what you will be?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about
that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Well?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> That's a good joke!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. There is a big black hat?have you never heard of hats that
make you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>suppressing a smile</i>). Yes, you are quite right.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me
a cigar?one of the dark Havanas.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. With the greatest pleasure. (<i>Offers him his case</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i> (<i>takes a cigar and cuts off the end</i>). Thanks.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>striking a match</i>). Let me give you a light.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Thank you. (<i>She holds the match for him to light his
cigar</i>.) And now good-bye!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Good-bye, good-bye, dear old man!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 96]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. Thank you for that wish.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Wish me the same.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Rank</i>. You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the
light. (<i>He nods to them both and goes out</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>in a subdued voice</i>). He has drunk more than he ought.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>absently</i>). Maybe. (HELMER <i>takes a bunch of keys
out of his pocket and goes into the hall</i>.) Torvald! what are you
going to do there?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Empty the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no
room to put the newspaper in to-morrow morning.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Are you going to work to-night?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You know quite well I'm not. What is this? Some one has
been at the lock.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. At the lock?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have
thought the maid?. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>quickly</i>). Then it must have been the children?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last
I have got it open. (<i>Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and
calls to the kitchen</i>.) Helen!?Helen, put out the light over the
front door. (<i>Goes back into the room and shuts the door into the
hall. He holds out his hand full of letters</i>.) Look at that?look
what a heap of them there are. (<i>Turning them over</i>.) What on earth
is that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>at the window</i>). The letter?No! Torvald, no!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 97]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Two cards?of Rank's.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Of Doctor Rank's?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>looking at them</i>). Doctor Rank. They were on the
top. He must have put them in when he went out.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Is there anything written on them?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> There is a black cross over the name. Look there?what an
uncomfortable idea! It looks as If he were announcing his own death.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> It is just what he is doing.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything
to you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his
leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> My poor old friend. Certainly I knew we should not have
him very long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a
wounded animal.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a
word?don't you think so, Torvald?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>walking up and down</i>). He has so grown into our
lives. I can't think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his
sufferings and his loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our
sunlit happiness. Well, perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway.
(<i>Standing still.</i>) And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown
quite upon each other now. (<i>Puts his arms around her.</i>) My darling
wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know,
Nora, I have often wished that you

<span class="pagenum">[pg 98]</span>

might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's
blood, and everything, for your sake.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly</i>).
Now you must read your letters, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> With the thought of your friend's death?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly
has come between us?the thought of the horrors of death. We must try
and rid our minds of that. Until then?we will each go to our own room.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>hanging on his neck</i>). Good-night,
Torvald?Good-night!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>kissing her on the forehead</i>). Good-night, my
little singing-bird. Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters
through. (<i>He takes his letters and goes into his room, shutting the
door after him.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>gropes distractedly about, seizes</i> HELMER'S
<i>domino, throws it round her, while she says in quick, hoarse,
spasmodic whispers</i>). Never to see him again. Never! Never! (<i>Puts
her shawl over her head.</i>) Never to see my children again
either?never again. Never! Never!?Ah! the icy, black water?the
unfathomable depths?If only it were over! He has got it now?now he is
reading it. Good-bye, Torvald and my children! (<i>She is about to rush
out through the hall, when</i> HELMER

<span class="pagenum">[pg 99]</span>

<i>opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his
hand.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Nora!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Ah!?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>holding her back</i>). Where are you going?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>trying to get free</i>). You shan't save me, Torvald!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>reeling</i>). True? Is this true, that I read here?
Horrible! No, no?it is impossible that it can be true.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Oh, don't let us have any silly excuses.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>taking a step towards him</i>). Torvald?!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Miserable creature?what have you done?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not
take it upon yourself.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> No tragedy airs, please. (<i>Locks the hall door.</i>)
Here you shall stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what
you have done? Answer me? Do you understand what you have done?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looks steadily at him and says with a

<span class="pagenum">[pg 100]</span>

growing look of coldness in her face</i>). Yes, now I am beginning
to understand thoroughly.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>walking about the room</i>). What a horrible
awakening! All these eight years?she who was my joy and pride?a
hypocrite, a liar?worse, worse?a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of
it all!?For shame! For shame! (NORA <i>is silent and looks steadily at
him. He stops in front of her.</i>) I ought to have suspected that
something of the sort would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All
your father's want of principle?be silent!?all your father's want of
principle has come out in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of
duty?How I am punished for having winked at what he did! I did it for
your sake, and this is how you repay me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes, that's just it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined
all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an
unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes
of me, give me any orders he pleases?I dare not refuse. And I must sink
to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> When I am out of the way, you will be free.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty
of those ready, too. What good would it be to me if you were out of the
way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known
everywhere; and if

<span class="pagenum">[pg 101]</span>

he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your
criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all?that
it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this?you
whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you
understand now what it is you have done for me?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>coldly and quietly</i>). Yes.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must
come to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell
you. I must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be
hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if
everything between us were as before?but naturally only in the eyes of
the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of
course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not
trust them to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to one
whom I have loved so dearly, and whom I still?. No, that is all over.
From this moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is
to save the remains, the fragments, the appearance?
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(<i>A ring is heard at the front-door bell.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>with a start</i>). What is that? So late! Can the
worst?? Can he?? Hide yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(NORA <i>stands motionless.</i> HELMER <i>goes and unlocks the hall door.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 102]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>half-dressed, comes to the door</i>). A letter for the mistress.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Give it to me. (<i>Takes the letter, and shuts the
door.</i>) Yes, it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it
myself.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Yes, read it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>standing by the lamp</i>). I scarcely have the courage
to do it. It may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. (<i>Tears
open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper
enclosed, and gives a shout of joy.</i>) Nora! (<i>She looks at him,
questioningly.</i>) Nora! No, I must read it once again?. Yes, it is
true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> And I?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> You too, of course; we are both saved, both saved, both
you and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he regrets and
repents?that a happy change in his life?never mind what he says! We
are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!?no,
first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see?. (<i>Takes a
look at the bond.</i>) No, no, I won't look at it. The whole thing shall
be nothing but a bad dream to me. (<i>Tears up the bond and both
letters, throws them all into the stove, and watches them burn.</i>)
There?now it doesn't exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve
you?. These must have been three dreadful days for you, Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> I have fought a hard fight these three days.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 103]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> And suffered agonies, and seen no way out but?. No, we
won't call any of the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and
keep saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to me, Nora. You
don't seem to realise that it is all over. What is this??such a cold,
set face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you don't feel as if
you could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I
swear it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you
did out of love for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> That is true.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> You have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband.
Only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used.
But do you suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don't
understand how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on
me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this
womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my
eyes. You must not think any more about the hard things I said in my
first moment of consternation, when I thought everything was going to
overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven
you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Thank you for your forgiveness. (<i>She goes out through
the door to the right.</i>)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> No, don't go?. (<i>Looks in.</i>) What are you doing in
there?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>from within</i>). Taking off my fancy dress.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 104]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>standing at the open door</i>). Yes, do. Try and calm
yourself, and make your mind easy again, my frightened little
singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter
you under. (<i>Walks up and down by the door.</i>) How warm and cosy our
home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect you like a
hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to
your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe
me. To-morrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon
everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to
assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the
certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of
such a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no
idea what a true man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so
indescribably sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he
has forgiven his wife?forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It
seems as if that had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given
her a new life, so to speak; and she is in a way become both wife and
child to him. So you shall be for me after this, my little scared,
helpless darling. Have no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank
and open with me, and I will serve as will and conscience both to you?.
What is this? Not gone to bed? Have you changed your things?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>in everyday dress</i>). Yes, Torvald, I have changed my
things now.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 105]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> But what for??so late as this.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> I shall not sleep tonight.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> But, my dear Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>looking at her watch</i>). It is not so very late. Sit
down here, Torvald. You and I have much to say to one another. (<i>She
sits down at one side of the table</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Nora?what is this??this cold, set face?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> Sit down. It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over
with you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>sits down at the opposite side of the table</i>). You
alarm me, Nora!?and I don't understand you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> No, that is just it. You don't understand me, and I have
never understood you either?before tonight. No, you mustn't interrupt
me. You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of
accounts.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What do you mean by that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>after a short silence</i>). Isn't there one thing that
strikes you as strange in our sitting here like this?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What is that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> We have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to
you that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife,
have had a serious conversation?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What do you mean by serious?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> In all these eight years?longer than that?from the very
beginning of our acquaintance,

<span class="pagenum">[pg 106]</span>

we have never exchanged a word on any serious subject.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Was it likely that I would be continually and forever
telling you about worries that you could not help me to bear?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we
have never sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of
anything.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> But, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been
greatly wronged, Torvald?first by papa and then by you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What! By us two?by us two, who have loved you better
than anyone else in in the world?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>shaking her head</i>). You have never loved me. You have
only thought it pleasant to be in love with me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> Nora, what do I hear you saying?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora.</i> It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with
papa, he told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same
opinions; and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he
would not have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with
me just as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with
you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer.</i> What sort of an expression is that to use about our
marriage?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>undisturbed</i>). I mean that I was simply

<span class="pagenum">[pg 107]</span>

transferred from papa's hands into yours. You arranged everything
according to your own taste, and so I got the same tastes as you?or
else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which?I think sometimes
the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it, it seems to me
as if I had been living here like a poor woman?just from hand to mouth.
I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald. But you would
have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against me. It is
your fault that I have made nothing of my life.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have
you not been happy here?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has
never really been so.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Not?not happy!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But
our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife,
just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been
my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they
thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage
has been, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. There is some truth in what you say?exaggerated and
strained as your view of it is. But for the future it shall be
different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 108]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Whose lessons? Mine, or the children's?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Both yours and the children's, my darling Nora.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being
a proper wife for you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And you can say that!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. And I?how am I fitted to bring up the children?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Didn't you say so yourself a little while ago?that you
dare not trust me to bring them up?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the
task. There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and
educate myself?you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that
for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>springing up</i>). What do you say?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and
everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you
any longer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora, Nora!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine
will take me in for the night?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 109]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You are out of your mind! I won't allow it! I forbid you!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take
with me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now
or later.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What sort of madness is this!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Tomorrow I shall go home?I mean to my old home. It will be
easiest for me to find something to do there.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You blind, foolish woman!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I must try and get some sense, Torvald.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And
you don't consider what people will say!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is
necessary for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. It's shocking. This is how you would neglect your most
sacred duties.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What do you consider my most sacred duties?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Do I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to
your husband and your children?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I have other duties just as sacred.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That you have not. What duties could those be?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Duties to myself.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Before all else, you are a wife and mother.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 110]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all
else I am a reasonable human being, just as you are?or, at all events,
that I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most
people would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be
found in books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people
say, or with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself
and get to understand them.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have
you not a reliable guide in such matters as that??have you no religion?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. What are you saying?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to
be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the
other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that
matter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all
events if it is true for me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion
cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose
you have some moral sense? Or?answer me?am I to think you have none?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to
answer. I really don't know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only
know that you and I look at it in quite a different

<span class="pagenum">[pg 111]</span>

light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what
I supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is
right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying
father, or to save her husband's life. I can't believe that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You talk like a child. You don't understand the
conditions of the world in which you live.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see
if I can make out who is right, the world or I.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you
are out of your mind.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as to-night.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake
your husband and your children?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, it is.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Then there is only one possible explanation.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. What is that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. You do not love me any more.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No, that is just it.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora!?and you can say that?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been
so kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>regaining his composure</i>). Is that a clear and
certain conviction too?
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 112]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I
will not stay here any longer.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Yes, indeed I can. It was to-night, when the wonderful
thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Explain yourself better?I don't understand you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness
knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day.
Then this horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite
certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When
Krogstad's letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine
that you would consent to accept this man's conditions. I was so
absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the
whole world. And when that was done?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Yes, what then??when I had exposed my wife to shame and
disgrace?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would
come forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty
one.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora?!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice
on your part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been
worth against yours? That was the

<span class="pagenum">[pg 113]</span>

wonderful thing which I hoped for and feared; and it was to prevent
that, that I wanted to kill myself.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora?bear
sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for
the one he loves.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could
bind myself to. As soon as your fear was over?and it was not fear for
what threatened me, but for what might happen to you?when the whole
thing was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if
nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little
skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle
care, because it was so brittle and fragile. (<i>Getting up</i>.)
Torvald?it was then it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been
living here with a strange man, and had borne him three children?. Oh!
I can't bear to think of it! I could tear myself into little bits!
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>sadly</i>). I see, I see. An abyss has opened between
us?there is no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill
it up?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. As I am now, I am no wife for you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. I have it in me to become a different man.
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 114]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Perhaps?if your doll is taken away from you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But to part!?to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can't
understand that idea.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>going out to the right</i>). That makes it all the more
certain that it must be done. (<i>She comes back with her cloak and hat
and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora, Nora, not now! Wait till tomorrow.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>putting on her cloak</i>). I cannot spend the night in a
strange man's room.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But can't we live here like brother and sister??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>putting on her hat</i>). You know very well that would
not last long. (<i>Puts the shawl round her</i>.) Good-bye, Torvald. I
won't see the little ones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As
I am now, I can be of no use to them.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But some day, Nora?some day?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. How can I tell? I have no idea what is going to become of me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But you are my wife, whatever becomes of you.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her
husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all
obligations towards her. In any case I set you free from all your
obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way,
any

<span class="pagenum">[pg 115]</span>

more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See,
here is your ring back. Give me mine.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. That too?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That too.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Here it is.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That's right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here.
The maids know all about everything in the house?better than I do.
Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up my
own things that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after
me.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. All over! All over!?Nora, shall you never think of me again?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. I know I shall often think of you and the children and this house.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. May I write to you, Nora?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No?never. You must not do that.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But at least let me send you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Nothing?nothing?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Let me help you if you are in want.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. No. I can receive nothing from a stranger.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Nora?can I never be anything more than a stranger to you?
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i> (<i>taking her bag</i>). Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful
thing of all would have to happen.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. Tell me what that would be!
</p><br>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 116]</span>
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. Both you and I would have to be so changed that?. Oh,
Torvald, I don't believe any longer in wonderful things happening.
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i>. But I will believe in it. Tell me? So changed that??
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Nora</i>. That our life together would be a real wedlock. Good-bye.
(<i>She goes out through the hall</i>.)
</p><br>
<p>
<i>Helmer</i> (<i>sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face
in his hands</i>). Nora! Nora! (<i>Looks round, and rises</i>.) Empty.
She is gone. (<i>A hope flashes across his mind</i>.) The most wonderful
thing of all??
</p><br>
<p class="hang">
(<i>The sound of a door shutting is heard from below</i>.)

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit:

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date. If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.
