viz. ?That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the 
flesh,? was never more verified than in the story of my 
Life.&nbsp; Any one would think that after thirty-five 
years? affliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances, 
which few men, if any, ever went through before, and after near 
seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things; 
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have had 
experience of every state of middle life, and to know which was 
most adapted to make a man completely happy; I say, after all 
this, any one would have thought that the native propensity to 
rambling which I gave an account of in my first setting out in 
the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts, should be 
worn out, and I might, at sixty one years of age, have been a 
little inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing life and
fortune any more.</p><br>
<p>Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was 
taken away in me, for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to 
seek: if I had gained ten thousand pounds I had been no richer; 
for I had already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave
it to; and what I had was visibly increasing; for, having no 
great family, I could not spend the income of what I had unless I
would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a great 
family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were 
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had 
nothing, indeed, to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I 
had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands.&nbsp; Yet all 
these things had no effect upon me, or at least not enough to 
resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which 
hung about me like a chronic distemper.&nbsp; In particular, the 
desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the colony 
I left there, ran in my head continually.&nbsp; I dreamed of it 
all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day: it was 
uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, 
nothing could remove it out of my mind: it even broke so 
violently into all my discourses that it made my conversation 
tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else; all my discourse ran 
into it, even to impertinence; and I saw it myself.</p><br>
<p>I have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the 
stir that people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions 
is owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful 
operation of fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as
a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking; that people?s 
poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their 
deceased friends so realises it to them that they are capable of 
fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see 
them, talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, 
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, and they 
really know nothing of the matter.</p><br>
<p>For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any 
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people 
after they are dead; or whether there is anything in the stories 
they tell us of that kind more than the product of vapours, sick 
minds, and wandering fancies: but this I know, that my 
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought me into such 
excess of vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually 
supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old castle, behind the
trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday?s father, and the 
reprobate sailors I left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked
with them, and looked at them steadily, though I was broad awake,
as at persons just before me; and this I did till I often 
frightened myself with the images my fancy represented to 
me.&nbsp; One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of the three 
pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard, and
Friday?s father, that it was surprising: they told me how 
they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that 
they set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to 
distress and starve them; things that I had never heard of, and 
that, indeed, were never all of them true in fact: but it was so 
warm in my imagination, and so realised to me, that, to the hour 
I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was or would be 
true; also how I resented it, when the Spaniard complained to me;
and how I brought them to justice, tried them, and ordered them 
all three to be hanged.&nbsp; What there was really in this shall
be seen in its place; for however I came to form such things in 
my dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet 
there was, I say, much of it true.&nbsp; I own that this dream 
had nothing in it literally and specifically true; but the 
general part was so true?the base; villainous behaviour of 
these three hardened rogues was such, and had been so much worse 
than all I can describe, that the dream had too much similitude 
of the fact; and as I would afterwards have punished them 
severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had been much in the 
right, and even should have been justified both by the laws of 
God and man.</p><br>
<p>But to return to my story.&nbsp; In this kind of temper I 
lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant 
hours, no agreeable diversion but what had something or other of 
this in it; so that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it,
told me very seriously one night that she believed there was some
secret, powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had 
determined me to go thither again; and that she found nothing 
hindered me going but my being engaged to a wife and 
children.&nbsp; She told me that it was true she could not think 
of parting with me: but as she was assured that if she was dead 
it would be the first thing I would do, so, as it seemed to her 
that the thing was determined above, she would not be the only 
obstruction; for, if I thought fit and resolved to go?[Here
she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very 
earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her, and she 
stopped.&nbsp; I asked her why she did not go on, and say out 
what she was going to say?&nbsp; But I perceived that her heart 
was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes.]&nbsp; 
?Speak out, my dear,? said I; ?are you willing 
I should go????No,? says she, very 
affectionately, ?I am far from willing; but if you are 
resolved to go,? says she, ?rather than I would be 
the only hindrance, I will go with you: for though I think it a 
most preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your 
condition, yet, if it must be,? said she, again weeping, 
?I would not leave you; for if it be of Heaven you must do 
it, there is no resisting it; and if Heaven make it your duty to 
go, He will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise 
dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it.?</p><br>
<p>This affectionate behaviour of my wife?s brought me a 
little out of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was 
doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with 
myself sedately what business I had after threescore years, and 
after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed
in so happy and easy a manner; I, say, what business had I to 
rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only 
for youth and poverty to run into?</p><br>
<p>With those thoughts I considered my new engagement; that I had
a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of 
another; that I had all the world could give me, and had no need 
to seek hazard for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought
to think rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking to 
increase it; that as to what my wife had said of its being an 
impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had 
no notion of that; so, after many of these cogitations, I 
struggled with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself out 
of it, as I believe people may always do in like cases if they 
will: in a word, I conquered it, composed myself with such 
arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my present 
condition furnished me plentifully with; and particularly, as the
most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with other 
things, and to engage in some business that might effectually tie
me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I found that 
thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to 
do, nor anything of moment immediately before me.&nbsp; To this 
purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, and 
resolved to remove myself thither.&nbsp; I had a little 
convenient house upon it, and the land about it, I found, was 
capable of great improvement; and it was many ways suited to my 
inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, 
and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland country,
I was removed from conversing among sailors and things relating 
to the remote parts of the world.&nbsp; I went down to my farm, 
settled my family, bought ploughs, harrows, a cart, 
waggon-horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously to work, 
became in one half-year a mere country gentleman.&nbsp; My 
thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants, 
cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, &amp;c.; and I 
lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature was 
capable of directing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes 
was capable of retreating to.</p><br>
<p>I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited 
by no articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what I 
planted was for myself, and what I improved was for my family; 
and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the
least discomfort in any part of life as to this world.&nbsp; Now 
I thought, indeed, that I enjoyed the middle state of life which 
my father so earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of 
heavenly life, something like what is described by the poet, upon
the subject of a country life:?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>?Free from vices, free from care,<br>
Age has no pain, and youth no snare.?</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen 
Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon 
me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, 
into a deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as I may
say, being born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me; 
and, like the returns of a violent distemper, came on with an 
irresistible force upon me.&nbsp; This blow was the loss of my 
wife.&nbsp; It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my 
wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and make my 
court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon.&nbsp; She 
was, in a few words, the stay of all my affairs; the centre of 
all my enterprises; the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me 
to that happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant and 
ruinous project that filled my head, and did more to guide my 
rambling genius than a mother?s tears, a father?s 
instructions, a friend?s counsel, or all my own reasoning 
powers could do.&nbsp; I was happy in listening to her, and in 
being moved by her entreaties; and to the last degree desolate 
and dislocated in the world by the loss of her.</p><br>
<p>When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me.&nbsp; 
I was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the 
Brazils, when I first went on shore there; and as much alone, 
except for the assistance of servants, as I was in my 
island.&nbsp; I knew neither what to think nor what to do.&nbsp; 
I saw the world busy around me: one part labouring for bread, 
another part squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures, but
equally miserable because the end they proposed still fled from 
them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, 
and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of 
labour spent their strength in daily struggling for bread to 
maintain the vital strength they laboured with: so living in a 
daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and working but 
to live, as if daily bread were the only end of wearisome life, 
and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread.</p><br>
<p>This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the 
island; where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not 
want it; and bred no more goats, because I had no more use for 
them; where the money lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and 
had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty years.&nbsp; 
All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have done, 
and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught 
me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity; 
and that there was something which certainly was the reason and 
end of life superior to all these things, and which was either to
be possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side of the 
grave.</p><br>
<p>But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without a 
pilot, that could only run afore the wind.&nbsp; My thoughts ran 
all away again into the old affair; my head was quite turned with
the whimsies of foreign adventures; and all the pleasant, 
innocent amusements of my farm, my garden, my cattle, and my 
family, which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, 
had no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or 
food to one that has no taste.&nbsp; In a word, I resolved to 
leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London; and in
a few months after I did so.</p><br>
<p>When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; 
I had no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do
but to saunter about like an idle person, of whom it may be said 
he is perfectly useless in God?s creation, and it is not 
one farthing?s matter to the rest of his kind whether he be
dead or alive.&nbsp; This also was the thing which, of all 
circumstances of life, was the most my aversion, who had been all
my days used to an active life; and I would often say to myself, 
?A state of idleness is the very dregs of life;? and,
indeed, I thought I was much more suitably employed when I was 
twenty-six days making a deal board.</p><br>
<p>It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, 
whom, as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and
had made him commander of a ship, was come home from a short 
voyage to Bilbao, being the first he had made.&nbsp; He came to 
me, and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had been 
proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and 
to China, as private traders.&nbsp; ?And now, uncle,?
says he, ?if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to 
land you upon your old habitation in the island; for we are to 
touch at the Brazils.?</p><br>
<p>Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and 
of the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of 
second causes with the idea of things which we form in our minds,
perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the world.</p><br>
<p>My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was 
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his 
thought to say, when that very morning, before he came to me, I 
had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every
part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, 
that I would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-captain; 
and if it was rational and practicable, I would go and see the 
island again, and what was become of my people there.&nbsp; I had
pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the place, and 
carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a patent for the 
possession and I know not what; when, in the middle of all this, 
in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project of carrying 
me thither in his way to the East Indies.</p><br>
<p>I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him, 
?What devil,? said I, ?sent you on this unlucky
errand??&nbsp; My nephew stared as if he had been 
frightened at first; but perceiving that I was not much 
displeased at the proposal, he recovered himself.&nbsp; ?I 
hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir,? says 
he.&nbsp; ?I daresay you would be pleased to see your new 
colony there, where you once reigned with more felicity than most
of your brother monarchs in the world.?&nbsp; In a word, 
the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to say, the 
prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so much, that
I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I 
would go with him; but I told him I would not promise to go any 
further than my own island.&nbsp; ?Why, sir,? says 
he, ?you don?t want to be left there again, I 
hope??&nbsp; ?But,? said I, ?can you not 
take me up again on your return??&nbsp; He told me it would
not be possible to do so; that the merchants would never allow 
him to come that way with a laden ship of such value, it being a 
month?s sail out of his way, and might be three or 
four.&nbsp; ?Besides, sir, if I should miscarry,? 
said he, ?and not return at all, then you would be just 
reduced to the condition you were in before.?</p><br>
<p>This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it,
which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being
taken in pieces, might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we 
agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island, and 
finished fit to go to sea in a few days.&nbsp; I was not long 
resolving, for indeed the importunities of my nephew joined so 
effectually with my inclination that nothing could oppose me; on 
the other hand, my wife being dead, none concerned themselves so 
much for me as to persuade me one way or the other, except my 
ancient good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to
consider my years, my easy circumstances, and the needless 
hazards of a long voyage; and above all, my young children.&nbsp;
But it was all to no purpose, I had an irresistible desire for 
the voyage; and I told her I thought there was something so 
uncommon in the impressions I had upon my mind, that it would be 
a kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at 
home; after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with 
me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in 
settling my family affairs for my absence, and providing for the 
education of my children.&nbsp; In order to do this, I made my 
will, and settled the estate I had in such a manner for my 
children, and placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever might 
befall me; and for their education, I left it wholly to the 
widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care: all
which she richly deserved; for no mother could have taken more 
care in their education, or understood it better; and as she 
lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.</p><br>
<p>My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January 
1694-5; and I, with my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, 
the 8th; having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a 
very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my 
colony, which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to
leave so.</p><br>
<p>First, I carried with me some servants whom I purposed to 
place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon
my account while I stayed, and either to leave them there or 
carry them forward, as they should appear willing; particularly, 
I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious 
fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general 
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to
grind corn, was a good turner and a good pot-maker; he also made 
anything that was proper to make of earth or of wood: in a word, 
we called him our Jack-of-all-trades.&nbsp; With these I carried 
a tailor, who had offered himself to go a passenger to the East 
Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our 
new plantation, and who proved a most necessary handy fellow as 
could be desired in many other businesses besides that of his 
trade; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all 
employments.</p><br>
<p>My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept 
account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards 
that I expected to find there; and enough of them, as by my 
calculation might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I 
remember right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with 
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to about two hundred pounds, including
some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen 
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &amp;c.; and near a 
hundred pounds more in ironwork, nails, tools of every kind, 
staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could think 
of.</p><br>
<p>I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees; 
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all 
sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass 
cannon; and, because I knew not what time and what extremities I 
was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides
swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and 
halberds.&nbsp; In short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of
store; and I made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns 
more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there was 
occasion; so that when we came there we might build a fort and 
man it against all sorts of enemies.&nbsp; Indeed, I at first 
thought there would be need enough for all, and much more, if we 
hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as shall be seen 
in the course of that story.</p><br>
<p>I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to 
meet with, and therefore shall have the less occasion to 
interrupt the reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how 
matters went with my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds 
and bad weather happened on this first setting out, which made 
the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and I, who had 
never made but one voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in which I 
might be said to come back again, as the voyage was at first 
designed, began to think the same ill fate attended me, and that 
I was born to be never contented with being on shore, and yet to 
be always unfortunate at sea.&nbsp; Contrary winds first put us 
to the northward, and we were obliged to put in at Galway, in 
Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two-and-twenty days; but we had 
this satisfaction with the disaster, that provisions were here 
exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that while we lay 
here we never touched the ship?s stores, but rather added 
to them.&nbsp; Here, also, I took in several live hogs, and two 
cows with their calves, which I resolved, if I had a good 
passage, to put on shore in my island; but we found occasion to 
dispose otherwise of them.</p><br>
<p>We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very
fair gale of wind for some days.&nbsp; As I remember, it might be
about the 20th of February in the evening late, when the mate, 
having the watch, came into the round-house and told us he saw a 
flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us
of it, a boy came in and told us the boatswain heard 
another.&nbsp; This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, 
where for a while we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a
very great light, and found that there was some very terrible 
fire at a distance; immediately we had recourse to our 
reckonings, in which we all agreed that there could be no land 
that way in which the fire showed itself, no, not for five 
hundred leagues, for it appeared at WNW.&nbsp; Upon this, we 
concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our 
hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could
not be far off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently 
satisfied we should discover it, because the further we sailed, 
the greater the light appeared; though, the weather being hazy, 
we could not perceive anything but the light for a while.&nbsp; 
In about half-an-hour?s sailing, the wind being fair for 
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, 
we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the 
middle of the sea.</p><br>
<p>I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at 
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently 
recollected my former circumstances, and what condition I was in 
when taken up by the Portuguese captain; and how much more 
deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to 
that ship must be, if they had no other ship in company with 
them.&nbsp; Upon this I immediately ordered that five guns should
be fired, one soon after another, that, if possible, we might 
give notice to them that there was help for them at hand and that
they might endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for though
we could see the flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, 
could see nothing of us.</p><br>
<p>We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning 
ship drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great
terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in 
the air; and in a few minutes all the fire was out, that is to 
say, the rest of the ship sunk.&nbsp; This was a terrible, and 
indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I 
concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the
utmost distress in their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which,
at present, as it was dark, I could not see.&nbsp; However, to 
direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in
all parts of the ship where we could, and which we had lanterns 
for, and kept firing guns all the night long, letting them know 
by this that there was a ship not far off.</p><br>
<p>About eight o?clock in the morning we discovered the 
ship?s boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and 
found there were two of them, both thronged with people, and deep
in the water.&nbsp; We perceived they rowed, the wind being 
against them; that they saw our ship, and did their utmost to 
make us see them.&nbsp; We immediately spread our ancient, to let
them know we saw them, and hung a waft out, as a signal for them 
to come on board, and then made more sail, standing directly to 
them.&nbsp; In little more than half-an-hour we came up with 
them; and took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, 
women, and children; for there were a great many passengers.</p><br>
<p>Upon inquiry we found it was a French merchant ship of 
three-hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec.&nbsp; The master gave
us a long account of the distress of his ship; how the fire began
in the steerage by the negligence of the steersman, which, on his
crying out for help, was, as everybody thought, entirely put out;
but they soon found that some sparks of the first fire had got 
into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they 
could not effectually quench it; and afterwards getting in 
between the timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it 
proceeded into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the 
application they were able to exert.</p><br>
<p>They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, 
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their 
long-boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was 
of no great service to them, other than to get some fresh water 
and provisions into her, after they had secured their lives from 
the fire.&nbsp; They had, indeed, small hopes of their lives by 
getting into these boats at that distance from any land; only, as
they said, that they thus escaped from the fire, and there was a 
possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might 
take them in.&nbsp; They had sails, oars, and a compass; and had 
as much provision and water as, with sparing it so as to be next 
door to starving, might support them about twelve days, in which,
if they had no bad weather and no contrary winds, the captain 
said he hoped he might get to the banks of Newfoundland, and 
might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they might go 
on shore.&nbsp; But there were so many chances against them in 
all these cases, such as storms, to overset and founder them; 
rains and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs; contrary winds,
to keep them out and starve them; that it must have been next to 
miraculous if they had escaped.</p><br>
<p>In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless 
and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told 
me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun 
fire, and after that four more: these were the five guns which I 
caused to be fired at first seeing the light.&nbsp; This revived 
their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, I 
desired it should, that there was a ship at hand for their 
help.&nbsp; It was upon the hearing of these guns that they took 
down their masts and sails: the sound coming from the windward, 
they resolved to lie by till morning.&nbsp; Some time after this,
hearing no more guns, they fired three muskets, one a 
considerable while after another; but these, the wind being 
contrary, we never heard.&nbsp; Some time after that again they 
were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and 
hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be fired all
the rest of the night.&nbsp; This set them to work with their 
oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least that we might the 
sooner come up with them; and at last, to their inexpressible 
joy, they found we saw them.</p><br>
<p>It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the 
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures which these poor 
delivered people ran into, to express the joy of their souls at 
so unexpected a deliverance.&nbsp; Grief and fear are easily 
described: sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the 
head and hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of 
joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it.&nbsp;
There were some in tears; some raging and tearing themselves, as 
if they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark 
raving and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping 
with their feet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing, 
some singing, some laughing, more crying, many quite dumb, not 
able to speak a word; others sick and vomiting; several swooning 
and ready to faint; and a few were crossing themselves and giving
God thanks.</p><br>
<p>I would not wrong them either; there might be many that were 
thankful afterwards; but the passion was too strong for them at 
first, and they were not able to master it: then were thrown into
ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very few that 
were composed and serious in their joy.&nbsp; Perhaps also, the 
case may have some addition to it from the particular 
circumstance of that nation they belonged to: I mean the French, 
whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid than in other 
nations.&nbsp; I am not philosopher enough to determine the 
cause; but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it.&nbsp; 
The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in when he found
his father in the boat came the nearest to it; and the surprise 
of the master and his two companions, whom I delivered from the 
villains that set them on shore in the island, came a little way 
towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw
in Friday, or anywhere else in my life.</p><br>
<p>It is further observable, that these extravagances did not 
show themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in 
different persons only; but all the variety would appear, in a 
short succession of moments, in one and the same person.&nbsp; A 
man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and 
confounded, would the next minute be dancing and hallooing like 
an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his
clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a 
madman; in a few moments after that we would have him all in 
tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not immediate help been had,
he would in a few moments have been dead.&nbsp; Thus it was, not 
with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of 
them; and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged to let 
blood of about thirty persons.</p><br>
<p>There were two priests among them: one an old man, and the 
other a young man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest 
man was the worst.&nbsp; As soon as he set his foot on board our 
ship, and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead to all 
appearance.&nbsp; Not the least sign of life could be perceived 
in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to 
recover him, and was the only man in the ship that believed he 
was not dead.&nbsp; At length he opened a vein in his arm, having
first chafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as 
possible.&nbsp; Upon this the blood, which only dropped at first,
flowing freely, in three minutes after the man opened his eyes; a
quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew better, and after 
the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly 
well, and took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave 
him.&nbsp; About a quarter of an hour after this they came 
running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a 
Frenchwoman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone 
stark mad.&nbsp; It seems he had begun to revolve the change of 
his circumstances in his mind, and again this put him into an 
ecstasy of joy.&nbsp; His spirits whirled about faster than the 
vessels could convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish, and 
the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in 
it.&nbsp; The surgeon would not bleed him again in that 
condition, but gave him something to doze and put him to sleep; 
which, after some time, operated upon him, and he awoke next 
morning perfectly composed and well.&nbsp; The younger priest 
behaved with great command of his passions, and was really an 
example of a serious, well-governed mind.&nbsp; At his first 
coming on board the ship he threw himself flat on his face, 
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which
I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he 
had been in a swoon; but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he 
was giving God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave him
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me 
thanks also.&nbsp; I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and
not only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
also.&nbsp; He continued in that posture about three minutes, or 
little more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had said he
would, and with a great deal of seriousness and affection, but 
with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given 
him and so many miserable creatures their lives.&nbsp; I told him
I had no need to tell him to thank God for it, rather than me, 
for I had seen that he had done that already; but I added that it
was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men, and
that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had 
blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of His mercy to 
so many of His creatures.&nbsp; After this the young priest 
applied himself to his countrymen, and laboured to compose them: 
he persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his 
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason; and with
some he had success, though others were for a time out of all 
government of themselves.</p><br>
<p>I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be
useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding 
themselves in the extravagances of their passions; for if an 
excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach
of their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, 
and a provoked mind carry us to?&nbsp; And, indeed, here I saw 
reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every 
kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow 
and anger.</p><br>
<p>We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among our 
new guests for the first day; but after they had retired to 
lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and 
had slept heartily?as most of them did, being fatigued and 
frightened?they were quite another sort of people the next 
day.&nbsp; Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for 
the kindness shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, 
are naturally apt enough to exceed that way.&nbsp; The captain 
and one of the priests came to me the next day, and desired to 
speak with me and my nephew; the commander began to consult with 
us what should be done with them; and first, they told us we had 
saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a return
to us for that kindness received.&nbsp; The captain said they had
saved some money and some things of value in their boats, caught 
hastily out of the flames, and if we would accept it they were 
ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only desired to be
set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might
get a passage to France.&nbsp; My nephew wished to accept their 
money at first word, and to consider what to do with them 
afterwards; but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what it 
was to be set on shore in a strange country; and if the 
Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served me so, and 
taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have been starved, or 
have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at 
Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and perhaps
a Portuguese is not a much better master than a Turk, if not in 
some cases much worse.</p><br>
<p>I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up 
in their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do 
so, as we were fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be so 
delivered if we were in the like or any other extremity; that we 
had done nothing for them but what we believed they would have 
done for us if we had been in their case and they in ours; but 
that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it 
would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from them 
which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore 
and leave them; that this would be first to save them from death,
and then kill them ourselves: save them from drowning, and 
abandon them to starving; and therefore I would not let the least
thing be taken from them.&nbsp; As to setting them on shore, I 
told them indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that
the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though we were driven 
out of our course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps 
were directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it 
was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on their 
particular account; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it 
to the freighters, with whom he was under charter to pursue his 
voyage by way of Brazil; and all I knew we could do for them was 
to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward 
bound from the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, 
to England or France.</p><br>
<p>The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they 
could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in very 
great consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of 
being carried away to the East Indies; they then entreated me 
that as I was driven so far to the westward before I met with 
them, I would at least keep on the same course to the banks of 
Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some ship 
or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada.</p><br>
<p>I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and
therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered that
to carry this whole company to the East Indies would not only be 
an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be 
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I 
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen 
accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one 
could say we were to blame; for the laws of God and nature would 
have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of 
people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of the 
thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged 
us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their 
deliverance.&nbsp; So I consented that we would carry them to 
Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit: and if not, I 
would carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies.</p><br>
<p>The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty 
good; and as the winds had continued in the points between NE. 
and SE. a long time, we missed several opportunities of sending 
them to France; for we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof
two were French, from St. Christopher?s, but they had been 
so long beating up against the wind that they durst take in no 
passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as 
well for themselves as for those they should take in; so we were 
obliged to go on.&nbsp; It was about a week after this that we 
made the banks of Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story, we 
put all our French people on board a bark, which they hired at 
sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to 
France, if they could get provisions to victual themselves 
with.&nbsp; When I say all the French went on shore, I should 
remember that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound 
to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be 
set on shore on the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed 
to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as
will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered 
themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.</p><br>
<p>From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, 
steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, 
sometimes little or no wind at all; when we met with another 
subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as 
that before.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER II?INTERVENING HISTORY OF COLONY</h2>
<p>It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., on the 19th
day of March 1694-95, when we spied a sail, our course SE. and by
S.&nbsp; We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she 
bore up to us, but could not at first know what to make of her, 
till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her 
main-topmast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fired a 
gun as a signal of distress.&nbsp; The weather was pretty good, 
wind at NNW. a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with 
her.&nbsp; We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from 
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few 
days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while
the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that, 
besides the terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent case
for good mariners to bring the ship home.&nbsp; They had been 
already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible 
storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite 
out of their knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost 
their masts.&nbsp; They told us they expected to have seen the 
Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the 
south-east, by a strong gale of wind at NNW., the same that blew 
now: and having no sails to work the ship with but a main course,
and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had 
set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring 
to stand away for the Canaries.</p><br>
<p>But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost 
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had 
undergone; their bread and flesh were quite gone?they had 
not one ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven 
days.&nbsp; The only relief they had was, their water was not all
spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour left; they had 
sugar enough; some succades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, 
but these were all devoured; and they had seven casks of 
rum.&nbsp; There was a youth and his mother and a maid-servant on
board, who were passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to 
sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the hurricane 
began; and having no provisions of their own left, they were in a
more deplorable condition than the rest: for the seamen being 
reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no 
compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and they 
were, indeed, in such a condition that their misery is very hard 
to describe.</p><br>
<p>I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led
me, the weather being fair and the wind abated, to go on board 
the ship.&nbsp; The second mate, who upon this occasion commanded
the ship, had been on board our ship, and he told me they had 
three passengers in the great cabin that were in a deplorable 
condition.&nbsp; ?Nay,? says he, ?I believe 
they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two 
days; and I was afraid to inquire after them,? said he, 
?for I had nothing to relieve them with.?&nbsp; We 
immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could 
spare; and indeed I had so far overruled things with my nephew, 
that I would have victualled them though we had gone away to 
Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America, to have 
supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.</p><br>
<p>But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of 
eating too much, even of that little we gave them.&nbsp; The 
mate, or commander, brought six men with him in his boat; but 
these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak that 
they could hardly sit to their oars.&nbsp; The mate himself was 
very ill, and half starved; for he declared he had reserved 
nothing from the men, and went share and share alike with them in
every bit they ate.&nbsp; I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and 
set meat before him immediately, but he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of order; so he 
stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed him up something with some
broth, which he said would be to him both food and physic; and 
after he had taken it he grew better.&nbsp; In the meantime I 
forgot not the men.&nbsp; I ordered victuals to be given them, 
and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it: they were so 
exceedingly hungry that they were in a manner ravenous, and had 
no command of themselves; and two of them ate with so much 
greediness that they were in danger of their lives the next 
morning.&nbsp; The sight of these people?s distress was 
very moving to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible 
prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island, where I had
not the least mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any;
besides the hourly apprehensions I had of being made the food of 
other creatures.&nbsp; But all the while the mate was thus 
relating to me the miserable condition of the ship?s 
company, I could not put out of my thought the story he had told 
me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the 
mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing 
of for two or three days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they 
had wholly neglected, their own extremities being so great; by 
which I understood that they had really given them no food at 
all, and that therefore they must be perished, and be all lying 
dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin.</p><br>
<p>As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on 
board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the 
starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat to
go on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to carry 
them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to 
boil.&nbsp; Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be 
boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to 
prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very 
little at a time: and by this caution he preserved the men, who 
would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that 
was given them on purpose to save their lives.</p><br>
<p>At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great 
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in; and if
they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what refreshment 
was proper: and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some 
of the prepared broth which he had given the mate that was on 
board, and which he did not question would restore them 
gradually.&nbsp; I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said 
above, having a great mind to see the scene of misery which I 
knew the ship itself would present me with, in a more lively 
manner than I could have it by report, I took the captain of the 
ship, as we now called him, with me, and went myself, a little 
after, in their boat.</p><br>
<p>I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the 
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate 
observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door,
and the man he placed there, after using all possible persuasion 
to have patience, kept them off by force; however, he caused some
biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the 
liquor of the meat, which they called brewis, and gave them every
one some to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their 
own safety that he was obliged to give them but little at a 
time.&nbsp; But it was all in vain; and had I not come on board, 
and their own commander and officers with me, and with good 
words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe 
they would have broken into the cook-room by force, and torn the 
meat out of the furnace?for words are indeed of very small 
force to a hungry belly; however, we pacified them, and fed them 
gradually and cautiously at first, and the next time gave them 
more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well 
enough.</p><br>
<p>But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of 
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the 
ship?s company had so little for themselves, it was but too
true that they had at first kept them very low, and at last 
totally neglected them: so that for six or seven days it might be
said they had really no food at all, and for several days before 
very little.&nbsp; The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was
a woman of sense and good breeding, had spared all she could so 
affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sank under 
it; and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor
on deck, with her back up against the sides, between two chairs, 
which were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoulders 
like a corpse, though not quite dead.&nbsp; My mate said all he 
could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put some 
broth into her mouth.&nbsp; She opened her lips, and lifted up 
one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood what he said, 
and made signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for her, 
but pointed to her child, as if she would have said they should 
take care of him.&nbsp; However, the mate, who was exceedingly 
moved at the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her
mouth, and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls 
down?though I question whether he could be sure of it or 
not; but it was too late, and she died the same night.</p><br>
<p>The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most 
affectionate mother?s life, was not so far gone; yet he lay
in a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life left 
in him.&nbsp; He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having
eaten up the rest of it; however, being young, and having more 
strength than his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive; though by giving him, some time 
after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very 
sick, and brought it up again.</p><br>
<p>But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon 
the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen
down in a fit of apoplexy, and struggled for life.&nbsp; Her 
limbs were distorted; one of her hands was clasped round the 
frame of the chair, and she gripped it so hard that we could not 
easily make her let it go; her other arm lay over her head, and 
her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the 
cabin table: in short, she lay just like one in the agonies of 
death, and yet she was alive too.&nbsp; The poor creature was not
only starved with hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of 
death, but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for
her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days before, 
and whom she loved most tenderly.&nbsp; We knew not what to do 
with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who was a man of very 
great knowledge and experience, had, with great application, 
recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hands still; for 
she was little less than distracted for a considerable time 
after.</p><br>
<p>Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to 
consider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the 
country, where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a 
place.&nbsp; Our business was to relieve this distressed 
ship?s crew, but not lie by for them; and though they were 
willing to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we 
could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no 
masts.&nbsp; However, as their captain begged of us to help him 
to set up a main-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to his jury 
fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four days;
and then, having given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of 
pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, 
and what other things we could spare; and taking three casks of 
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight from them for 
satisfaction, we left them, taking on board with us, at their own
earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.</p><br>
<p>The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty, 
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the 
loss of his mother, and also at having lost his father but a few 
months before, at Barbadoes.&nbsp; He begged of the surgeon to 
speak to me to take him out of the ship; for he said the cruel 
fellows had murdered his mother: and indeed so they had, that is 
to say, passively; for they might have spared a small sustenance 
to the poor helpless widow, though it had been but just enough to
keep her alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no 
justice, no right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable of 
no compassion.</p><br>
<p>The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would 
carry him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as 
bad circumstances almost as those we found him in, that is to 
say, starving in the world.&nbsp; He said it mattered not whither
he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he 
was among; that the captain (by which he meant me, for he could 
know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure 
would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came
to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry them 
where we would.&nbsp; The surgeon represented the case so 
affectionately to me that I yielded, and we took them both on 
board, with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, 
which could not be removed or come at; and as the youth had a 
bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign a writing, 
obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr.
Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was related, 
and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods 
he had belonging to the deceased widow; which, I suppose, was not
done, for I could never learn that the ship came to Bristol, but 
was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so disabled a 
condition, and so far from any land, that I am of opinion the 
first storm she met with afterwards she might founder, for she 
was leaky, and had damage in her hold when we met with her.</p><br>
<p>I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, and had 
hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the 
winds had been contrary.&nbsp; I shall trouble nobody with the 
little incidents of wind, weather, currents, &amp;c., on the rest
of our voyage; but to shorten my story, shall observe that I came
to my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April 
1695.&nbsp; It was with no small difficulty that I found the 
place; for as I came to it and went to it before on the south and
east side of the island, coming from the Brazils, so now, coming 
in between the main and the island, and having no chart for the 
coast, nor any landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or, 
know whether I saw it or not.&nbsp; We beat about a great while, 
and went on shore on several islands in the mouth of the great 
river Orinoco, but none for my purpose; only this I learned by my
coasting the shore, that I was under one great mistake before, 
viz. that the continent which I thought I saw from the island I 
lived in was really no continent, but a long island, or rather a 
ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side of the 
extended mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came
to my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees, but
islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited 
nearer to our side than the rest.</p><br>
<p>In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose; 
some I found were inhabited, and some were not; on one of them I 
found some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there; but 
speaking with them, found they had a sloop lying in a small creek
hard by, and came thither to make salt, and to catch some 
pearl-mussels if they could; but that they belonged to the Isle 
de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in the latitude of 10 and 
11 degrees.</p><br>
<p>Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the 
ship, sometimes with the Frenchman?s shallop, which we had 
found a convenient boat, and therefore kept her with their very 
good will, at length I came fair on the south side of my island, 
and presently knew the very countenance of the place: so I 
brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with the little 
creek where my old habitation was.&nbsp; As soon as I saw the 
place I called for Friday, and asked him if he knew where he 
was?&nbsp; He looked about a little, and presently clapping his 
hands, cried, ?Oh yes, Oh there, Oh yes, Oh there!? 
pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and capering 
like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping 
into the sea to swim ashore to the place.</p><br>
<p>?Well, Friday,? says I, ?do you think we 
shall find anybody here or no? and do you think we shall see your
father??&nbsp; The fellow stood mute as a stock a good 
while; but when I named his father, the poor affectionate 
creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his 
face very plentifully.&nbsp; ?What is the matter, Friday? 
are you troubled because you may see your father??&nbsp; 
?No, no,? says he, shaking his head, ?no see 
him more: no, never more see him again.?&nbsp; ?Why 
so, Friday? how do you know that??&nbsp; ?Oh no, Oh 
no,? says Friday, ?he long ago die, long ago; he much
old man.?&nbsp; ?Well, well, Friday, you don?t 
know; but shall we see any one else, then??&nbsp; The 
fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points to the 
hill just above my old house; and though we lay half a league 
off, he cries out, ?We see! we see! yes, we see much man 
there, and there, and there.?&nbsp; I looked, but I saw 
nobody, no, not with a perspective glass, which was, I suppose, 
because I could not hit the place: for the fellow was right, as I
found upon inquiry the next day; and there were five or six men 
all together, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to 
think of us.</p><br>
<p>As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English 
ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice 
we were friends; and in about a quarter of an hour after we 
perceived a smoke arise from the side of the creek; so I 
immediately ordered the boat out, taking Friday with me, and 
hanging out a white flag, I went directly on shore, taking with 
me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the story of 
my living there, and the manner of it, and every particular both 
of myself and those I left there, and who was on that account 
extremely desirous to go with me.&nbsp; We had, besides, about 
sixteen men well armed, if we had found any new guests there 
which we did not know of; but we had no need of weapons.</p><br>
<p>As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, 
we rowed directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my 
eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew
by his face perfectly well: as to his habit, I shall describe it 
afterwards.&nbsp; I ordered nobody to go on shore at first but 
myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat, for the 
affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a good 
way off the Spaniards, where, indeed, I saw nothing of him; and 
if they had not let him go ashore, he would have jumped into the 
sea.&nbsp; He was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to his 
father like an arrow out of a bow.&nbsp; It would have made any 
man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolution, to have seen 
the first transports of this poor fellow?s joy when he came
to his father: how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face,
took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down 
by him; then stood and looked at him, as any one would look at a 
strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together; then lay down
on the ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then 
got up again and stared at him; one would have thought the fellow
bewitched.&nbsp; But it would have made a dog laugh the next day 
to see how his passion ran out another way: in the morning he 
walked along the shore with his father several hours, always 
leading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now 
and then he would come to the boat to fetch something or other 
for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit, or something 
or other that was good.&nbsp; In the afternoon his frolics ran 
another way; for then he would set the old man down upon the 
ground, and dance about him, and make a thousand antic gestures; 
and all the while he did this he would be talking to him, and 
telling him one story or another of his travels, and of what had 
happened to him abroad to divert him.&nbsp; In short, if the same
filial affection was to be found in Christians to their parents 
in our part of the world, one would be tempted to say there would
hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment.</p><br>
<p>But this is a digression: I return to my landing.&nbsp; It 
would be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and 
civilities that the Spaniards received me with.&nbsp; The first 
Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew very well, was he whose life I 
had saved.&nbsp; He came towards the boat, attended by one more, 
carrying a flag of truce also; and he not only did not know me at
first, but he had no thoughts, no notion of its being me that was
come, till I spoke to him.&nbsp; ?Seignior,? said I, 
in Portuguese, ?do you not know me??&nbsp; At which 
he spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the man that was 
with him, threw his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that
I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, telling 
me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he had 
once seen, as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life; he 
said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard 
always knows how, and then, beckoning to the person that attended
him, bade him go and call out his comrades.&nbsp; He then asked 
me if I would walk to my old habitation, where he would give me 
possession of my own house again, and where I should see they had
made but mean improvements.&nbsp; I walked along with him, but, 
alas! I could no more find the place than if I had never been 
there; for they had planted so many trees, and placed them in 
such a position, so thick and close to one another, and in ten 
years? time they were grown so big, that the place was 
inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways as they 
themselves only, who made them, could find.</p><br>
<p>I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications; he 
told me I would say there was need enough of it when they had 
given me an account how they had passed their time since their 
arriving in the island, especially after they had the misfortune 
to find that I was gone.&nbsp; He told me he could not but have 
some pleasure in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone 
in a good ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had 
oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time or other he should 
see me again, but nothing that ever befell him in his life, he 
said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at first as the 
disappointment he was under when he came back to the island and 
found I was not there.</p><br>
<p>As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left 
behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the savages, 
only that their number was so small: ?And,? says he, 
?had they been strong enough, we had been all long ago in 
purgatory;? and with that he crossed himself on the 
breast.&nbsp; ?But, sir,? says he, ?I hope you 
will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by 
necessity, we were obliged for our own preservation to disarm 
them, and make them our subjects, as they would not be content 
with being moderately our masters, but would be our 
murderers.?&nbsp; I answered I was afraid of it when I left
them there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island
but that they were not come back, that I might have put them in 
possession of everything first, and left the others in a state of
subjection, as they deserved; but if they had reduced them to it 
I was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault 
with it; for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned 
villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief.</p><br>
<p>While I was saying this, the man came whom he had sent back, 
and with him eleven more.&nbsp; In the dress they were in it was 
impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he made all 
clear, both to them and to me.&nbsp; First, he turned to me, and 
pointing to them, said, ?These, sir, are some of the 
gentlemen who owe their lives to you;? and then turning to 
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which 
they all came up, one by one, not as if they had been sailors, 
and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if they had 
been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great conqueror:
their behaviour was, to the last degree, obliging and courteous, 
and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well 
became them; and, in short, they had so much more manners than I,
that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how
to return them in kind.</p><br>
<p>The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island 
after my going away is so very remarkable, and has so many 
incidents which the former part of my relation will help to 
understand, and which will in most of the particulars, refer to 
the account I have already given, that I cannot but commit them, 
with great delight, to the reading of those that come after 
me.</p><br>
<p>In order to do this as intelligibly as I can, I must go back 
to the circumstances in which I left the island, and the persons 
on it, of whom I am to speak.&nbsp; And first, it is necessary to
repeat that I had sent away Friday?s father and the 
Spaniard (the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages) in 
a large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over 
the Spaniard?s companions that he left behind him, in order
to save them from the like calamity that he had been in, and in 
order to succour them for the present; and that, if possible, we 
might together find some way for our deliverance 
afterwards.&nbsp; When I sent them away I had no visible 
appearance of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance,
any more than I had twenty years before?much less had I any
foreknowledge of what afterwards happened, I mean, of an English 
ship coming on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not be 
but a very great surprise to them, when they came back, not only 
to find that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the 
spot, possessed of all that I had left behind me, which would 
otherwise have been their own.</p><br>
<p>The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might 
begin where I left off, was of their own part; and I desired the 
Spaniard would give me a particular account of his voyage back to
his countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them 
over.&nbsp; He told me there was little variety in that part, for
nothing remarkable happened to them on the way, having had very 
calm weather and a smooth sea.&nbsp; As for his countrymen, it 
could not be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to 
see him (it seems he was the principal man among them, the 
captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been 
dead some time): they were, he said, the more surprised to see 
him, because they knew that he was fallen into the hands of the 
savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour him as they did 
all the rest of their prisoners; that when he told them the story
of his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for 
carrying them away, it was like a dream to them, and their 
astonishment, he said, was somewhat like that of Joseph?s 
brethren when he told them who he was, and the story of his 
exaltation in Pharaoh?s court; but when he showed them the 
arms, the powder, the ball, the provisions that he brought them 
for their journey or voyage, they were restored to themselves, 
took a just share of the joy of their deliverance, and 
immediately prepared to come away with him.</p><br>
<p>Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were 
obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but to 
trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large 
canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for 
pleasure.&nbsp; In these they came away the next morning.&nbsp; 
It seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready; for they 
had neither clothes nor provisions, nor anything in the world but
what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used
to make their bread.&nbsp; They were in all three weeks absent; 
and in that time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered 
for my escape, as I mentioned in the other part, and to get off 
from the island, leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, 
ungoverned, disagreeable villains behind me that any man could 
desire to meet with?to the poor Spaniards? great 
grief and disappointment.</p><br>
<p>The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the 
Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them
provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also 
they gave them the long paper of directions which I had left with
them, containing the particular methods which I took for managing
every part of my life there; the way I baked my bread, bred up 
tame goats, and planted my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my 
pots, and, in a word, everything I did.&nbsp; All this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them understood 
English well enough): nor did they refuse to accommodate the 
Spaniards with anything else, for they agreed very well for some 
time.&nbsp; They gave them an equal admission into the house or 
cave, and they began to live very sociably; and the head 
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, together with 
Friday?s father, managed all their affairs; but as for the 
Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot 
parrots, and catch tortoises; and when they came home at night, 
the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this had the 
others but let them alone, which, however, they could not find in
their hearts to do long: but, like the dog in the manger, they 
would not eat themselves, neither would they let the others 
eat.&nbsp; The differences, nevertheless, were at first but 
trivial, and such as are not worth relating, but at last it broke
out into open war: and it began with all the rudeness and 
insolence that can be imagined?without reason, without 
provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed to common sense; and 
though, it is true, the first relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when I 
came to examine the fellows they could not deny a word of it.</p><br>
<p>But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must 
supply a defect in my former relation; and this was, I forgot to 
set down among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor
to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board of our 
ship, which I was once afraid would have turned to a second 
mutiny; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his 
courage, and taking us all to his assistance, parted them by 
force, and making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, 
he laid them in irons: and as they had been active in the former 
disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous words the second 
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England, and have 
them hanged there for mutiny and running away with the 
ship.&nbsp; This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to 
do it, frightened some other men in the ship; and some of them 
had put it into the head of the rest that the captain only gave 
them good words for the present, till they should come to same 
English port, and that then they should be all put into gaol, and
tried for their lives.&nbsp; The mate got intelligence of this, 
and acquainted us with it, upon which it was desired that I, who 
still passed for a great man among them, should go down with the 
mate and satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be 
assured, if they behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they 
had done for the time past should be pardoned.&nbsp; So I went, 
and after passing my honour?s word to them they appeared 
easy, and the more so when I caused the two men that were in 
irons to be released and forgiven.</p><br>
<p>But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night; 
the wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two 
men who had been laid in irons had stolen each of them a musket 
and some other weapons (what powder or shot they had we knew 
not), and had taken the ship?s pinnace, which was not yet 
hauled up, and run away with her to their companions in roguery 
on shore.&nbsp; As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to 
seek the rogues; but they could neither find them nor any of the 
rest, for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat 
coming on shore.&nbsp; The mate was once resolved, in justice to 
their roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burned all 
their household stuff and furniture, and left them to shift 
without it; but having no orders, he let it all alone, left 
everything as he found it, and bringing the pinnace way, came on 
board without them.&nbsp; These two men made their number five; 
but the other three villains were so much more wicked than they, 
that after they had been two or three days together they turned 
the two newcomers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would
have nothing to do with them; nor could they for a good while be 
persuaded to give them any food: as for the Spaniards, they were 
not yet come.</p><br>
<p>When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to 
go forward: the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English 
brutes to have taken in their countrymen again, that, as they 
said, they might be all one family; but they would not hear of 
it, so the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and finding 
nothing but industry and application would make them live 
comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of the 
island, but a little more to the west, to be out of danger of the
savages, who always landed on the east parts of the island.&nbsp;
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other to 
lay up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards having 
given them some corn for seed, and some of the peas which I had 
left them, they dug, planted, and enclosed, after the pattern I 
had set for them all, and began to live pretty well.&nbsp; Their 
first crop of corn was on the ground; and though it was but a 
little bit of land which they had dug up at first, having had but
a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them 
with bread and other eatables; and one of the fellows being the 
cook?s mate of the ship, was very ready at making soup, 
puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the milk, 
and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.</p><br>
<p>They were going on in this little thriving position when the 
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humour,
and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told them the 
island was theirs: that the governor, meaning me, had given them 
the possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it; and 
that they should build no houses upon their ground unless they 
would pay rent for them.&nbsp; The two men, thinking they were 
jesting at first, asked them to come in and sit down, and see 
what fine houses they were that they had built, and to tell them 
what rent they demanded; and one of them merrily said if they 
were the ground-landlords, he hoped if they built tenements upon 
their land, and made improvements, they would, according to the 
custom of landlords, grant a long lease: and desired they would 
get a scrivener to draw the writings.&nbsp; One of the three, 
cursing and raging, told them they should see they were not in 
jest; and going to a little place at a distance, where the honest
men had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a 
firebrand, and claps it to the outside of their hut, and set it 
on fire: indeed, it would have been all burned down in a few 
minutes if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him 
away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not without 
some difficulty too.</p><br>
<p>The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man?s 
thrusting him away, that he returned upon him, with a pole he had
in his hand, and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, 
and run into the hut, he had ended his days at once.&nbsp; His 
comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran after him, and 
immediately they came both out with their muskets, and the man 
that was first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down 
that began the quarrel with the stock of his musket, and that 
before the other two could come to help him; and then, seeing the
rest come at them, they stood together, and presenting the other 
ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.</p><br>
<p>The others had firearms with them too; but one of the two 
honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his 
danger, told them if they offered to move hand or foot they were 
dead men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.&nbsp;
They did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but seeing him so 
resolute, it brought them to a parley, and they consented to take
their wounded man with them and be gone: and, indeed, it seems 
the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow.&nbsp; However,
they were much in the wrong, since they had the advantage, that 
they did not disarm them effectually, as they might have done, 
and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an 
account how the rogues had treated them; for the three villains 
studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave them some 
intimation that they did so.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER III?FIGHT WITH CANNIBALS</h2>
<p>But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part 
of the rogueries with which they plagued them continually, night 
and day, it forced the two men to such a desperation that they 
resolved to fight them all three, the first time they had a fair 
opportunity.&nbsp; In order to do this they resolved to go to the
castle (as they called my old dwelling), where the three rogues 
and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to 
have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair
play: so they got up in the morning before day, and came to the 
place, and called the Englishmen by their names telling a 
Spaniard that answered that they wanted to speak with them.</p><br>
<p>It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having 
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for 
distinction, I called the honest men, and he had made a sad 
complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met 
with from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined their 
plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so 
hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three 
kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance, and 
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist
them again, they should be starved.&nbsp; When the Spaniards came
home at night, and they were all at supper, one of them took the 
freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle 
and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could be so cruel, 
they being harmless, inoffensive fellows: that they were putting 
themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it had 
cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such 
perfection as they were then in.</p><br>
<p>One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, ?What had 
they to do there? that they came on shore without leave; and that
they should not plant or build upon the island; it was none of 
their ground.?&nbsp; ?Why,? says the Spaniard, 
very calmly, ?Seignior Inglese, they must not 
starve.?&nbsp; The Englishman replied, like a rough 
tarpaulin, ?They might starve; they should not plant nor 
build in that place.?&nbsp; ?But what must they do 
then, seignior?? said the Spaniard.&nbsp; Another of the 
brutes returned, ?Do? they should be servants, and work for
them.?&nbsp; ?But how can you expect that of 
them?? says the Spaniard; ?they are not bought with 
your money; you have no right to make them servants.?&nbsp;
The Englishman answered, ?The island was theirs; the 
governor had given it to them, and no man had anything to do 
there but themselves;? and with that he swore that he would
go and burn all their new huts; they should build none upon their
land.&nbsp; ?Why, seignior,? says the Spaniard, 
?by the same rule, we must be your servants, 
too.?&nbsp; ?Ay,? returned the bold dog, 
?and so you shall, too, before we have done with 
you;? mixing two or three oaths in the proper intervals of 
his speech.&nbsp; The Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him 
no answer.&nbsp; However, this little discourse had heated them; 
and starting up, one says to the other.&nbsp; (I think it was he 
they called Will Atkins), ?Come, Jack, let?s go and 
have t?other brush with them; we?ll demolish their 
castle, I?ll warrant you; they shall plant no colony in our
dominions.?</p><br>
<p>Upon this they were all trooping away, with every man a gun, a
pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among 
themselves of what they would do to the Spaniards, too, when 
opportunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so 
perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars, only 
that in general they threatened them hard for taking the two 
Englishmen?s part.&nbsp; Whither they went, or how they 
bestowed their time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not
know; but it seems they wandered about the country part of the 
night, and them lying down in the place which I used to call my 
bower, they were weary and overslept themselves.&nbsp; The case 
was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and so take 
the two poor men when they were asleep, and as they acknowledged 
afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts while they were in
them, and either burn them there or murder them as they came 
out.&nbsp; As malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very 
strange they should not have been kept awake.&nbsp; However, as 
the two men had also a design upon them, as I have said, though a
much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it happened, 
and very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad 
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.</p><br>
<p>When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, who it 
seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrade, 
?Ha, Jack, here?s the nest, but the birds are 
flown.?&nbsp; They mused a while, to think what should be 
the occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested 
presently that the Spaniards had given them notice of it; and 
with that they shook hands, and swore to one another that they 
would be revenged of the Spaniards.&nbsp; As soon as they had 
made this bloody bargain they fell to work with the poor 
men?s habitation; they did not set fire, indeed, to 
anything, but they pulled down both their houses, and left not 
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where 
they stood; they tore all their household stuff in pieces, and 
threw everything about in such a manner, that the poor men 
afterwards found some of their things a mile off.&nbsp; When they
had done this, they pulled up all the young trees which the poor 
men had planted; broke down an enclosure they had made to secure 
their cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and plundered
everything as completely as a horde of Tartars would have 
done.</p><br>
<p>The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out, and 
had resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they 
were but two to three; so that, had they met, there certainly 
would have been blood shed among them, for they were all very 
stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due.</p><br>
<p>But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they 
themselves could do to meet; for, as if they had dogged one 
another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here; and
afterwards, when the two went back to find them, the three were 
come to the old habitation again: we shall see their different 
conduct presently.&nbsp; When the three came back like furious 
creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they had been 
about had put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told 
them what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and one of 
them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a 
couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his 
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face, says to 
him, ?And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same 
sauce if you do not mend your manners.?&nbsp; The Spaniard,
who, though a quiet civil man, was as brave a man as could be, 
and withal a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good 
while, and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up
to him, and, with one blow of his fist, knocked him down, as an 
ox is felled with a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, as 
insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard 
immediately; he missed his body, indeed, for the bullets went 
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and
he bled pretty much.&nbsp; The blood made the Spaniard believe he
was more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some 
heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm; but now 
resolving to go through with his work, he stooped, and taking the
fellow?s musket whom he had knocked down, was just going to
shoot the man who had fired at him, when the rest of the 
Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to
shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, and took their 
arms from them.</p><br>
<p>When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the 
Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they 
began to cool, and giving the Spaniards better words, would have 
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that 
was between them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would 
be the best method they could take to keep them from killing one 
another, told them they would do them no harm, and if they would 
live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and 
associate with them as they did before; but that they could not 
think of giving them their arms again, while they appeared so 
resolved to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, and 
had even threatened them all to make them their servants.</p><br>
<p>The rogues were now quite deaf to all reason, and being 
refused their arms, they raved away like madmen, threatening what
they would do, though they had no firearms.&nbsp; But the 
Spaniards, despising their threatening, told them they should 
take care how they offered any injury to their plantation or 
cattle; for if they did they would shoot them as they would 
ravenous beasts, wherever they found them; and if they fell into 
their hands alive, they should certainly be hanged.&nbsp; 
However, this was far from cooling them, but away they went, 
raging and swearing like furies.&nbsp; As soon as they were gone,
the two men came back, in passion and rage enough also, though of
another kind; for having been at their plantation, and finding it
all demolished and destroyed, as above mentioned, it will easily 
be supposed they had provocation enough.&nbsp; They could scarce 
have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell
them theirs: and it was strange enough to find that three men 
should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at all.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having 
thus disarmed them, made light of their threatenings; but the two
Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains
soever it cost to find them out.&nbsp; But the Spaniards 
interposed here too, and told them that as they had disarmed 
them, they could not consent that they (the two) should pursue 
them with firearms, and perhaps kill them.&nbsp; 
?But,? said the grave Spaniard, who was their 
governor, ?we will endeavour to make them do you justice, 
if you will leave it to us: for there is no doubt but they will 
come to us again, when their passion is over, being not able to 
subsist without our assistance.&nbsp; We promise you to make no 
peace with them without having full satisfaction for you; and 
upon this condition we hope you will promise to use no violence 
with them, other than in your own defence.?&nbsp; The two 
Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with great 
reluctance; but the Spaniards protested that they did it only to 
keep them from bloodshed, and to make them all easy at 
last.&nbsp; ?For,? said they, ?we are not so 
many of us; here is room enough for us all, and it is a great 
pity that we should not be all good friends.?&nbsp; At 
length they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, 
living for some days with the Spaniards; for their own habitation
was destroyed.</p><br>
<p>In about five days? time the vagrants, tired with 
wandering, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived 
on turtles? eggs all that while, came back to the grove; 
and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, 
and two more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they 
came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and begged to be 
received again into the society.&nbsp; The Spaniards used them 
civilly, but told them they had acted so unnaturally to their 
countrymen, and so very grossly to themselves, that they could 
not come to any conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen 
and the rest; but, however, they would go to them and discourse 
about it, and they should know in half-an-hour.&nbsp; It may be 
guessed that they were very hard put to it; for, as they were to 
wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged they would send 
them out some bread in the meantime, which they did, sending at 
the same time a large piece of goat?s flesh and a boiled 
parrot, which they ate very eagerly.</p><br>
<p>After half-an-hour?s consultation they were called in, 
and a long debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them with
the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder them; all 
which they owned before, and therefore could not deny now.&nbsp; 
Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators between them; 
and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three 
while they were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three 
to go and rebuild their fellows? two huts, one to be of the
same and the other of larger dimensions than they were before; to
fence their ground again, plant trees in the room of those pulled
up, dig up the land again for planting corn, and, in a word, to 
restore everything to the same state as they found it, that is, 
as near as they could.</p><br>
<p>Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of 
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and 
the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together
again; only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to 
work?I mean for themselves?except now and then a 
little, just as they pleased.&nbsp; However, the Spaniards told 
them plainly that if they would but live sociably and friendly 
together, and study the good of the whole plantation, they would 
be content to work for them, and let them walk about and be as 
idle as they pleased; and thus, having lived pretty well together
for a month or two, the Spaniards let them have arms again, and 
gave them liberty to go abroad with them as before.</p><br>
<p>It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went 
abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent 
and troublesome as ever.&nbsp; However, an accident happened 
presently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all, and
they were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to 
the preservation of their lives.</p><br>
<p>It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard whose 
life I had saved, who was now the governor of the rest, found 
himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any 
sleep: he was perfectly well in body, only found his thoughts 
tumultuous; his mind ran upon men fighting and killing one 
another; but he was broad awake, and could not by any means get 
any sleep; in short, he lay a great while, but growing more and 
more uneasy, he resolved to rise.&nbsp; As they lay, being so 
many of them, on goat-skins laid thick upon such couches and pads
as they made for themselves, so they had little to do, when they 
were willing to rise, but to get upon their feet, and perhaps put
on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps, and they were ready 
for going any way that their thoughts guided them.&nbsp; Being 
thus got up, he looked out; but being dark, he could see little 
or nothing, and besides, the trees which I had planted, and which
were now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only
look up, and see that it was a starlight night, and hearing no 
noise, he returned and lay down again; but to no purpose; he 
could not compose himself to anything like rest; but his thoughts
were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not for what.&nbsp; 
Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going out 
and coming in, another of them waked, and asked who it was that 
was up.&nbsp; The governor told him how it had been with 
him.&nbsp; ?Say you so?? says the other Spaniard; 
?such things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is
certainly some mischief working near us;? and presently he 
asked him, ?Where are the Englishmen??&nbsp; 
?They are all in their huts,? says he, ?safe 
enough.?&nbsp; It seems the Spaniards had kept possession 
of the main apartment, and had made a place for the three 
Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were always quartered 
by themselves, and could not come at the rest.&nbsp; 
?Well,? says the Spaniard, ?there is something 
in it, I am persuaded, from my own experience.&nbsp; I am 
satisfied that our spirits embodied have a converse with and 
receive intelligence from the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting 
the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for our 
advantage, if we knew how to make use of it.&nbsp; Come, let us 
go and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to 
justify the trouble, I?ll tell you a story to the purpose, 
that shall convince you of the justice of my proposing 
it.?</p><br>
<p>They went out presently to go up to the top of the hill, where
I used to go; but they being strong, and a good company, nor 
alone, as I was, used none of my cautions to go up by the ladder,
and pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top,
but were going round through the grove unwarily, when they were 
surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way from 
them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one or two, but of a 
great number.</p><br>
<p>Among the precautions I used to take on the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the 
least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place: and
when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so 
effectually that they that got away were scarce able to give any 
account of it; for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did 
ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it 
was the three savages in our last encounter who jumped into the 
boat; of whom, I mentioned, I was afraid they should go home and 
bring more help.&nbsp; Whether it was the consequence of the 
escape of those men that so great a number came now together, or 
whether they came ignorantly, and by accident, on their usual 
bloody errand, the Spaniards could not understand; but whatever 
it was, it was their business either to have concealed themselves
or not to have seen them at all, much less to have let the 
savages have seen there were any inhabitants in the place; or to 
have fallen upon them so effectually as not a man of them should 
have escaped, which could only have been by getting in between 
them and their boats; but this presence of mind was wanting to 
them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great 
while.</p><br>
<p>We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, 
surprised with this sight, ran back immediately and raised their 
fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they were 
all in, and they again as readily took the alarm; but it was 
impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they were,
but they must all run out to see how things stood.&nbsp; While it
was dark, indeed, they were safe, and they had opportunity enough
for some hours to view the savages by the light of three fires 
they had made at a distance from one another; what they were 
doing they knew not, neither did they know what to do 
themselves.&nbsp; For, first, the enemy were too many; and 
secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided into 
several parties, and were on shore in several places.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; 
and, as they found that the fellows went straggling all over the 
shore, they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them would 
chop in upon their habitation, or upon some other place where 
they would see the token of inhabitants; and they were in great 
perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which, if they 
should be destroyed, would have been little less than starving 
them.&nbsp; So the first thing they resolved upon was to despatch
three men away before it was light, two Spaniards and one 
Englishman, to drive away all the goats to the great valley where
the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the very cave
itself.&nbsp; Could they have seen the savages all together in 
one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they were 
resolved, if there had been a hundred of them, to attack them; 
but that could not be done, for they were some of them two miles 
off from the other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
different nations.</p><br>
<p>After having mused a great while on the course they should 
take, they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the
old savage, Friday?s father, out as a spy, to learn, if 
possible, something concerning them, as what they came for, what 
they intended to do, and the like.&nbsp; The old man readily 
undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the 
savages were, away he went.&nbsp; After he had been gone an hour 
or two, he brings word that he had been among them undiscovered, 
that he found they were two parties, and of two several nations, 
who had war with one another, and had a great battle in their own
country; and that both sides having had several prisoners taken 
in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed all on the same 
island, for the devouring their prisoners and making merry; but 
their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their
mirth?that they were in a great rage at one another, and 
were so near that he believed they would fight again as soon as 
daylight began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had 
any notion of anybody being on the island but themselves.&nbsp; 
He had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could 
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little 
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.&nbsp; Friday?s 
father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to 
lie close, and not be seen; he told them their safety consisted 
in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the 
savages would kill one another to their hands, and then the rest 
would go away; and it was so to a tittle.&nbsp; But it was 
impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their 
curiosity was so importunate that they must run out and see the 
battle.&nbsp; However, they used some caution too: they did not 
go openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the 
woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they might 
securely see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be 
seen by them; but the savages did see them, as we shall find 
hereafter.</p><br>
<p>The battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe the 
Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some of them 
were men of great bravery, of invincible spirit, and of great 
policy in guiding the fight.&nbsp; The battle, they said, held 
two hours before they could guess which party would be beaten; 
but then that party which was nearest our people?s 
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some time more some
of them began to fly; and this put our men again into a great 
consternation, lest any one of those that fled should run into 
the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby 
involuntarily discover the place; and that, by consequence, the 
pursuers would also do the like in search of them.&nbsp; Upon 
this, they resolved that they would stand armed within the wall, 
and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to sally out over 
the wall and kill them, so that, if possible, not one should 
return to give an account of it; they ordered also that it should
be done with their swords, or by knocking them down with the 
stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear of 
raising an alarm by the noise.</p><br>
<p>As they expected it fell out; three of the routed army fled 
for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, 
not in the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a
thick wood for shelter.&nbsp; The scout they kept to look abroad 
gave notice of this within, with this comforting addition, that 
the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way they were 
gone; upon this the Spanish governor, a man of humanity, would 
not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three 
men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in
behind them, and surprise and take them prisoners, which was 
done.&nbsp; The residue of the conquered people fled to their 
canoes, and got off to sea; the victors retired, made no pursuit,
or very little, but drawing themselves into a body together, gave
two great screaming shouts, most likely by way of triumph, and so
the fight ended; the same day, about three o?clock in the 
afternoon, they also marched to their canoes.&nbsp; And thus the 
Spaniards had the island again free to themselves, their fright 
was over, and they saw no savages for several years after.</p><br>
<p>After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den,
and viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty 
men dead on the spot; some were killed with long arrows, which 
were found sticking in their bodies; but most of them were killed
with great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they 
found in the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many
arrows.&nbsp; These swords were strange, unwieldy things, and 
they must be very strong men that used them; most of those that 
were killed with them had their heads smashed to pieces, as we 
may say, or, as we call it in English, their brains knocked out, 
and several their arms and legs broken; so that it is evident 
they fight with inexpressible rage and fury.&nbsp; We found not 
one man that was not stone dead; for either they stay by their 
enemy till they have killed him, or they carry all the wounded 
men that are not quite dead away with them.</p><br>
<p>This deliverance tamed our ill-disposed Englishmen for a great
while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the 
consequences appeared terrible to the last degree, especially 
upon supposing that some time or other they should fall into the 
hands of those creatures, who would not only kill them as 
enemies, but for food, as we kill our cattle; and they professed 
to me that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef and mutton, 
though it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had 
something in it so horrible that it nauseated their very 
stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and filled 
their minds with such unusual terror, that they were not 
themselves for some weeks after.&nbsp; This, as I said, tamed 
even the three English brutes I have been speaking of; and for a 
great while after they were tractable, and went about the common 
business of the whole society well enough?planted, sowed, 
reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country.&nbsp; But
some time after this they fell into such simple measures again as
brought them into a great deal of trouble.</p><br>
<p>They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these three
being stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught 
them to work for them, and as slaves they did well enough; but 
they did not take their measures as I did by my man Friday, viz. 
to begin with them upon the principle of having saved their 
lives, and then instruct them in the rational principles of life;
much less did they think of teaching them religion, or attempt 
civilising and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate 
arguments.&nbsp; As they gave them their food every day, so they 
gave them their work too, and kept them fully employed in 
drudgery enough; but they failed in this by it, that they never 
had them to assist them and fight for them as I had my man 
Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my 
bones.</p><br>
<p>But to come to the family part.&nbsp; Being all now good 
friends?for common danger, as I said above, had effectually
reconciled them?they began to consider their general 
circumstances; and the first thing that came under consideration 
was whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of
the island, and that there were more remote and retired parts of 
it equally adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to 
their advantage, they should not rather move their habitation, 
and plant in some more proper place for their safety, and 
especially for the security of their cattle and corn.</p><br>
<p>Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would
not remove their habitation; because that, some time or other, 
they thought they might hear from their governor again, meaning 
me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure 
to direct them to that side, where, if they should find the place
demolished, they would conclude the savages had killed us all, 
and we were gone, and so our supply would go too.&nbsp; But as to
their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley
where my cave was, where the land was as proper for both, and 
where indeed there was land enough.&nbsp; However, upon second 
thoughts they altered one part of their resolution too, and 
resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and part of
their corn there; so that if one part was destroyed the other 
might be saved.&nbsp; And one part of prudence they luckily used:
they never trusted those three savages which they had taken 
prisoners with knowing anything of the plantation they had made 
in that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less of the
cave at that place, which they kept, in case of necessity, as a 
safe retreat; and thither they carried also the two barrels of 
powder which I had sent them at my coming away.&nbsp; They 
resolved, however, not to change their habitation; yet, as I had 
carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and then
with a grove of trees, and as they were now fully convinced their
safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, they set to 
work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than 
before.&nbsp; For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather 
thrust in stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for some
good distance before the entrance into my apartments, they went 
on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space
of ground from the trees I had set quite down to the side of the 
creek, where I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze 
where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, 
or any sign that there had been any landing thereabouts: these 
stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow, they took care 
to have them generally much larger and taller than those which I 
had planted.&nbsp; As they grew apace, they planted them so very 
thick and close together, that when they had been three or four 
years grown there was no piercing with the eye any considerable 
way into the plantation.&nbsp; As for that part which I had 
planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man?s thigh, 
and among them they had placed so many other short ones, and so 
thick, that it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, 
and it was next to impossible to penetrate it, for a little dog 
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.</p><br>
<p>But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground 
to the right hand and to the left, and round even to the side of 
the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves, to come 
out but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then
lifted up, and placed again from the first stage up to the top: 
so that when the ladder was taken down, nothing but what had 
wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them.&nbsp; This 
was excellently well contrived: nor was it less than what they 
afterwards found occasion for, which served to convince me, that 
as human prudence has the authority of Providence to justify it, 
so it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to 
work; and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am 
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives 
are now, by our own negligence, subjected to.</p><br>
<p>They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and had
no more visits from the savages.&nbsp; They had, indeed, an alarm
given them one morning, which put them into a great 
consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out early one 
morning on the west side or end of the island (which was that end
where I never went, for fear of being discovered), they were 
surprised with seeing about twenty canoes of Indians just coming 
on shore.&nbsp; They made the best of their way home in hurry 
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close 
all that day and the next, going out only at night to make their 
observation: but they had the good luck to be undiscovered, for 
wherever the savages went, they did not land that time on the 
island, but pursued some other design.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER IV?RENEWED INVASION OF SAVAGES</h2>
<p>And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one 
of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the 
three captive slaves, because the fellow had not done something 
right which he bade him do, and seemed a little untractable in 
his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt which he wore 
by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, 
but to kill him.&nbsp; One of the Spaniards who was by, seeing 
him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he 
aimed at his head, but stuck into his shoulder, so that he 
thought he had cut the poor creature?s arm off, ran to him,
and entreating him not to murder the poor man, placed himself 
between him and the savage, to prevent the mischief.&nbsp; The 
fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the Spaniard 
with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to 
serve the savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the 
blow, and with a shovel, which he had in his hand (for they were 
all working in the field about their corn land), knocked the 
brute down.&nbsp; Another of the Englishmen, running up at the 
same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and 
then two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a third 
Englishman fell in upon them.&nbsp; They had none of them any 
firearms or any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, 
except this third Englishman; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, 
with which he made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them 
both.&nbsp; This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more
help coming in they took the three Englishmen prisoners.&nbsp; 
The next question was, what should be done with them?&nbsp; They 
had been so often mutinous, and were so very furious, so 
desperate, and so idle withal, they knew not what course to take 
with them, for they were mischievous to the highest degree, and 
cared not what hurt they did to any man; so that, in short, it 
was not safe to live with them.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, 
that if they had been of his own country he would have hanged 
them; for all laws and all governors were to preserve society, 
and those who were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled 
out of it; but as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the 
generous kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their 
preservation and deliverance, he would use them with all possible
lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of the other two 
Englishmen, who were their countrymen.&nbsp; One of the two 
honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it might not be
left to them.&nbsp; ?For,? says he, ?I am sure 
we ought to sentence them to the gallows;? and with that he
gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed 
to have all the five Englishmen join together and murder all the 
Spaniards when they were in their sleep.</p><br>
<p>When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins,
?How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all?&nbsp; What 
have you to say to that??&nbsp; The hardened villain was so
far from denying it, that he said it was true, and swore they 
would do it still before they had done with them.&nbsp; 
?Well, but Seignior Atkins,? says the Spaniard, 
?what have we done to you that you will kill us?&nbsp; What
would you get by killing us?&nbsp; And what must we do to prevent
you killing us?&nbsp; Must we kill you, or you kill us?&nbsp; Why
will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins??
says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling.&nbsp; Seignior Atkins
was in such a rage at the Spaniard?s making a jest of it, 
that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapon
near him, it was thought he would have attempted to kill the 
Spaniard in the middle of all the company.&nbsp; This 
hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was
to be done.&nbsp; The two Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved 
the poor savage were of the opinion that they should hang one of 
the three for an example to the rest, and that particularly it 
should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his 
hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it,
for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the 
wound he had received that it was thought he could not 
live.&nbsp; But the governor Spaniard still said No; it was an 
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would never 
consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had murdered 
half of them; nay, he said if he had been killed himself by an 
Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they 
should pardon him.</p><br>
<p>This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, 
that there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are 
most apt to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they 
all came into it.&nbsp; But then it was to be considered what 
should be done to keep them from doing the mischief they 
designed; for all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be
used for preserving the society from danger.&nbsp; After a long 
debate, it was agreed that they should be disarmed, and not 
permitted to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon;
that they should be turned out of the society, and left to live 
where they would and how they would, by themselves; but that none
of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should hold any kind of
converse with them, or have anything to do with them; that they 
should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place 
where the rest dwelt; and if they offered to commit any disorder,
so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, 
plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society,
they should die without mercy, and they would shoot them wherever
they could find them.</p><br>
<p>The humane governor, musing upon the sentence, considered a 
little upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, 
?Hold; you must reflect that it will be long ere they can 
raise corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we 
must therefore allow them provisions.?&nbsp; So he caused 
to be added, that they should have a proportion of corn given 
them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which 
time they might be supposed to raise some of their own; that they
should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given 
them, as well for present subsistence as for a store; and that 
they should have tools given them for their work in the fields, 
but they should have none of these tools or provisions unless 
they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any 
of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow-Englishmen.</p><br>
<p>Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to 
shift for themselves.&nbsp; They went away sullen and refractory,
as neither content to go away nor to stay: but, as there was no 
remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place where they
would settle themselves; and some provisions were given them, but
no weapons.&nbsp; About four or five days after, they came again 
for some victuals, and gave the governor an account where they 
had pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation 
and plantation; and it was a very convenient place indeed, on the
remotest part of the island, NE., much about the place where I 
providentially landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out 
to sea in my foolish attempt to sail round the island.</p><br>
<p>Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived 
them in a manner like my first habitation, being close under the 
side of a hill, having some trees already growing on three sides 
of it, so that by planting others it would be very easily covered
from the sight, unless narrowly searched for.&nbsp; They desired 
some dried goat-skins for beds and covering, which were given 
them; and upon giving their words that they would not disturb the
rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them 
hatchets, and what other tools they could spare; some peas, 
barley, and rice, for sowing; and, in a word, anything they 
wanted, except arms and ammunition.</p><br>
<p>They lived in this separate condition about six months, and 
had got in their first harvest, though the quantity was but 
small, the parcel of land they had planted being but 
little.&nbsp; Indeed, having all their plantation to form, they 
had a great deal of work upon their hands; and when they came to 
make boards and pots, and such things, they were quite out of 
their element, and could make nothing of it; therefore when the 
rainy season came on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could
not keep their grain dry, and it was in great danger of 
spoiling.&nbsp; This humbled them much: so they came and begged 
the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did; and in 
four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them, 
big enough to secure their corn and other things from the rain: 
but it was a poor place at best compared to mine, and especially 
as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and 
made several new apartments in it.</p><br>
<p>About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new 
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former 
villainy they had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, 
and had very near been the ruin of the whole colony.&nbsp; The 
three new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the 
laborious life they led, and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances: and a whim took them that they would make a voyage
to the continent, from whence the savages came, and would try if 
they could seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, and
bring them home, so as to make them do the laborious part of the 
work for them.</p><br>
<p>The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no 
further.&nbsp; But they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but 
had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the 
event.&nbsp; And if I may give my opinion, they seemed to be 
under a blast from Heaven: for if we will not allow a visible 
curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events
of things with the divine justice?&nbsp; It was certainly an 
apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that 
brought them to the state they were in; and they showed not the 
least remorse for the crime, but added new villanies to it, such 
as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave 
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what 
he was directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a 
cripple all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
could be had for his cure; and, what was still worse, the 
intentional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards
the formed design they all laid to murder the Spaniards in cold 
blood, and in their sleep.</p><br>
<p>The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and 
in very humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with 
them.&nbsp; The Spaniards very readily heard what they had to 
say, which was this: that they were tired of living in the manner
they did, and that they were not handy enough to make the 
necessaries they wanted, and that having no help, they found they
should be starved; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to 
take one of the canoes which they came over in, and give them 
arms and ammunition proportioned to their defence, they would go 
over to the main, and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them 
from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very 
honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were 
running into; told them they had suffered such hardships upon 
that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy, 
tell them they would be starved or murdered, and bade them 
consider of it.&nbsp; The men replied audaciously, they should be
starved if they stayed here, for they could not work, and would 
not work, and they could but be starved abroad; and if they were 
murdered, there was an end of them; they had no wives or children
to cry after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon 
their demand, declaring they would go, whether they gave them any
arms or not.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they 
were resolved to go they should not go like naked men, and be in 
no condition to defend themselves; and that though they could ill
spare firearms, not having enough for themselves, yet they would 
let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man 
a hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them.&nbsp; In a
word, they accepted the offer; and having baked bread enough to 
serve them a month given them, and as much goats? flesh as 
they could eat while it was sweet, with a great basket of dried 
grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly 
set out in the canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at 
least forty miles broad.&nbsp; The boat, indeed, was a large one,
and would very well have carried fifteen or twenty men, and 
therefore was rather too big for them to manage; but as they had 
a fair breeze and flood-tide with them, they did well 
enough.&nbsp; They had made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of 
four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced 
together; and away they went merrily together.&nbsp; The 
Spaniards called after them ?<i>Bon voyajo</i>;? and 
no man ever thought of seeing them any more.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and 
comfortably they lived, now these three turbulent fellows were 
gone.&nbsp; As for their coming again, that was the remotest 
thing from their thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold, 
after two-and-twenty days? absence, one of the Englishmen 
being abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange men 
coming towards him at a distance, with guns upon their 
shoulders.</p><br>
<p>Away runs the Englishman, frightened and amazed, as if he was 
bewitched, to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all 
undone, for there were strangers upon the island, but he could 
not tell who they were.&nbsp; The Spaniard, pausing a while, says
to him, ?How do you mean?you cannot tell who?&nbsp; 
They are the savages, to be sure.?&nbsp; ?No, 
no,? says the Englishman, ?they are men in clothes, 
with arms.?&nbsp; ?Nay, then,? says the 
Spaniard, ?why are you so concerned!&nbsp; If they are not 
savages they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation 
upon earth but will do us good rather than harm.?&nbsp; 
While they were debating thus, came up the three Englishmen, and 
standing without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed to 
them.&nbsp; They presently knew their voices, and so all the 
wonder ceased.&nbsp; But now the admiration was turned upon 
another question?What could be the matter, and what made 
them come back again?</p><br>
<p>It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring 
where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them
a full account of their voyage in a few words: that they reached 
the land in less than two days, but finding the people alarmed at
their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, 
they durst not go on, shore, but sailed on to the northward six 
or seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by which they 
perceived that the land they saw from our island was not the 
main, but an island: that upon entering that opening of the sea 
they saw another island on the right hand north, and several more
west; and being resolved to land somewhere, they put over to one 
of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on shore; that 
they found the people very courteous and friendly to them; and 
they gave them several roots and some dried fish, and appeared 
very sociable; and that the women, as well as the men, were very 
forward to supply them with anything they could get for them to 
eat, and brought it to them a great way, on their heads.&nbsp; 
They continued here for four days, and inquired as well as they 
could of them by signs, what nations were this way, and that way,
and were told of several fierce and terrible people that lived 
almost every way, who, as they made known by signs to them, used 
to eat men; but, as for themselves, they said they never ate men 
or women, except only such as they took in the wars; and then 
they owned they made a great feast, and ate their prisoners.</p><br>
<p>The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that 
kind; and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the 
moon and to two fingers; and that their great king had two 
hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, and they 
were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast.&nbsp; The 
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing those prisoners; but 
the others mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have 
some of them to carry away for their own eating.&nbsp; So they 
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to
the rising; which was to signify that the next morning at 
sunrising they would bring some for them; and accordingly the 
next morning they brought down five women and eleven men, and 
gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them on their voyage, 
just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a seaport 
town to victual a ship.</p><br>
<p>As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their 
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to 
do.&nbsp; To refuse the prisoners would have been the highest 
affront to the savage gentry that could be offered them, and what
to do with them they knew not.&nbsp; However, after some debate, 
they resolved to accept of them: and, in return, they gave the 
savages that brought them one of their hatchets, an old key, a 
knife, and six or seven of their bullets; which, though they did 
not understand their use, they seemed particularly pleased with; 
and then tying the poor creatures? hands behind them, they 
dragged the prisoners into the boat for our men.</p><br>
<p>The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had 
them, or else they that gave them this noble present would 
certainly have expected that they should have gone to work with 
them, have killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner.&nbsp; But having taken
their leave, with all the respect and thanks that could well pass
between people, where on either side they understood not one word
they could say, they put off with their boat, and came back 
towards the first island; where, when they arrived, they set 
eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being too many of them
for their occasion.&nbsp; In their voyage they endeavoured to 
have some communication with their prisoners; but it was 
impossible to make them understand anything.&nbsp; Nothing they 
could say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was looked 
upon as going to murder them.&nbsp; They first of all unbound 
them; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the 
women, as if they had just felt the knife at their throats; for 
they immediately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be 
killed.&nbsp; If they gave them thing to eat, it was the same 
thing; they then concluded it was for fear they should sink in 
flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill.&nbsp; If they looked at 
one of them more particularly, the party presently concluded it 
was to see whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill 
first; nay, after they had brought them quite over, and began to 
use them kindly, and treat them well, still they expected every 
day to make a dinner or supper for their new masters.</p><br>
<p>When the three wanderers had give this unaccountable history 
or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their 
new family was; and being told that they had brought them on 
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were come up to 
beg some victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other 
two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go 
all down to the place and see them; and did so, and 
Friday?s father with them.&nbsp; When they came into the 
hut, there they sat, all bound; for when they had brought them on
shore they bound their hands that they might not take the boat 
and make their escape; there, I say, they sat, all of them stark 
naked.&nbsp; First, there were three comely fellows, well shaped,
with straight limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age; 
and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two 
more about four or five and twenty; and the fifth, a tall, comely
maiden, about seventeen.&nbsp; The women were well-favoured, 
agreeable persons, both in shape and features, only tawny; and 
two of them, had they been perfect white, would have passed for 
very handsome women, even in London, having pleasant 
countenances, and of a very modest behaviour; especially when 
they came afterwards to be clothed and dressed, though that dress
was very indifferent, it must be confessed.</p><br>
<p>The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our 
Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character, men of the 
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humour, that ever I 
met with: and, in particular, of the utmost modesty: I say, the 
sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five naked 
women, all together bound, and in the most miserable 
circumstances that human nature could be supposed to be, viz. to 
be expecting every moment to be dragged out and have their brains
knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed 
for a dainty.</p><br>
<p>The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, 
Friday?s father, to go in, and see first if he knew any of 
them, and then if he understood any of their speech.&nbsp; As 
soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but 
knew none of them; neither could any of them understand a word he
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women.&nbsp; 
However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy 
them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were 
Christians; that they abhorred eating men or women; and that they
might be sure they would not be killed.&nbsp; As soon as they 
were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such 
awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for it 
seems they were of several nations.&nbsp; The woman who was their
interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they were 
willing to be servants, and to work for the men who had brought 
them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a-dancing;
and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, 
anything that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate 
they were willing to work.</p><br>
<p>The governor, who found that the having women among them would
presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion
some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they 
intended to do with these women, and how they intended to use 
them, whether as servants or as wives?&nbsp; One of the 
Englishmen answered, very boldly and readily, that they would use
them as both; to which the governor said: ?I am not going 
to restrain you from it?you are your own masters as to 
that; but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and 
quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only, 
viz. that you will all engage, that if any of you take any of 
these women as a wife, he shall take but one; and that having 
taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we cannot marry 
any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that, while you stay 
here, the woman any of you takes shall be maintained by the man 
that takes her, and should be his wife?I mean,? says 
he, ?while he continues here, and that none else shall have
anything to do with her.?&nbsp; All this appeared so just, 
that every one agreed to it without any difficulty.</p><br>
<p>Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to 
take any of them?&nbsp; But every one of them answered 
?No.?&nbsp; Some of them said they had wives in 
Spain, and the others did not like women that were not 
Christians; and all together declared that they would not touch 
one of them, which was an instance of such virtue as I have not 
met with in all my travels.&nbsp; On the other hand, the five 
Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is to say, a 
temporary wife; and so they set up a new form of living; for the 
Spaniards and Friday?s father lived in my old habitation, 
which they had enlarged exceedingly within.&nbsp; The three 
servants which were taken in the last battle of the savages lived
with them; and these carried on the main part of the colony, 
supplied all the rest with food, and assisted them in anything as
they could, or as they found necessity required.</p><br>
<p>But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, 
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and that some
two of them should not choose the same woman, especially seeing 
two or three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable 
than the others; but they took a good way enough to prevent 
quarrelling among themselves, for they set the five women by 
themselves in one of their huts, and they went all into the other
hut, and drew lots among them who should choose first.</p><br>
<p>Him that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut 
where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he 
chose; and it was worth observing, that he that chose first took 
her that was reckoned the homeliest and oldest of the five, which
made mirth enough amongst the rest; and even the Spaniards 
laughed at it; but the fellow considered better than any of them,
that it was application and business they were to expect 
assistance in, as much as in anything else; and she proved the 
best wife of all the parcel.</p><br>
<p>When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and 
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned 
upon them again, and they firmly believed they were now going to 
be devoured.&nbsp; Accordingly, when the English sailor came in 
and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable 
cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her with such 
agonies and affection as would have grieved the hardest heart in 
the world: nor was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them
that they were not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched 
the old man, Friday?s father, who immediately let them know
that the five men, who were to fetch them out one by one, had 
chosen them for their wives.&nbsp; When they had done, and the 
fright the women were in was a little over, the men went to work,
and the Spaniards came and helped them: and in a few hours they 
had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging 
apart; for those they had already were crowded with their tools, 
household stuff, and provisions.&nbsp; The three wicked ones had 
pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on
the north shore of the island, so that they continued separated 
as before; and thus my island was peopled in three places, and, 
as I might say, three towns were begun to be built.</p><br>
<p>And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often 
happens in the world (what the wise ends in God?s 
providence are, in such a disposition of things, I cannot say), 
the two honest fellows had the two worst wives; and the three 
reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for 
nothing, and neither seemed born to do themselves good nor any 
one else, had three clever, careful, and ingenious wives; not 
that the first two were bad wives as to their temper or humour, 
for all the five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected
creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they
were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike 
cleanly and neat.&nbsp; Another observation I must make, to the 
honour of a diligent application on one hand, and to the disgrace
of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the other, that when I 
came to the place, and viewed the several improvements, 
plantings, and management of the several little colonies, the two
men had so far out-gone the three, that there was no 
comparison.&nbsp; They had, indeed, both of them as much ground 
laid out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was, because, 
according to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose 
to sow more corn than they wanted; but the difference of the 
cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed, of 
everything else, was easy to be seen at first view.</p><br>
<p>The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their 
huts, so that, when you came to the place, nothing was to be seen
but a wood; and though they had twice had their plantation 
demolished, once by their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, 
as shall be shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, 
and everything was thriving and flourishing about them; they had 
grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, though they
had themselves never seen anything of that kind; and by their 
good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again as any
of the others.&nbsp; They had also found themselves out a retreat
in the thickest part of the woods, where, though there was not a 
natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incessant 
labour of their hands, and where, when the mischief which 
followed happened, they secured their wives and children so as 
they could never be found; they having, by sticking innumerable 
stakes and poles of the wood which, as I said, grew so readily, 
made the grove impassable, except in some places, when they 
climbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on by ways
of their own leaving.</p><br>
<p>As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they
were much civilised by their settlement compared to what they 
were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same 
opportunity; yet one of the certain companions of a profligate 
mind never left them, and that was their idleness.&nbsp; It is 
true, they planted corn and made fences; but Solomon?s 
words were never better verified than in them, ?I went by 
the vineyard of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with 
thorns?: for when the Spaniards came to view their crop 
they could not see it in some places for weeds, the hedge had 
several gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten up 
the corn; perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in, to 
stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting the 
stable-door after the steed was stolen.&nbsp; Whereas, when they 
looked on the colony of the other two, there was the very face of
industry and success upon all they did; there was not a weed to 
be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and 
they, on the other hand, verified Solomon?s words in 
another place, ?that the diligent hand maketh rich?; 
for everything grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and 
without; they had more tame cattle than the others, more utensils
and necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion
too.</p><br>
<p>It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within doors; and having learned the English ways of dressing, 
and cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was
a cook?s mate on board the ship, they dressed their 
husbands? victuals very nicely and well; whereas the others
could not be brought to understand it; but then the husband, who,
as I say, had been cook?s mate, did it himself.&nbsp; But 
as for the husbands of the three wives, they loitered about, 
fetched turtles? eggs, and caught fish and birds: in a 
word, anything but labour; and they fared accordingly.&nbsp; The 
diligent lived well and comfortably, and the slothful hard and 
beggarly; and so, I believe, generally speaking, it is all over 
the world.</p><br>
<p>But I now come to a scene different from all that had happened
before, either to them or to me; and the origin of the story was 
this: Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of
Indians or savages, call them which you please, and there is no 
room to doubt they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their
slaves; but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and 
to our men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as
I did: but having been made sensible, by their experience, that 
their only business was to lie concealed, and that if they were 
not seen by any of the savages they would go off again quietly, 
when their business was done, having as yet not the least notion 
of there being any inhabitants in the island; I say, having been 
made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice 
to all the three plantations to keep within doors, and not show 
themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give 
notice when the boats went to sea again.</p><br>
<p>This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled 
all these measures, and made it known among the savages that 
there were inhabitants there; which was, in the end, the 
desolation of almost the whole colony.&nbsp; After the canoes 
with the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad 
again; and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place 
where they had been, to see what they had been doing.&nbsp; Here,
to their great surprise, they found three savages left behind, 
and lying fast asleep upon the ground.&nbsp; It was supposed they
had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like 
beasts, they were fallen asleep, and would not stir when the 
others went, or they had wandered into the woods, and did not 
come back in time to be taken in.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight and 
perfectly at a loss what to do.&nbsp; The Spaniard governor, as 
it happened, was with them, and his advice was asked, but he 
professed he knew not what to do.&nbsp; As for slaves, they had 
enough already; and as to killing them, there were none of them 
inclined to do that: the Spaniard governor told me they could not
think of shedding innocent blood; for as to them, the poor 
creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of their property,
and they thought they had no just quarrel against them, to take 
away their lives.&nbsp; And here I must, in justice to these 
Spaniards, observe that, let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in 
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men
of any nation whatsoever, in any foreign country, who were so 
universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, 
and so courteous, as these Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had
nothing of it in their very nature; no inhumanity, no barbarity, 
no outrageous passions; and yet all of them men of great courage 
and spirit.&nbsp; Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the insufferable usage of the three Englishmen; and their
justice and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages 
above.&nbsp; After some consultation they resolved upon this; 
that they would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, 
these three men might be gone.&nbsp; But then the governor 
recollected that the three savages had no boat; and if they were 
left to rove about the island, they would certainly discover that
there were inhabitants in it; and so they should be undone that 
way.&nbsp; Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the 
fellows fast asleep still, and so they resolved to awaken them, 
and take them prisoners; and they did so.&nbsp; The poor fellows 
were strangely frightened when they were seized upon and bound; 
and afraid, like the women, that they should be murdered and 
eaten: for it seems those people think all the world does as they
do, in eating men?s flesh; but they were soon made easy as 
to that, and away they carried them.</p><br>
<p>It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home 
to the castle, I mean to my palace under the hill; but they 
carried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their 
country work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting the 
corn, &amp;c.; and afterward they carried them to the habitation 
of the two Englishmen.&nbsp; Here they were set to work, though 
it was not much they had for them to do; and whether it was by 
negligence in guarding them, or that they thought the fellows 
could not mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran away, 
and, taking to the woods, they could never hear of him any 
more.&nbsp; They had good reason to believe he got home again 
soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on 
shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their 
revels as usual, went off in two days? time.&nbsp; This 
thought terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that 
not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account that 
there were people in the island, and also how few and weak they 
were; for this savage, as observed before, had never been told, 
and it was very happy he had not, how many there were or where 
they lived; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of 
their guns, much less had they shown him any of their other 
retired places; such as the cave in the valley, or the new 
retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and the like.</p><br>
<p>The first testimony they had that this fellow had given 
intelligence of them was, that about two months after this six 
canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men in a 
canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island, where they
never used to come before, and landed, about an hour after 
sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation 
of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man had been 
kept.&nbsp; As the chief Spaniard said, had they been all there 
the damage would not have been so much, for not a man of them 
would have escaped; but the case differed now very much, for two 
men to fifty was too much odds.&nbsp; The two men had the 
happiness to discover them about a league off, so that it was 
above an hour before they landed; and as they landed a mile from 
their huts, it was some time before they could come at 
them.&nbsp; Now, having great reason to believe that they were 
betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the two slaves 
which were left, and cause two of the three men whom they brought
with the women (who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to 
lead them, with their two wives, and whatever they could carry 
away with them, to their retired places in the woods, which I 
have spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and 
foot, till they heard farther.&nbsp; In the next place, seeing 
the savages were all come on shore, and that they had bent their 
course directly that way, they opened the fences where the milch 
cows were kept, and drove them all out; leaving their goats to 
straggle in the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages 
might think they were all bred wild; but the rogue who came with 
them was too cunning for that, and gave them an account of it 
all, for they went directly to the place.</p><br>
<p>When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and 
goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who came 
with the women, and who was at their place by accident, away to 
the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire 
speedy help, and, in the meantime, they took their arms and what 
ammunition they had, and retreated towards the place in the wood 
where their wives were sent; keeping at a distance, yet so that 
they might see, if possible, which way the savages took.&nbsp; 
They had not gone far but that from a rising ground they could 
see the little army of their enemies come on directly to their 
habitation, and, in a moment more, could see all their huts and 
household stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortification; for this was a great loss to them, irretrievable, 
indeed, for some time.&nbsp; They kept their station for a while,
till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves 
all over the place, rummaging every way, and every place they 
could think of, in search of prey; and in particular for the 
people, of whom now it plainly appeared they had 
intelligence.</p><br>
<p>The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure
where they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people 
might come that way, and they might come too many together, 
thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile 
farther; believing, as it afterwards happened, that the further 
they strolled, the fewer would be together.&nbsp; Their next halt
was at the entrance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, 
and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and very
large; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving 
to see there what might offer.&nbsp; They had not stood there 
long before two of the savages appeared running directly that 
way, as if they had already had notice where they stood, and were
coming up to attack them; and a little way farther they espied 
three more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all 
coming the same way; besides which, they saw seven or eight more 
at a distance, running another way; for in a word, they ran every
way, like sportsmen beating for their game.</p><br>
<p>The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should 
stand and keep their posture or fly; but after a very short 
debate with themselves, they considered that if the savages 
ranged the country thus before help came, they might perhaps find
their retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost; so they 
resolved to stand them there, and if they were too many to deal 
with, then they would get up to the top of the tree, from whence 
they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as 
their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were landed,
which was near fifty, were to attack them.</p><br>
<p>Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they 
should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take 
the middle party, by which the two and the five that followed 
would be separated; at length they resolved to let the first two 
pass by, unless they should spy them the tree, and come to attack
them.&nbsp; The first two savages confirmed them also in this 
resolution, by turning a little from them towards another part of
the wood; but the three, and the five after them, came forward 
directly to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were 
there.&nbsp; Seeing them come so straight towards them, they 
resolved to take them in a line as they came: and as they 
resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might 
hit them all three; for which purpose the man who was to fire put
three or four small bullets into his piece; and having a fair 
loophole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a 
sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were within about
thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.</p><br>
<p>While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they 
plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had
escaped from them; and they both knew him distinctly, and 
resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, though they 
should both fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that 
if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a
second.&nbsp; But the first was too good a marksman to miss his 
aim; for as the savages kept near one another, a little behind in
a line, he fired, and hit two of them directly; the foremost was 
killed outright, being shot in the head; the second, which was 
the runaway Indian, was shot through the body, and fell, but was 
not quite dead; and the third had a little scratch in the 
shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of 
the second; and being dreadfully frightened, though not so much 
hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a 
hideous manner.</p><br>
<p>The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than
sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made 
the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was, the echoes 
rattling from one side to another, and the fowls rising from all 
parts, screaming, and every sort making a different noise, 
according to their kind; just as it was when I fired the first 
gun that perhaps was ever shot off in the island.</p><br>
<p>However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the
matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the place 
where their companions lay in a condition miserable enough.&nbsp;
Here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were 
within reach of the same mischief, stood all together over the 
wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him 
how he came to be hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, 
told them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after that 
thunder from their gods, had killed those two and wounded 
him.&nbsp; This, I say, is rational; for nothing is more certain 
than that, as they saw no man near them, so they had never heard 
a gun in all their lives, nor so much as heard of a gun; neither 
knew they anything of killing and wounding at a distance with 
fire and bullets: if they had, one might reasonably believe they 
would not have stood so unconcerned to view the fate of their 
fellows, without some apprehensions of their own.</p><br>
<p>Our two men, as they confessed to me, were grieved to be 
obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who had no notion of 
their danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and the 
first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both 
together among them; and singling out, by agreement, which to aim
at, they shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of
them; the fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell 
with the rest; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, 
thought they had killed them all.</p><br>
<p>The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men 
come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns,
which was a wrong step; and they were under some surprise when 
they came to the place, and found no less than four of them 
alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one not at 
all.&nbsp; This obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of
their muskets; and first they made sure of the runaway savage, 
that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of another that 
was hurt in the knee, and put them out of their pain; then the 
man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them, with 
his two hands held up, and made piteous moans to them, by 
gestures and signs, for his life, but could not say one word to 
them that they could understand.&nbsp; However, they made signs 
to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by; and one of the 
Englishmen, with a piece of rope-yarn, which he had by great 
chance in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there 
they left him; and with what speed they could made after the 
other two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of 
them, should find way to their covered place in the woods, where 
their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay.&nbsp; They 
came once in sight of the two men, but it was at a great 
distance; however, they had the satisfaction to see them cross 
over a valley towards the sea, quite the contrary way from that 
which led to their retreat, which they were afraid of; and being 
satisfied with that, they went back to the tree where they left 
their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his 
comrades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn with 
which they had bound him lay just at the foot of the tree.</p><br>
<p>They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing what 
course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what 
number; so they resolved to go away to the place where their 
wives were, to see if all was well there, and to make them 
easy.&nbsp; These were in fright enough, to be sure; for though 
the savages were their own countrymen, yet they were most 
terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge 
they had of them.&nbsp; When they came there, they found the 
savages had been in the wood, and very near that place, but had 
not found it; for it was indeed inaccessible, from the trees 
standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it had been 
directed by those that knew it, which these did not: they found, 
therefore, everything very safe, only the women in a terrible 
fright.&nbsp; While they were here they had the comfort to have 
seven of the Spaniards come to their assistance; the other ten, 
with their servants, and Friday?s father, were gone in a 
body to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were 
kept there, in case the savages should have roved over to that 
side of the country, but they did not spread so far.&nbsp; With 
the seven Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I 
said, were their prisoners formerly; and with them also came the 
savage whom the Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the 
tree; for it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the 
seven men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with 
them; where, however, they were obliged to bind again, as they 
had the two others who were left when the third ran away.</p><br>
<p>The prisoners now began to be a burden to them; and they were 
so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to 
kill them all, believing they were under an absolute necessity to
do so for their own preservation.&nbsp; However, the chief of the
Spaniards would not consent to it, but ordered, for the present, 
that they should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the 
valley, and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and 
have food for their subsistence, which was done; and they were 
bound there hand and foot for that night.</p><br>
<p>When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so 
encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any 
longer there; but taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves, 
with four muskets and a pistol among them, and two stout 
quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the savages.&nbsp; And
first they came to the tree where the men lay that had been 
killed; but it was easy to see that some more of the savages had 
been there, for they had attempted to carry their dead men away, 
and had dragged two of them a good way, but had given it 
over.&nbsp; From thence they advanced to the first rising ground,
where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where 
they had the mortification still to see some of the smoke; but 
neither could they here see any of the savages.&nbsp; They then 
resolved, though with all possible caution, to go forward towards
their ruined plantation; but, a little before they came thither, 
coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages 
all embarked again in their canoes, in order to be gone.&nbsp; 
They seemed sorry at first that there was no way to come at them,
to give them a parting blow; but, upon the whole, they were very 
well satisfied to be rid of them.</p><br>
<p>The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their 
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them
to rebuild, and assist them with needful supplies.&nbsp; Their 
three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least 
inclination to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for 
they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all
was over), came and offered their help and assistance, and did, 
very friendly, work for several days to restore their habitation 
and make necessaries for them.&nbsp; And thus in a little time 
they were set upon their legs again.</p><br>
<p>About two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of
seeing three of the savages? canoes come driving on shore, 
and, at some distance from them, two drowned men, by which they 
had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, 
which had overset some of them; for it had blown very hard the 
night after they went off.&nbsp; However, as some might miscarry,
so, on the other hand, enough of them escaped to inform the rest,
as well of what they had done as of what had happened to them; 
and to whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature, 
which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with sufficient force 
to carry all before them; for except what the first man had told 
them of inhabitants, they could say little of it of their own 
knowledge, for they never saw one man; and the fellow being 
killed that had affirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm
it to, them.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER V?A GREAT VICTORY</h2>
<p>It was five or six months after this before they heard any 
more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had
either forgot their former bad luck, or given over hopes of 
better; when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a most 
formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full of
savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, 
and such like engines of war; and they brought such numbers with 
them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost 
consternation.</p><br>
<p>As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost 
side of the island, our men had that night to consult and 
consider what to do.&nbsp; In the first place, knowing that their
being entirely concealed was their only safety before and would 
be much more so now, while the number of their enemies would be 
so great, they resolved, first of all, to take down the huts 
which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their 
goats to the old cave; because they supposed the savages would go
directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game 
over again, though they did not now land within two leagues of 
it.&nbsp; In the next place, they drove away all the flocks of 
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged 
to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little appearance of 
inhabitants anywhere as was possible; and the next morning early 
they posted themselves, with all their force, at the plantation 
of the two men, to wait for their coming.&nbsp; As they guessed, 
so it happened: these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the 
east end of the island, came ranging along the shore, directly 
towards the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, as 
near as our men could judge.&nbsp; Our army was but small indeed;
but, that which was worse, they had not arms for all their 
number.&nbsp; The whole account, it seems, stood thus: first, as 
to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday, the 
three slaves taken with the women, who proved very faithful, and 
three other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards.&nbsp; To arm 
these, they had eleven muskets, five pistols, three 
fowling-pieces, five muskets or fowling-pieces which were taken 
by me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and 
three old halberds.</p><br>
<p>To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee; but 
they had each a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, 
with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by 
his side a hatchet; also every one of our men had a 
hatchet.&nbsp; Two of the women could not be prevailed upon but 
they would come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, 
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first 
action happened, which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought
with one another; and the women had hatchets too.</p><br>
<p>The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, commanded the 
whole; and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for 
wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under 
him.&nbsp; The savages came forward like lions; and our men, 
which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in their 
situation; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful 
fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of 
bushes as an advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them
pass by and then fire into the middle of them, and as soon as he 
had fired, to make his retreat as nimbly as he could round a part
of the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards, where they 
stood, having a thicket of trees before them.</p><br>
<p>When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way 
in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about 
fifty of them pass by him; then seeing the rest come in a very 
thick throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having loaded 
their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as 
large pistol-bullets.&nbsp; How many they killed or wounded they 
knew not, but the consternation and surprise was inexpressible 
among the savages; they were frightened to the last degree to 
hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others 
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, in the middle of their 
fright, Will Atkins and his other three let fly again among the 
thickest of them; and in less than a minute the first three, 
being loaded again, gave them a third volley.</p><br>
<p>Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as 
they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of 
the body been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, 
the savages had been effectually routed; for the terror that was 
among them came principally from this, that they were killed by 
the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that 
hurt them.&nbsp; But Will Atkins, staying to load again, 
discovered the cheat: some of the savages who were at a distance 
spying them, came upon them behind; and though Atkins and his men
fired at them also, two or three times, and killed above twenty, 
retiring as fast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, 
and killed one of his fellow-Englishmen with their arrows, as 
they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves 
who came with the women.&nbsp; This slave was a most gallant 
fellow, and fought most desperately, killing five of them with 
his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a 
hatchet.</p><br>
<p>Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other
men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the 
Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also; 
for their number was so great, and they were so desperate, that 
though above fifty of them were killed, and more than as many 
wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of 
danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed 
that their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were made 
outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madmen.</p><br>
<p>When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the 
Englishman that were killed behind them: and the savages, when 
they came up to them, killed them over again in a wretched 
manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs 
and wooden swords, like true savages; but finding our men were 
gone, they did not seem inclined to pursue them, but drew 
themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and 
shouted twice, in token of their victory; after which, they had 
the mortification to see several of their wounded men fall, dying
with the mere loss of blood.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together
upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have 
had them march and charge again all together at once: but the 
Spaniard replied, ?Seignior Atkins, you see how their 
wounded men fight; let them alone till morning; all the wounded 
men will be stiff and sore with their wounds, and faint with the 
loss of blood; and so we shall have the fewer to 
engage.?&nbsp; This advice was good: but Will Atkins 
replied merrily, ?That is true, seignior, and so shall I 
too; and that is the reason I would go on while I am 
warm.?&nbsp; ?Well, Seignior Atkins,? says the 
Spaniard, ?you have behaved gallantly, and done your part; 
we will fight for you if you cannot come on; but I think it best 
to stay till morning:? so they waited.</p><br>
<p>But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the 
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a
great noise and hurry among them where they lay, they afterwards 
resolved to fall upon them in the night, especially if they could
come to give them but one volley before they were discovered, 
which they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of the 
Englishmen in whose quarter it was where the fight began, led 
them round between the woods and the seaside westward, and then 
turning short south, they came so near where the thickest of them
lay, that before they were seen or heard eight of them fired in 
among them, and did dreadful execution upon them; in half a 
minute more eight others fired after them, pouring in their small
shot in such a quantity that abundance were killed and wounded; 
and all this while they were not able to see who hurt them, or 
which way to fly.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and 
then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall 
in among them all together.&nbsp; They had in each body eight 
persons, that is to say, twenty-two men and the two women, who, 
by the way, fought desperately.&nbsp; They divided the firearms 
equally in each party, as well as the halberds and staves.&nbsp; 
They would have had the women kept back, but they said they were 
resolved to die with their husbands.&nbsp; Having thus formed 
their little army, they marched out from among the trees, and 
came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud
as they could; the savages stood all together, but were in the 
utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from 
three quarters together.&nbsp; They would have fought if they had
seen us; for as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some 
arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not 
dangerously.&nbsp; But our men gave them no time, but running up 
to them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the 
butt-ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and 
hatchets, and laid about them so well that, in a word, they set 
up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their lives 
which way soever they could.</p><br>
<p>Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally 
wounded in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them; 
the rest, being frightened out of their wits, scoured through the
woods and over the hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble
feet could help them to; and as we did not trouble ourselves much
to pursue them, they got all together to the seaside, where they 
landed, and where their canoes lay.&nbsp; But their disaster was 
not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that 
evening from the sea, so that it was impossible for them to go 
off; nay, the storm continuing all night, when the tide came up 
their canoes were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so 
high upon the shore that it required infinite toil to get them 
off; and some of them were even dashed to pieces against the 
beach.&nbsp; Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got 
little rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as well 
as they could, they resolved to march to that part of the island 
where the savages were fled, and see what posture they were 
in.&nbsp; This necessarily led them over the place where the 
fight had been, and where they found several of the poor 
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight 
disagreeable enough to generous minds, for a truly great man 
though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes 
no delight in his misery.&nbsp; However, there was no need to 
give any orders in this case; for their own savages, who were 
their servants, despatched these poor creatures with their 
hatchets.</p><br>
<p>At length they came in view of the place where the more 
miserable remains of the savages? army lay, where there 
appeared about a hundred still; their posture was generally 
sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth,
and the head put between the two hands, leaning down upon the 
knees.&nbsp; When our men came within two musket-shots of them, 
the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without 
ball, to alarm them; this he did, that by their countenance he 
might know what to expect, whether they were still in heart to 
fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be discouraged, and so he
might manage accordingly.&nbsp; This stratagem took: for as soon 
as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the 
second, they started up upon their feet in the greatest 
consternation imaginable; and as our men advanced swiftly towards
them, they all ran screaming and yelling away, with a kind of 
howling noise, which our men did not understand, and had never 
heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the 
country.</p><br>
<p>At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, 
and they had all gone away to sea: but they did not then consider
that this might probably have been the occasion of their coming 
again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to 
come so many and so often as would quite desolate the island, and
starve them.&nbsp; Will Atkins, therefore, who notwithstanding 
his wound kept always with them, proved the best counsellor in 
this case: his advice was, to take the advantage that offered, 
and step in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of 
the capacity of ever returning any more to plague the 
island.&nbsp; They consulted long about this; and some were 
against it for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and 
live there desperate, and so they should have them to hunt like 
wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have
their plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats 
destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual 
distress.</p><br>
<p>Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a 
hundred men than with a hundred nations; that, as they must 
destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of 
them destroyed themselves.&nbsp; In a word, he showed them the 
necessity of it so plainly that they all came into it; so they 
went to work immediately with the boats, and getting some dry 
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on
fire, but they were so wet that they would not burn; however, the
fire so burned the upper part that it soon made them unfit for 
use at sea.</p><br>
<p>When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came 
running out of the woods, and coming as near as they could to our
men, kneeled down and cried, ?Oa, Oa, Waramokoa,? and
some other words of their language, which none of the others 
understood anything of; but as they made pitiful gestures and 
strange noises, it was easy to understand they begged to have 
their boats spared, and that they would be gone, and never come 
there again.&nbsp; But our men were now satisfied that they had 
no way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but 
effectually to prevent any of these people from ever going home 
again; depending upon this, that if even so much as one of them 
got back into their country to tell the story, the colony was 
undone; so that, letting them know that they should not have any 
mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed every 
one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the sight of 
which, the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our 
people heard plain enough, after which they ran about the island 
like distracted men, so that, in a word, our men did not really 
know what at first to do with them.&nbsp; Nor did the Spaniards, 
with all their prudence, consider that while they made those 
people thus desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at 
the same time upon their plantations; for though it is true they 
had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out 
their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the 
cave in the valley, yet they found out my plantation at the 
bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and 
planting about it; trod all the corn under foot, tore up the 
vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did our men 
inestimable damage, though to themselves not one farthing?s
worth of service.</p><br>
<p>Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet
they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and 
down; for as they were too nimble of foot for our people when 
they found them single, so our men durst not go abroad single, 
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers.&nbsp; The best 
was they had no weapons; for though they had bows, they had no 
arrows left, nor any materials to make any; nor had they any 
edge-tool among them.&nbsp; The extremity and distress they were 
reduced to was great, and indeed deplorable; but, at the same 
time, our men were also brought to very bad circumstances by 
them, for though their retreats were preserved, yet their 
provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled, and what to 
do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew not.&nbsp; The 
only refuge they had now was the stock of cattle they had in the 
valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew there, and 
the plantation of the three Englishmen.&nbsp; Will Atkins and his
comrades were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by an 
arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the 
temple, so that he never spoke more; and it was very remarkable 
that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage 
slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have 
murdered the Spaniards.</p><br>
<p>I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than 
mine was at any time, after I first discovered the grains of 
barley and rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising 
my corn, and my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a 
hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour everything 
they could come at, yet could be hardly come at themselves.</p><br>
<p>When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing 
they concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive the 
savages up to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if
any more came on shore they might not find one another; then, 
that they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of 
them as they could come at, till they had reduced their number; 
and if they could at last tame them, and bring them to anything, 
they would give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live 
upon their daily labour.&nbsp; In order to do this, they so 
followed them, and so terrified them with their guns, that in a 
few days, if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for fear.&nbsp; So dreadfully 
frightened were they that they kept out of sight farther and 
farther; till at last our men followed them, and almost every day
killing or wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods or 
hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the utmost misery 
for want of food; and many were afterwards found dead in the 
woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to death.</p><br>
<p>When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity
moved them, especially the generous-minded Spaniard governor; and
he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive and bring him
to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act as 
interpreter, and go among them and see if they might be brought 
to some conditions that might be depended upon, to save their 
lives and do us no harm.</p><br>
<p>It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being
weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised and made
a prisoner.&nbsp; He was sullen at first, and would neither eat 
nor drink; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals given to
him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, and 
came to himself.&nbsp; They often brought old Friday to talk to 
him, who always told him how kind the others would be to them 
all; that they would not only save their lives, but give them 
part of the island to live in, provided they would give 
satisfaction that they would keep in their own bounds, and not 
come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that they 
should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for their 
bread, and some bread given them for their present subsistence; 
and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his 
countrymen, and see what they said to it; assuring them that, if 
they did not agree immediately, they should be all destroyed.</p><br>
<p>The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number 
to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first 
offer, and begged to have some food given them; upon which twelve
Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian 
slaves and old Friday, marched to the place where they 
were.&nbsp; The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity
of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and 
three live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a 
hill, where they sat down, ate their provisions very thankfully, 
and were the most faithful fellows to their words that could be 
thought of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and 
directions, they never came out of their bounds; and there they 
lived when I came to the island and I went to see them.&nbsp; 
They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed tame 
goats, and milk them: they wanted nothing but wives in order for 
them soon to become a nation.&nbsp; They were confined to a neck 
of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain 
towards the sea before them, on the south-east corner of the 
island.&nbsp; They had land enough, and it was very good and 
fruitful; about a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles 
in length.&nbsp; Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such 
as I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and 
three or four knives; and there they lived, the most subjected, 
innocent creatures that ever were heard of.</p><br>
<p>After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with 
respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was 
about two years after; not but that, now and then, some canoes of
savages came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but 
as they were of several nations, and perhaps had never heard of 
those that came before, or the reason of it, they did not make 
any search or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it
would have been very hard to have found them out.</p><br>
<p>Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that 
happened to them till my return, at least that was worth 
notice.&nbsp; The Indians were wonderfully civilised by them, and
they frequently went among them; but they forbid, on pain of 
death, any one of the Indians coming to them, because they would 
not have their settlement betrayed again.&nbsp; One thing was 
very remarkable, viz. that they taught the savages to make 
wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon outdid their masters: for 
they made abundance of ingenious things in wicker-work, 
particularly baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &amp;c.; as 
also chairs, stools, beds, couches, being very ingenious at such 
work when they were once put in the way of it.</p><br>
<p>My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we 
furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes,
and all things of that kind which they could want.&nbsp; With the
help of those tools they were so very handy that they came at 
last to build up their huts or houses very handsomely, raddling 
or working it up like basket-work all the way round.&nbsp; This 
piece of ingenuity, although it looked very odd, was an exceeding
good fence, as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin; 
and our men were so taken with it that they got the Indians to 
come and do the like for them; so that when I came to see the two
Englishmen?s colonies, they looked at a distance as if they
all lived like bees in a hive.</p><br>
<p>As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, 
useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of 
basket-work as I believe was never seen; it was one hundred and 
twenty paces round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of 
thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet 
high; in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces round,
but built stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight 
corners stood eight very strong posts; round the top of which he 
laid strong pieces, knit together with wooden pins, from which he
raised a pyramid for a handsome roof of eight rafters, joined 
together very well, though he had no nails, and only a few iron 
spikes, which he made himself, too, out of the old iron that I 
had left there.&nbsp; Indeed, this fellow showed abundance of 
ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of: he made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he 
made himself charcoal for his work; and he formed out of the iron
crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he 
made many things, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes, 
bolts and hinges.&nbsp; But to return to the house: after he had 
pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up between 
the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that over 
again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf 
of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry as if
it had been tiled or slated.&nbsp; He owned, indeed, that the 
savages had made the basket-work for him.&nbsp; The outer circuit
was covered as a lean-to all round this inner apartment, and long
rafters lay from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the 
inner house, being about twenty feet distant, so that there was a
space like a walk within the outer wicker-wall, and without the 
inner, near twenty feet wide.</p><br>
<p>The inner place he partitioned off with the same wickerwork, 
but much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had 
six rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a 
door: first into the entry, or coming into the main tent, another
door into the main tent, and another door into the space or walk 
that was round it; so that walk was also divided into six equal 
parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to store up any 
necessaries which the family had occasion for.&nbsp; These six 
spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other 
apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered: As soon as you
were in at the door of the outer circle you had a short passage 
straight before you to the door of the inner house; but on either
side was a wicker partition and a door in it, by which you went 
first into a large room or storehouse, twenty feet wide and about
thirty feet long, and through that into another not quite so 
long; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of
which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner
tent, and served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective 
chambers of the inner circle; and four large warehouses, or 
barns, or what you please to call them, which went through one 
another, two on either hand of the passage, that led through the 
outer door to the inner tent.&nbsp; Such a piece of basket-work, 
I believe, was never seen in the world, nor a house or tent so 
neatly contrived, much less so built.&nbsp; In this great 
bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say, Will Atkins 
and his companion; the third was killed, but his wife remained 
with three children, and the other two were not at all backward 
to give the widow her full share of everything, I mean as to 
their corn, milk, grapes, &amp;c., and when they killed a kid, or
found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well enough; 
though it was true they were not so industrious as the other two,
as has been observed already.</p><br>
<p>One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as for 
religion, I do not know that there was anything of that kind 
among them; they often, indeed, put one another in mind that 
there was a God, by the very common method of seamen, swearing by
His name: nor were their poor ignorant savage wives much better 
for having been married to Christians, as we must call them; for 
as they knew very little of God themselves, so they were utterly 
incapable of entering into any discourse with their wives about a
God, or to talk anything to them concerning religion.</p><br>
<p>The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives 
had made from them was, that they had taught them to speak 
English pretty well; and most of their children, who were near 
twenty in all, were taught to speak English too, from their first
learning to speak, though they at first spoke it in a very broken
manner, like their mothers.&nbsp; None of these children were 
above six years old when I came thither, for it was not much 
above seven years since they had fetched these five savage ladies
over; they had all children, more or less: the mothers were all a
good sort of well-governed, quiet, laborious women, modest and 
decent, helpful to one another, mighty observant, and subject to 
their masters (I cannot call them husbands), and lacked nothing 
but to be well instructed in the Christian religion, and to be 
legally married; both of which were happily brought about 
afterwards by my means, or at least in consequence of my coming 
among them.</p><br>
<h2>CHAPTER VI?THE FRENCH CLERGYMAN?S COUNSEL</h2>
<p>Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and 
pretty much of my runagate Englishmen, I must say something of 
the Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, and in whose
story there are some incidents also remarkable enough.</p><br>
<p>I had a great many discourses with them about their 
circumstances when they were among the savages.&nbsp; They told 
me readily that they had no instances to give of their 
application or ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, 
miserable, dejected handful of people; that even if means had 
been put into their hands, yet they had so abandoned themselves 
to despair, and were so sunk under the weight of their 
misfortune, that they thought of nothing but starving.&nbsp; One 
of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was convinced they 
were in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give 
themselves up to their misery, but always to take hold of the 
helps which reason offered, as well for present support as for 
future deliverance: he told me that grief was the most senseless,
insignificant passion in the world, for that it regarded only 
things past, which were generally impossible to be recalled or to
be remedied, but had no views of things to come, and had no share
in anything that looked like deliverance, but rather added to the
affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this he repeated a 
Spanish proverb, which, though I cannot repeat in the same words 
that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it into an English 
proverb of my own, thus:?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>?In trouble to be troubled,<br>
Is to have your trouble doubled.?</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>He then ran on in remarks upon all the little improvements I 
had made in my solitude: my unwearied application, as he called 
it; and how I had made a condition, which in its circumstances 
was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy 
than theirs was, even now when they were all together.&nbsp; He 
told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence 
of mind in their distress than any people that ever he met with; 
that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the worst men 
in the world to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first 
step in dangers, after the common efforts were over, was to 
despair, lie down under it, and die, without rousing their 
thoughts up to proper remedies for escape.</p><br>
<p>I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that they
were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of 
food, or present sustenance till they could provide for it; that,
it was true, I had this further disadvantage and discomfort, that
I was alone; but then the supplies I had providentially thrown 
into my hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on the 
shore, was such a help as would have encouraged any creature in 
the world to have applied himself as I had done.&nbsp; 
?Seignior,? says the Spaniard, ?had we poor 
Spaniards been in your case, we should never have got half those 
things out of the ship, as you did: nay,? says he, 
?we should never have found means to have got a raft to 
carry them, or to have got the raft on shore without boat or 
sail: and how much less should we have done if any of us had been
alone!?&nbsp; Well, I desired him to abate his compliments,
and go on with the history of their coming on shore, where they 
landed.&nbsp; He told me they unhappily landed at a place where 
there were people without provisions; whereas, had they had the 
common sense to put off to sea again, and gone to another island 
a little further, they had found provisions, though without 
people: there being an island that way, as they had been told, 
where there were provisions, though no people?that is to 
say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there, 
and had filled the island with goats and hogs at several times, 
where they had bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and 
sea-fowls were in such plenty, that they could have been in no 
want of flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas, here they
were only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they 
understood not, and which had no substance in them, and which the
inhabitants gave them sparingly enough; and they could treat them
no better, unless they would turn cannibals and eat men?s 
flesh.</p><br>
<p>They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilise 
the savages they were with, and to teach them rational customs in
the ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted 
upon them as unjust that they who came there for assistance and 
support should attempt to set up for instructors to those that 
gave them food; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for
the instructors of others but those who could live without 
them.&nbsp; They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they 
were driven to; how sometimes they were many days without any 
food at all, the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort 
of savages that lived more indolent, and for that reason were 
less supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had reason 
to believe others were in the same part of the world; and yet 
they found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious 
than those who had better supplies of food.&nbsp; Also, they 
added, they could not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom 
and goodness the governing providence of God directs the events 
of things in this world, which, they said, appeared in their 
circumstances: for if, pressed by the hardships they were under, 
and the barrenness of the country where they were, they had 
searched after a better to live in, they had then been out of the
way of the relief that happened to them by my means.</p><br>
<p>They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived 
amongst expected them to go out with them into their wars; and, 
it was true, that as they had firearms with them, had they not 
had the disaster to lose their ammunition, they could have been 
serviceable not only to their friends, but have made themselves 
terrible both to friends and enemies; but being without powder 
and shot, and yet in a condition that they could not in reason 
decline to go out with their landlords to their wars; so when 
they came into the field of battle they were in a worse condition
than the savages themselves, for they had neither bows nor 
arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave them.&nbsp; So 
they could do nothing but stand still and be wounded with arrows,
till they came up to the teeth of the enemy; and then, indeed, 
the three halberds they had were of use to them; and they would 
often drive a whole little army before them with those halberds, 
and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets.&nbsp;
But for all this they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes, 
and in great danger from their arrows, till at last they found 
the way to make themselves large targets of wood, which they 
covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and
these covered them from the arrows of the savages: that, 
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great danger; and 
five of them were once knocked down together with the clubs of 
the savages, which was the time when one of them was taken 
prisoner?that is to say, the Spaniard whom I 
relieved.&nbsp; At first they thought he had been killed; but 
when they afterwards heard he was taken prisoner, they were under
the greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly have all 
ventured their lives to have rescued him.</p><br>
<p>They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of 
their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till 
they were come to themselves, all but him whom they thought had 
been dead; and then they made their way with their halberds and 
pieces, standing close together in a line, through a body of 
above a thousand savages, beating down all that came in their 
way, got the victory over their enemies, but to their great 
sorrow, because it was with the loss of their friend, whom the 
other party finding alive, carried off with some others, as I 
gave an account before.&nbsp; They described, most 
affectionately, how they were surprised with joy at the return of
their friend and companion in misery, who they thought had been 
devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind?wild men; and 
yet, how more and more they were surprised with the account he 
gave them of his errand, and that there was a Christian in any 
place near, much more one that was able, and had humanity enough,
to contribute to their deliverance.</p><br>
<p>They described how they were astonished at the sight of the 
relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of 
bread?things they had not seen since their coming to that 
miserable place; how often they crossed it and blessed it as 
bread sent from heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to 
their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent 
for their supply; and, after all, they would have told me 
something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and 
pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from whence 
all these new comforts came.&nbsp; But it was impossible to 
express it by words, for their excessive joy naturally driving 
them to unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to describe 
them but by telling me they bordered upon lunacy, having no way 
to give vent to their passions suitable to the sense that was 
upon them; that in some it worked one way and in some another; 
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst 
into tears, others be stark mad, and others immediately 
faint.&nbsp; This discourse extremely affected me, and called to 
my mind Friday?s ecstasy when he met his father, and the 
poor people?s ecstasy when I took them up at sea after 
their ship was on fire; the joy of the mate of the ship when he 
found himself delivered in the place where he expected to perish;
and my own joy, when, after twenty-eight years? captivity, 
I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country.&nbsp; 
All these things made me more sensible of the relation of these 
poor men, and more affected with it.</p><br>
<p>Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found 
them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and
the condition in which I left them.&nbsp; It was their opinion, 
and mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the 
savages, or if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if 
they were twice as many as before; so they had no concern about 
that.&nbsp; Then I entered into a serious discourse with the 
Spaniard, whom I call governor, about their stay in the island; 
for as I was not come to carry any of them off, so it would not 
be just to carry off some and leave others, who, perhaps, would 
be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished.&nbsp; On 
the other hand, I told them I came to establish them there, not 
to remove them; and then I let them know that I had brought with 
me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had been at a great 
charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well for 
their convenience as their defence; and that I had such and such 
particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit their
number, as by the particular necessary employments which they 
were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those things in
which at present they were in want.</p><br>
<p>They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before 
I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one 
by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the first 
animosities that had been among them, and would shake hands with 
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and union of 
interest, that so there might be no more misunderstandings and 
jealousies.</p><br>
<p>Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, said
they had met with affliction enough to make them all sober, and 
enemies enough to make them all friends; that, for his part, he 
would live and die with them, and was so far from designing 
anything against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done 
nothing to him but what his own mad humour made necessary, and 
what he would have done, and perhaps worse, in their case; and 
that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish 
and brutish things he had done to them, and was very willing and 
desirous of living in terms of entire friendship and union with 
them, and would do anything that lay in his power to convince 
them of it; and as for going to England, he cared not if he did 
not go thither these twenty years.</p><br>
<p>The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and 
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill 
conduct, as they had let me know, and they appealed to me for the
necessity they were under to do so; but that Will Atkins had 
behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had with the 
savages, and on several occasions since, and had showed himself 
so faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of them 
all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought he 
merited as much to be trusted with arms and supplied with 
necessaries as any of them; that they had testified their 
satisfaction in him by committing the command to him next to the 
governor himself; and as they had entire confidence in him and 
all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they had merited that 
confidence by all the methods that honest men could merit to be 
valued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced the occasion 
of giving me this assurance, that they would never have any 
interest separate from one another.</p><br>
<p>Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we 
appointed the next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we made
a splendid feast.&nbsp; I caused the ship?s cook and his 
mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old 
cook?s mate we had on shore assisted.&nbsp; We brought on 
shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of the
ship?s provisions, with our punch-bowl and materials to 
fill it; and in particular I gave them ten bottles of French 
claret, and ten bottles of English beer; things that neither the 
Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and which it
may be supposed they were very glad of.&nbsp; The Spaniards added
to our feast five whole kids, which the cooks roasted; and three 
of them were sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the 
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we 
did with their salt meat from on board.</p><br>
<p>After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I 
brought my cargo of goods; wherein, that there might be no 
dispute about dividing, I showed them that there was a 
sufficiency for them all, desiring that they might all take an 
equal quantity, when made up, of the goods that were for 
wearing.&nbsp; As, first, I distributed linen sufficient to make 
every one of them four shirts, and, at the Spaniard?s 
request, afterwards made them up six; these were exceeding 
comfortable to them, having been what they had long since forgot 
the use of, or what it was to wear them.&nbsp; I allotted the 
thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make every one 
a light coat, like a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat 
of the season, cool and loose; and ordered that whenever they 
decayed, they should make more, as they thought fit; the like for
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &amp;c.&nbsp; I cannot express 
what pleasure sat upon the countenances of all these poor men 
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and how well I had 
furnished them.&nbsp; They told me I was a father to them; and 
that having such a correspondent as I was in so remote a part of 
the world, it would make them forget that they were left in a 
desolate place; and they all voluntarily engaged to me not to 
leave the place without my consent.</p><br>
<p>Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, 
particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all 
of them most necessary people; but, above all, my general 
artificer, than whom they could not name anything that was more 
useful to them; and the tailor, to show his concern for them, 
went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made them every one
a shirt, the first thing he did; and, what was still more, he 
taught the women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the 
needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for their 
husbands, and for all the rest.&nbsp; As to the carpenters, I 
scarce need mention how useful they were; for they took to pieces
all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made clever convenient tables,
stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and everything 
they wanted of that kind.&nbsp; But to let them see how nature 
made artificers at first, I carried the carpenters to see Will 
Atkins? basket-house, as I called it; and they both owned 
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before, nor 
anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind; 
and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, 
turning about to me, ?I am sure,? says he, 
?that man has no need of us; you need do nothing but give 
him tools.?</p><br>
<p>Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every 
man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no barrows 
or ploughs; and to every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a 
broad axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any 
were broken or worn out, they should be supplied without grudging
out of the general stores that I left behind.&nbsp; Nails, 
staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all 
sorts of ironwork, they had without reserve, as they required; 
for no man would take more than he wanted, and he must be a fool 
that would waste or spoil them on any account whatever; and for 
the use of the smith I left two tons of unwrought iron for a 
supply.</p><br>
<p>My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such, 
even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for 
now they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each 
shoulder, if there was occasion; and were able to fight a 
thousand savages, if they had but some little advantages of 
situation, which also they could not miss, if they had 
occasion.</p><br>
<p>I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was 
starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober, 
well-educated, religious young woman, and behaved so 
inoffensively that every one gave her a good word; she had, 
indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the ship
but herself, but she bore it with patience.&nbsp; After a while, 
seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving 
upon my island, and considering that they had neither business 
nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking so long
a voyage, both of them came to me and desired I would give them 
leave to remain on the island, and be entered among my family, as
they called it.&nbsp; I agreed to this readily; and they had a 
little plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three 
tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed
like Atkins?s, adjoining to his plantation.&nbsp; Their 
tents were contrived so that they had each of them a room apart 
to lodge in, and a middle tent like a great storehouse to lay 
their goods in, and to eat and to drink in.&nbsp; And now the 
other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same place; 
and so the island was divided into three colonies, and no 
more?viz. the Spaniards, with old Friday and the first 
servants, at my habitation under the hill, which was, in a word, 
the capital city, and where they had so enlarged and extended 
their works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that 
they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large.&nbsp; 
Never was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any 
part of the world; for I verify believe that a thousand men might
have ranged the island a month, and, if they had not known there 
was such a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not 
have found it.&nbsp; Indeed the trees stood so thick and so 
close, and grew so fast woven one into another, that nothing but 
cutting them down first could discover the place, except the only
two narrow entrances where they went in and out could be found, 
which was not very easy; one of them was close down at the 
water?s edge, on the side of the creek, and it was 
afterwards above two hundred yards to the place; and the other 
was up a ladder at twice, as I have already described it; and 
they had also a large wood, thickly planted, on the top of the 
hill, containing above an acre, which grew apace, and concealed 
the place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place 
between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to enter on that 
side.</p><br>
<p>The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were 
four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with 
their wives and children; three savages that were slaves, the 
widow and children of the Englishman that was killed, the young 
man and the maid, and, by the way, we made a wife of her before 
we went away.&nbsp; There were besides the two carpenters and the
tailor, whom I brought with me for them: also the smith, who was 
a very necessary man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take 
care of their arms; and my other man, whom I called 
Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as good almost as twenty 
men; for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very 
merry fellow, and before I went away we married him to the honest
maid that came with the youth in the ship I mentioned before.</p><br>
<p>And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say 
something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me 
out of the ship?s crew whom I took up at sea.&nbsp; It is 
true this man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to 
some hereafter if I leave anything extraordinary upon record of a
man whom, before I begin, I must (to set him out in just colours)
represent in terms very much to his disadvantage, in the account 
of Protestants; as, first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a 
Popish priest; and thirdly, a French Popish priest.&nbsp; But 
justice demands of me to give him a due character; and I must 
say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person; 
exact in his life, extensive in his charity, and exemplary in 
almost everything he did.&nbsp; What then can any one say against
being very sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding 
his profession? though it may be my opinion perhaps, as well as 
the opinion of others who shall read this, that he was 
mistaken.</p><br>
<p>The first hour that I began to converse with him after he had 
agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to 
delight exceedingly in his conversation; and he first began with 
me about religion in the most obliging manner imaginable.&nbsp; 
?Sir,? says he, ?you have not only under 
God? (and at that he crossed his breast) ?saved my 
life, but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, 
and by your obliging civility have taken me into your family, 
giving me an opportunity of free conversation.&nbsp; Now, sir, 
you see by my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your 
nation what yours is; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it
is so, to use my utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring 
all the souls I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace
the Catholic doctrine; but as I am here under your permission, 
and in your family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness as 
well as in decency and good manners, to be under your government;
and therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter into any 
debate on the points of religion in which we may not agree, 
further than you shall give me leave.?</p><br>
<p>I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but 
acknowledge it; that it was true we were such people as they call
heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic I had conversed 
with without falling into inconveniences, or carrying the 
questions to any height in debate; that he should not find 
himself the worse used for being of a different opinion from us, 
and if we did not converse without any dislike on either side, it
should be his fault, not ours.</p><br>
<p>He replied that he thought all our conversation might be 
easily separated from disputes; that it was not his business to 
cap principles with every man he conversed with; and that he 
rather desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a 
religionist; and that, if I would give him leave at any time to 
discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with 
it, and that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to 
defend his own opinions as well as he could; but that without my 
leave he would not break in upon me with any such thing.&nbsp; He
told me further, that he would not cease to do all that became 
him, in his office as a priest, as well as a private Christian, 
to procure the good of the ship, and the safety of all that was 
in her; and though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and he 
could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he 
would do upon all occasions.&nbsp; In this manner we conversed; 
and as he was of the most obliging, gentlemanlike behaviour, so 
he was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, 
as I believe, of great learning.</p><br>
<p>He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the 
many extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had 
befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the 
world; and particularly, it was very remarkable, that in the 
voyage he was now engaged in he had had the misfortune to be five
times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the place whither
any of the ships he was in were at first designed.&nbsp; That his
first intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that he went on 
board a ship bound thither at St. Malo; but being forced into 
Lisbon by bad weather, the ship received some damage by running 
aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged to 
unload her cargo there; but finding a Portuguese ship there bound
for the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he should meet
with a ship there bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order 
to sail to the Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship 
being but an indifferent mariner, had been out of his reckoning, 
and they drove to Fayal; where, however, he happened to find a 
very good market for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore 
resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the Isle 
of May, and to go away to Newfoundland.&nbsp; He had no remedy in
this exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good 
voyage as far as the Banks (so they call the place where they 
catch the fish), where, meeting with a French ship bound from 
France to Quebec, and from thence to Martinico, to carry 
provisions, he thought he should have an opportunity to complete 
his first design, but when he came to Quebec, the master of the 
ship died, and the vessel proceeded no further; so the next 
voyage he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burned
when we took them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the 
East Indies, as I have already said.&nbsp; Thus he had been 
disappointed in five voyages; all, as I may call it, in one 
voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to mention further of 
him.</p><br>
<p>But I shall not make digression into other men?s stories
which have no relation to my own; so I return to what concerns 
our affair in the island.&nbsp; He came to me one morning (for he
lodged among us all the while we were upon the island), and it 
happened to be just when I was going to visit the 
Englishmen?s colony, at the furthest part of the island; I 
say, he came to me, and told me, with a very grave countenance, 
that he had for two or three days desired an opportunity of some 
discourse with me, which he hoped would not be displeasing to me,
because he thought it might in some measure correspond with my 
general design, which was the prosperity of my new colony, and 
perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, 
in the way of God?s blessing.</p><br>
<p>I looked a little surprised at the last of his discourse, and 
turning a little short, ?How, sir,? said I, 
?can it be said that we are not in the way of God?s 
blessing, after such visible assistances and deliverances as we 
have seen here, and of which I have given you a large 
account??&nbsp; ?If you had pleased, sir,? said
he, with a world of modesty, and yet great readiness, ?to 
have heard me, you would have found no room to have been 
displeased, much less to think so hard of me, that I should 
suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and 
deliverances; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the way
of God?s blessing, and your design is exceeding good, and 
will prosper.&nbsp; But, sir, though it were more so than is even
possible to you, yet there may be some among you that are not 
equally right in their actions: and you know that in the story of
the children of Israel, one Achan in the camp removed God?s
blessing from them, and turned His hand so against them, that 
six-and-thirty of them, though not concerned in the crime, were 
the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that 
punishment.?</p><br>
<p>I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him his 
inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, 
and was really so religious in its own nature, that I was very 
sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him to go on; and, in the
meantime, because it seemed that what we had both to say might 
take up some time, I told him I was going to the 
Englishmen?s plantations, and asked him to go with me, and 
we might discourse of it by the way.&nbsp; He told me he would 
the more willingly wait on me thither, because there partly the 
thing was acted which he desired to speak to me about; so we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in what
he had to say.</p><br>
<p>?Why, then, sir,? said he, ?be pleased to 
give me leave to lay down a few propositions, as the foundation 
of what I have to say, that we may not differ in the general 
principles, though we may be of some differing opinions in the 
practice of particulars.&nbsp; First, sir, though we differ in 
some of the doctrinal articles of religion (and it is very 
unhappy it is so, especially in the case before us, as I shall 
show afterwards), yet there are some general principles in which 
we both agree?that there is a God; and that this God having
given us some stated general rules for our service and obedience,
we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend Him, either by 
neglecting to do what He has commanded, or by doing what He has 
expressly forbidden.&nbsp; And let our different religions be 
what they will, this general principle is readily owned by us 
all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow 
presumptuous sinning against His command; and every good 
Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that 
are under his care living in a total neglect of God and His 
commands.&nbsp; It is not your men being Protestants, whatever my
opinion may be of such, that discharges me from being concerned 
for their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, 
that they should live in as little distance from enmity with 
their Maker as possible, especially if you give me leave to 
meddle so far in your circuit.?</p><br>
<p>I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I 
granted all he had said, and thanked him that he would so far 
concern himself for us: and begged he would explain the 
particulars of what he had observed, that like Joshua, to take 
his own parable, I might put away the accursed thing from us.</p><br>
<p>?Why, then, sir,? says he, ?I will take the 
liberty you give me; and there are three things, which, if I am 
right, must stand in the way of God?s blessing upon your 
endeavours here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake and 
their own, to see removed.&nbsp; And, sir, I promise myself that 
you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name them;
especially because I shall convince you, that every one of them 
may, with great ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be 
remedied.&nbsp; First, sir,? says he, ?you have here 
four Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the savages, 
and have taken them as their wives, and have had many children by
them all, and yet are not married to them after any stated legal 
manner, as the laws of God and man require.&nbsp; To this, sir, I
know, you will object that there was no clergyman or priest of 
any kind to perform the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper, 
to write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between 
them.&nbsp; And I know also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has 
told you, I mean of the agreement that he obliged them to make 
when they took those women, viz. that they should choose them out
by consent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way, is 
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women as wives, but 
only an agreement among themselves, to keep them from 
quarrelling.&nbsp; But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of 
matrimony? (so he called it, being a Roman) ?consists
not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one another
as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that 
there is in the contract to compel the man and woman, at all 
times, to own and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to 
abstain from all other women, to engage in no other contract 
while these subsist; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to
provide honestly for them and their children; and to oblige the 
women to the same or like conditions, on their side.&nbsp; Now, 
sir,? says he, ?these men may, when they please, or 
when occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their 
children, leave them to perish, and take other women, and marry 
them while these are living;? and here he added, with some 
warmth, ?How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful 
liberty?&nbsp; And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours 
in this place, however good in themselves, and however sincere in
your design, while these men, who at present are your subjects, 
under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by you 
to live in open adultery??</p><br>
<p>I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more 
with the convincing arguments he supported it with; but I thought
to have got off my young priest by telling him that all that part
was done when I was not there: and that they had lived so many 
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy;
nothing could be done in it now.</p><br>
<p>?Sir,? says he, ?asking your pardon for such
freedom, you are right in this, that, it being done in your 
absence, you could not be charged with that part of the crime; 
but, I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are not, 
therefore, under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an 
end to it.&nbsp; You should legally and effectually marry them; 
and as, sir, my way of marrying may not be easy to reconcile them
to, though it will be effectual, even by your own laws, so your 
way may be as well before God, and as valid among men.&nbsp; I 
mean by a written contract signed by both man and woman, and by 
all the witnesses present, which all the laws of Europe would 
decree to be valid.?</p><br>
<p>I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity 
of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to 
his own party or church, and such true warmth for preserving 
people that he had no knowledge of or relation to from 
transgressing the laws of God.&nbsp; But recollecting what he had
said of marrying them by a written contract, which I knew he 
would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and told him I 
granted all that he had said to be just, and on his part very 
kind; that I would discourse with the men upon the point now, 
when I came to them; and I knew no reason why they should scruple
to let him marry them all, which I knew well enough would be 
granted to be as authentic and valid in England as if they were 
married by one of our own clergymen.</p><br>
<p>I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint 
which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his 
debtor for the first, and thanking him heartily for it.&nbsp; He 
told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the 
second, and hoped I would take it as well; and this was, that 
notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he called 
them, had lived with these women almost seven years, had taught 
them to speak English, and even to read it, and that they were, 
as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and capable of
instruction, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them anything
of the Christian religion?no, not so much as to know there 
was a God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to be served, 
or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not whom, 
was false and absurd.&nbsp; This he said was an unaccountable 
neglect, and what God would certainly call them to account for, 
and perhaps at last take the work out of their hands.&nbsp; He 
spoke this very affectionately and warmly.</p><br>
<p>?I am persuaded,? says he, ?had those men 
lived in the savage country whence their wives came, the savages 
would have taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters,
and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so far as I can 
see, have taken with them to teach the knowledge of the true 
God.&nbsp; Now, sir,? said he, ?though I do not 
acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad to 
see the devil?s servants and the subjects of his kingdom 
taught to know religion; and that they might, at least, hear of 
God and a Redeemer, and the resurrection, and of a future 
state?things which we all believe; that they might, at 
least, be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true Church
than they are now in the public profession of idolatry and 
devil-worship.?</p><br>
<p>I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms and embraced him
eagerly.&nbsp; ?How far,? said I to him, ?have 
I been from understanding the most essential part of a Christian,
viz. to love the interest of the Christian Church, and the good 
of other men?s souls!&nbsp; I scarce have known what 
belongs to the being a Christian.???Oh, sir! do
not say so,? replied he; ?this thing is not your 
fault.???No,? said I; ?but why did 
I never lay it to heart as well as you????It is
not too late yet,? said he; ?be not too forward to 
condemn yourself.???But what can be done 
now?? said I: ?you see I am going 
away.???Will you give me leave to talk with 
these poor men about it????Yes, with all my 
heart,? said I: ?and oblige them to give heed to what
you say too.???As to that,? said he, 
?we must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is your 
business to assist them, encourage them, and instruct them; and 
if you give me leave, and God His blessing, I do not doubt but 
the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home to the great circle
of Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all embrace,
and that even while you stay here.?&nbsp; Upon this I said,
?I shall not only give you leave, but give you a thousand 
thanks for it.?</p><br>
<p>I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to 
blame.&nbsp; ?Why, really,? says he, ?it is of 
the same nature.&nbsp; It is about your poor savages, who are, as
I may say, your conquered subjects.&nbsp; It is a maxim, sir, 
that is or ought to be received among all Christians, of what 
church or pretended church soever, that the Christian knowledge 
ought to be propagated by all possible means and on all possible 
occasions.&nbsp; It is on this principle that our Church sends 
missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that our clergy, 
even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous
voyages, and the most dangerous residence amongst murderers and 
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to 
bring them over to embrace the Christian faith.&nbsp; Now, sir, 
you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty
poor savages brought over from a state of idolatry to the 
knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you
can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth 
the expense of a man?s whole life.?</p><br>
<p>I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to 
say.&nbsp; I had here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God 
and religion before me.&nbsp; As for me, I had not so much as 
entertained a thought of this in my heart before, and I believe I
should not have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as
slaves, and people whom, had we not had any work for them to do, 
we would have used as such, or would have been glad to have 
transported them to any part of the world; for our business was 
to get rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if they 
had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their 
own.&nbsp; I was confounded at his discourse, and knew not what 
answer to make him.</p><br>
<p>He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion.&nbsp; 
?Sir,? says he, ?I shall be very sorry if what 
I have said gives you any offence.???No, 
no,? said I, ?I am offended with nobody but myself; 
but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I should 
never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting what 
notice I am able to take of it now.&nbsp; You know, sir,? 
said I, ?what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East
Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be 
an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the
men lying all this while at victuals and wages on the 
owners? account.&nbsp; It is true, I agreed to be allowed 
twelve days here, and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds 
sterling <i>per diem</i> demurrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage
above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen already; so 
that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work unless I would 
suffer myself to be left behind here again; in which case, if 
this single ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I 
should be just in the same condition that I was left in here at 
first, and from which I have been so wonderfully 
delivered.?&nbsp; He owned the case was very hard upon me 
as to my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience whether the 
blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all
I had in the world for.&nbsp; I was not so sensible of that as he
was.&nbsp; I replied to him thus: ?Why, sir, it is a 
valuable thing, indeed, to be an instrument in God?s hand 
to convert thirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ: but 
as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so it
seems so naturally to fall in the way of your profession; how is 
it, then, that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it 
than to press me to do it??</p><br>
<p>Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, 
and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow.&nbsp; 
?I most heartily thank God and you, sir,? said he, 
?for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work; and 
if you think yourself discharged from it, and desire me to 
undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a happy 
reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, 
disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I am dropped at last
into so glorious a work.?</p><br>
<p>I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this
to me; his eyes sparkled like fire; his face glowed, and his 
colour came and went; in a word, he was fired with the joy of 
being embarked in such a work.&nbsp; I paused a considerable 
while before I could tell what to say to him; for I was really 
surprised to find a man of such sincerity, and who seemed 
possessed of a zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men.&nbsp; But 
after I had considered it a while, I asked him seriously if he 
was in earnest, and that he would venture, on the single 
consideration of an attempt to convert those poor people, to be 
locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his life, and at 
last might not know whether he should be able to do them good or 
not?&nbsp; He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a 
venture?&nbsp; ?Pray, sir,? said he, ?what do 
you think I consented to go in your ship to the East Indies 
for????ay,? said I, ?that I know 
not, unless it was to preach to the 
Indians.???Doubtless it was,? said he; 
?and do you think, if I can convert these thirty-seven men 
to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time, though I 
should never be fetched off the island again??nay, is it 
not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than my life 
is, or the life of twenty more of the same profession?&nbsp; Yes,
sir,? says he, ?I would give God thanks all my days 
if I could be made the happy instrument of saving the souls of 
those poor men, though I were never to get my foot off this 
island or see my native country any more.&nbsp; But since you 
will honour me with putting me into this work, for which I will 
pray for you all the days of my life, I have one humble petition 
to you besides.???What is that?? said 
I.??Why,? says he, ?it is, that you will 
leave your man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and 
to assist me; for without some help I cannot speak to them, or 
they to me.?</p><br>
<p>I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I 
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons: 
he had been the companion of my travels; he was not only faithful
to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had 
resolved to do something considerable for him if he out-lived me,
as it was probable he would.&nbsp; Then I knew that, as I had 
bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite confound him to
bring him to embrace another religion; and he would never, while 
his eyes were open, believe that his old master was a heretic, 
and would be damned; and this might in the end ruin the poor 
fellow?s principles, and so turn him back again to his 
first idolatry.&nbsp; However, a sudden thought relieved me in 
this strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say that I 
was willing to part with Friday on any account whatever, though a
work that to him was of more value than his life ought to be of 
much more value than the keeping or parting with a servant.&nbsp;
On the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no means 
agree to part with me; and I could not force him to it without 
his consent, without manifest injustice; because I had promised I
would never send him away, and he had promised and engaged that 
he would never leave me, unless I sent him away.</p><br>
<p>He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational 
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one 
word of their language, nor they one of his.&nbsp; To remove this
difficulty, I told him Friday?s father had learned Spanish,
which I found he also understood, and he should serve him as an 
interpreter.&nbsp; So he was much better satisfied, and nothing 
could persuade him but he would stay and endeavour to convert 
them; but Providence gave another very happy turn to all 
this.</p><br>
<p>I come back now to the first part of his objections.&nbsp; 
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and
after some account given them of what I had done for them, viz. 
what necessary things I had provided for them, and how they were 
distributed, which they were very sensible of, and very thankful 
for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and
gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had taken of
it; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I 
first asked them if they were married men or bachelors?&nbsp; 
They soon explained their condition to me, and showed that two of
them were widowers, and the other three were single men, or 
bachelors.&nbsp; I asked them with what conscience they could 
take these women, and call them their wives, and have so many 
children by them, and not be lawfully married to them?&nbsp; They
all gave me the answer I expected, viz. that there was nobody to 
marry them; that they agreed before the governor to keep them as 
their wives, and to maintain them and own them as their wives; 
and they thought, as things stood with them, they were as legally
married as if they had been married by a parson and with all the 
formalities in the world.</p><br>
<p>I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of 
God, and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; 
but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the 
poor women and children hereafter; and that their wives, being 
poor desolate women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way 
to help themselves.&nbsp; I therefore told them that unless I was
assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but 
would take care that what I did should be for the women and 
children without them; and that, unless they would give me some 
assurances that they would marry the women, I could not think it 
was convenient they should continue together as man and wife; for
that it was both scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they
could not think would bless them if they went on thus.</p><br>
<p>All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially 
Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they 
loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own 
native country, and would not leave them on any account whatever;
and they did verily believe that their wives were as virtuous and
as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for 
them and for their children, as any woman could possibly do: and 
they would not part with them on any account.&nbsp; Will Atkins, 
for his own particular, added that if any man would take him 
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and make him 
captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he would not go with 
him if he might not carry his wife and children with him; and if 
there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her now
with all his heart.</p><br>
<p>This was just as I would have it.&nbsp; The priest was not 
with me at that moment, but he was not far off; so to try him 
further, I told him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was 
sincere, I would have him married next morning, and bade him 
consider of it, and talk with the rest.&nbsp; He said, as for 
himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he was very ready
to do it, and was glad I had a minister with me, and he believed 
they would be all willing also.&nbsp; I then told him that my 
friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak 
English, but I would act the clerk between them.&nbsp; He never 
so much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which 
was, indeed, what I was afraid of.&nbsp; We then parted, and I 
went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with 
his companions.&nbsp; I desired the French gentleman not to say 
anything to them till the business was thoroughly ripe; and I 
told him what answer the men had given me.</p><br>
<p>Before I went from their quarter they all came to me and told 
me they had been considering what I had said; that they were glad
to hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they were very 
willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally
married as soon as I pleased; for they were far from desiring
