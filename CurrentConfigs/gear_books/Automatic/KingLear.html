<p id="id00064">[Enter Kent, Gloster, and Edmund.]</p><br>

<p id="id00065">Kent.<br>

I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than<br>

Cornwall.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00066">Glou.
It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the
kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for
equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make
choice of either's moiety.</p><br>

<p id="id00067">Kent.<br>

Is not this your son, my lord?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00068">Glou.
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often
blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.</p><br>

<p id="id00069">Kent.<br>

I cannot conceive you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00070">Glou.
Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon she grew
round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she
had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p><br>

<p id="id00071">Kent.<br>

I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00072">Glou.
But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than
this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came
something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was
his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged.???Do you know this noble gentleman,
Edmund?</p><br>

<p id="id00073">Edm.<br>

No, my lord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00074">Glou.<br>

Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.???<br>

Give me the map there.???Know that we have divided<br>

In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent<br>

To shake all cares and business from our age;<br>

Conferring them on younger strengths, while we<br>

Unburden'd crawl toward death.???Our son of Cornwall,<br>

And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br>

We have this hour a constant will to publish<br>

Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife<br>

May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br>

Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,<br>

Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br>

And here are to be answer'd.???Tell me, my daughters,???<br>

Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br>

Interest of territory, cares of state,???<br>

Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br>

That we our largest bounty may extend<br>

Where nature doth with merit challenge.???Goneril,<br>

Our eldest-born, speak first.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00085">Gon.<br>

Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;<br>

Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;<br>

Beyond what can be valu'd, rich or rare;<br>

No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br>

As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;<br>

A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;<br>

Beyond all manner of so much I love you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00086">Cor.<br>

[Aside.] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00087">Lear.<br>

Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,<br>

With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,<br>

With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br>

We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue<br>

Be this perpetual.???What says our second daughter,<br>

Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00088">Reg.<br>

Sir, I am made of the selfsame metal that my sister is,<br>

And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br>

I find she names my very deed of love;<br>

Only she comes too short,???that I profess<br>

Myself an enemy to all other joys<br>

Which the most precious square of sense possesses,<br>

And find I am alone felicitate<br>

In your dear highness' love.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00089">Cor.<br>

[Aside.] Then poor Cordelia!<br>

And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's<br>

More richer than my tongue.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00090">Lear.<br>

To thee and thine hereditary ever<br>

Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;<br>

No less in space, validity, and pleasure<br>

Than that conferr'd on Goneril.???Now, our joy,<br>

Although the last, not least; to whose young love<br>

The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br>

Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw<br>

A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00091">Cor.<br>

Nothing, my lord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00092">Lear.<br>

Nothing!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00093">Cor.<br>

Nothing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00094">Lear.<br>

Nothing can come of nothing: speak again.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00095">Cor.<br>

Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br>

My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty<br>

According to my bond; no more nor less.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00096">Lear.<br>

How, how, Cordelia? mend your speech a little,<br>

Lest you may mar your fortunes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00097">Cor.<br>

Good my lord,<br>

You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I<br>

Return those duties back as are right fit,<br>

Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br>

Why have my sisters husbands if they say<br>

They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br>

That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br>

Half my love with him, half my care and duty:<br>

Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,<br>

To love my father all.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00098">Lear.<br>

But goes thy heart with this?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00099">Cor.<br>

Ay, good my lord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00100">Lear.<br>

So young, and so untender?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00101">Cor.<br>

So young, my lord, and true.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00102">Lear.<br>

Let it be so,???thy truth then be thy dower:<br>

For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br>

The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;<br>

By all the operation of the orbs,<br>

From whom we do exist and cease to be;<br>

Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br>

Propinquity, and property of blood,<br>

And as a stranger to my heart and me<br>

Hold thee, from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br>

Or he that makes his generation messes<br>

To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br>

Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,<br>

As thou my sometime daughter.<br>

<p id="id00104">Lear.<br>

Peace, Kent!<br>

Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br>

I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest<br>

So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br>

Call Burgundy!???Cornwall and Albany,<br>

Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br>

With reservation of an hundred knights,<br>

The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00107">Kent.<br>

Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br>

The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly<br>

When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?<br>

Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak<br>

When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound<br>

When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;<br>

And in thy best consideration check<br>

This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,<br>

Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;<br>

Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound<br>

Reverbs no hollowness.<br>

To shield thee from diseases of the world;<br>

If aught within that little seeming substance,<br>

And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,<br>

Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd<br>

<p id="id00130">France.<br>

This is most strange,<br>

That she, who even but now was your best object,<br>

The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br>

Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time<br>

Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle<br>

So many folds of favour. Sure her offence<br>

Must be of such unnatural degree<br>

That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection<br>

Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her<br>

Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br>

Should never plant in me.<br>

<p id="id00150">Gon.
You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we

'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself.</p><br>

[Reads.] 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world
bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways,
not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that
of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live
the beloved of your brother,
'EDGAR.'
Hum! Conspiracy????'Sleep till I waked him,???you should enjoy half
his revenue.'???My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart
and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? who brought it?</p><br>

<p id="id00176">Edm.
It was not brought me, my lord, there's the cunning of it; I
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.</p><br>

<p id="id00177">Glou.<br>

<p id="id00181">Glou.<br>

Hath he never before sounded you in this business?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00182">Edm.
Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father
should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</p><br>

<p id="id00184">Edm.
I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;
where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour, and to no other pretence of danger.</p><br>

<p id="id00190">Edm.
I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall
find means, and acquaint you withal.</p><br>

<p id="id00191">Glou.
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:
though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in
countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked
'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from
bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the
best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.???Find out
this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
carefully.???And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
offence, honesty!???'Tis strange.</p><br>

<p id="id00192">[Exit.]</p><br>

<p id="id00193">Edm.
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are
sick in fortune,???often the surfeit of our own behaviour,???we
make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his
goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded
with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under
ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.???Tut! I
should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the

<p id="id00197">Edm.

what should follow these eclipses.</p><br>

<p id="id00198">Edg.<br>

Do you busy yourself with that?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00199">Edm.
I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of
unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,
dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences,
banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,
and I know not what.</p><br>

<p id="id00205">Edm.
Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word
or countenance?</p><br>

<p id="id00206">Edg.<br>

None at all.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00207">Edm.
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay.</p><br>

<p id="id00208">Edg.<br>

Some villain hath done me wrong.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00209">Edm.
That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to
my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord
speak: pray you, go; there's my key.???If you do stir abroad, go

<p id="id00306">Fool.
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and
a sweet one?</p><br>

<p id="id00307">Lear.<br>

No, lad; teach me.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00308">Fool.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lord that counsell'd thee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give away thy land,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come place him here by me,???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do thou for him stand:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet and bitter fool<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will presently appear;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one in motley here,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other found out there.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00309">Lear.<br>

Dost thou call me fool, boy?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00310">Fool.
All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born
with.</p><br>

<p id="id00311">Kent.<br>

This is not altogether fool, my lord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00312">Fool.
No, faith; lords and great men will not let me: if I had a
monopoly out, they would have part on't and loads too: they
will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be
snatching.???Nuncle, give me an egg, and I'll give thee two
crowns.</p><br>

<p id="id00313">Lear.<br>

What two crowns shall they be?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00314">Fool.
Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle and eat up the
meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i'
the middle and gav'st away both parts, thou borest thine ass on
thy back o'er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in
this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.
[Singing.]
 Fools had ne'er less grace in a year;
 For wise men are grown foppish,
 And know not how their wits to wear,
 Their manners are so apish.</p><br>

<p id="id00315">Lear.<br>

When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00316">Fool.<br>

I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou mad'st thy daughters thy<br>

mothers; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and puttest down<br>

thine own breeches,<br>

[Singing.]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they for sudden joy did weep,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I for sorrow sung,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such a king should play bo-peep<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go the fools among.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00317">Pr'ythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to
lie; I would fain learn to lie.</p><br>

<p id="id00318">Lear.<br>

An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00319">Fool.
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they'll have me
whipped for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipped for lying;
and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be
any kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be thee,
nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides, and left nothing
i' the middle:???here comes one o' the parings.</p><br>

<p id="id00320">[Enter Goneril.]</p><br>

<p id="id00321">Lear.
How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you
are too much of late i' the frown.</p><br>

<p id="id00322">Fool.
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure: I am better
than thou art; I am a fool, thou art nothing.???Yes, forsooth, I
will hold my tongue. So your face [To Goneril.] bids me, though

Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,<br>

But other of your insolent retinue<br>

Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth<br>

In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,<br>

I had thought, by making this well known unto you,<br>

To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,<br>

By what yourself too late have spoke and done,<br>

That you protect this course, and put it on<br>

By your allowance; which if you should, the fault<br>

Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,<br>

Will call discreet proceeding.<br>

So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When priests are more in word than matter;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When brewers mar their malt with water;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When nobles are their tailors' tutors;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When every case in law is right;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No squire in debt nor no poor knight;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When slanders do not live in tongues;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When usurers tell their gold i' the field;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bawds and whores do churches build;???<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall the realm of Albion<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to great confusion:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the time, who lives to see't,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That going shall be us'd with feet.<br>

This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.<br>
