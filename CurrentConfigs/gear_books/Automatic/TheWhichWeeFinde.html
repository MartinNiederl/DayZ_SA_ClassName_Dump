<p id="id00053" style="margin-top: 5em">Executive Director's Notes:</p><br>

<p id="id00054">In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p><br>

<p id="id00055">&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnardo. Who's there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold<br>

your selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00056"> Bar. Long liue the King</p><br>

<p id="id00057">***</p><br>

<p id="id00058">As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .</p><br>

<p id="id00059">The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc. This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p><br>

<p id="id00060">You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare. My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose. To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p><br>

<p id="id00061">So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file: you may see errors
that are "not" errors. . . .</p><br>

<p id="id00062">So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's First Folio.</p><br>

<p id="id00065" style="margin-top: 2em">Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't. This is a copy of<br>

Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can come in<br>

ASCII to the printed text.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00066">The play Pericles, Prince of Tyre is missing from this edition
of the First Folio because it wasn't printed in the First Folio.
The Sonnets and other poems of Shakespeare are also missing
because they also were not printed in the First Folio.</p><br>

<p id="id00067">The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae. I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text. I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them. Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added. So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.</p><br>

<p id="id00068">Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio. So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions. This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run. The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies. This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.</p><br>

<p id="id00069">If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors. I wish to make this the best
etext possible. My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com. I hope that you enjoy this.</p><br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00080">Right Honourable,</p><br>

<p id="id00081">Whilst we studie to be thankful in our particular, for the many
favors we have received from your L.L. we are falne upon the ill
fortune, to mingle two the most diverse things that can bee, feare,
and rashnesse; rashnesse in the enterprize, and feare of the
successe. For, when we valew the places your H.H. sustaine, we
cannot but know their dignity greater, then to descend to the
reading of these trifles: and, while we name them trifles, we have
depriv'd our selves of the defence of our Dedication. But since
your L.L. have beene pleas'd to thinke these trifles some-thing,
heeretofore; and have prosequuted both them, and their Authour
living, with so much favour: we hope, that (they out-living him,
and he not having the fate, common with some, to be exequutor to
his owne writings) you will use the like indulgence toward them,
you have done unto their parent. There is a great difference,
whether any Booke choose his Patrones, or finde them: This hath
done both. For, so much were your L.L. likings of the severall
parts, when they were acted, as before they were published, the
Volume ask'd to be yours. We have but collected them, and done
an office to the dead, to procure his Orphanes, Guardians; without
ambition either of selfe-profit, or fame: onely to keepe the memory
of so worthy a Friend, &amp; Fellow alive, as was our S H A K E S
P E A R E , by humble offer of his playes, to your most noble
patronage. Wherein, as we have justly observed, no man to come
neere your L.L. but with a kind of religious addresse; it hath bin
the height of our care, who are the Presenters, to make the present
worthy of your H.H. by the perfection. But, there we must also
crave our abilities to be considerd, my Lords. We cannot go
beyond our owne powers. Country hands reach foorth milke,
creame, fruites, or what they have : and many Nations (we have
heard) that had not gummes &amp; incense, obtained their requests
with a leavened Cake. It was no fault to approach their Gods, by
what meanes they could: And the most, though meanest, of thins
are made more precious, when they are dedicated to Temples. In
that name therefore, we most humbly consecrate to your H.H.
these remaines of your servant Shakespeare; that what delight is in
them, may be ever your L.L. the reputation his, &amp; the faults ours, if
any be committed, by a payre so carefull to shew their gratitude
both to the living, and the dead, as is.</p><br>

<p id="id00082">Your Lordshippes most bounden,</p><br>

<h5 id="id00083">JOHN HEMINGE.
HENRY CONDELL.</h5>

<p id="id00084"> To the great Variety of Readers.</p><br>

<p id="id00085">From the most able, to him that can but spell : There you are
number'd. We had rather you were weighd. Especially, when the
fate of all Bookes depends upon your capacities : and not of your
heads alone, but of your purses. Well ! It is now publique, &amp; you
wil stand for your priviledges wee know : to read, and censure.
Do so, but buy it first. That doth best commend a Booke, the
Stationer saies. Then, how odde soever your braines be, or your
wisedomes, make your licence the same, and spare not. Judge
your six-pen'orth, your shillings worth, your five shillings worth at
a time, or higher, so you rise to the just rates, and welcome. But,
whatever you do, Buy. Censure will not drive a Trade, or make
the Jacke go. And though you be a Magistrate of wit, and sit on
the Stage at Black-Friers, or the Cock-pit, to arraigne Playes dailie,
know, these Playes have had their triall alreadie, and stood out all
Appeales ; and do now come forth quitted rather by a Decree of
Court, then any purchas'd Letters of commendation.</p><br>

<p id="id00086">It had bene a thing, we confesse, worthie to have bene wished, that
the Author himselfe had liv'd to have set forth, and overseen his
owne writings ; But since it hath bin ordain'd otherwise, and he by
death departed from that right, we pray you do not envie his
Friends, the office of their care, and paine, to have collected &amp;
publish'd them; and so to have publish'd them, as where (before)
you were abus'd with diverse stolne, and surreptitious copies,
maimed, and deformed by the frauds and stealthes of injurious
impostors, that expos'd them : even those, are now offer'd to your
view cur'd, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in
their numbers, as he conceived the'. Who, as he was a happie
imitator of Nature, was a most gentle expresser of it. His mind
and hand went together: And what he thought, he uttered with that
easinesse, that wee have scarse received from him a blot in his
papers. But it is not our province, who onely gather his works, and
give them you, to praise him. It is yours that reade him. And there
we hope, to your divers capacities, you will finde enough, both to
draw, and hold you : for his wit can no more lie hid, then it could
be lost. Reade him, therefore; and againe, and againe : And if then
you doe not like him, surely you are in some manifest danger, not
to understand him. And so we leave you to other of his Friends,
whom if you need, can bee your guides : if you neede them not,
you can leade your selves, and others. And such Readers we wish
him.</p><br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00096">To draw no envy (Shakespeare) on thy name,<br>

Am I thus ample to thy Booke, and Fame;<br>

While I confesse thy writings to be such,<br>

As neither Man, nor Muse, can praise too much.<br>

'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these wayes<br>

Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;<br>

For seeliest Ignorance on these may light,<br>

Which, when it sounds at best, but eccho's right;<br>

Or blinde Affection, which doth ne're advance<br>

The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;<br>

Or crafty Malice, might pretend this praise,<br>

And thine to ruine, where it seem'd to raise.<br>

These are, as some infamous Baud, or Whore,<br>

Should praise a Matron. What could hurt her more?<br>

But thou art proofe against them, and indeed<br>

Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.<br>

I, therefore will begin. Soule of the Age !<br>

The applause ! delight ! the wonder of our Stage !<br>

My Shakespeare, rise; I will not lodge thee by<br>

Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lye<br>

A little further, to make thee a roome :<br>

Thou art a Moniment, without a tombe,<br>

And art alive still, while thy Booke doth live,<br>

And we have wits to read, and praise to give.<br>

That I not mixe thee so, my braine excuses ;<br>

I meane with great, but disproportion'd Muses :<br>

For, if I thought my judgement were of yeeres,<br>

I should commit thee surely with thy peeres,<br>

And tell, how farre thou dist our Lily out-shine,<br>

Or sporting Kid or Marlowes mighty line.<br>

And though thou hadst small Latine, and lesse Greeke,<br>

From thence to honour thee, I would not seeke<br>

For names; but call forth thund'ring schilus,<br>

Euripides, and Sophocles to vs,<br>

Paccuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,<br>

To life againe, to heare thy Buskin tread,<br>

And shake a stage : Or, when thy sockes were on,<br>

Leave thee alone, for the comparison<br>

Of all, that insolent Greece, or haughtie Rome<br>

Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.<br>

Triumph, my Britaine, thou hast one to showe,<br>

To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.<br>

He was not of an age, but for all time !<br>

And all the Muses still were in their prime,<br>

When like Apollo he came forth to warme<br>

Our eares, or like a Mercury to charme !<br>

Nature her selfe was proud of his designes,<br>

And joy'd to weare the dressing of his lines !<br>

Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,<br>

As, since, she will vouchsafe no other Wit.<br>

The merry Greeke, tart Aristophanes,<br>

Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not<br>

please;But antiquated, and deserted lye<br>

As they were not of Natures family.<br>

Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,<br>

My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part;<br>

For though the Poets matter, Nature be,<br>

His Art doth give the fashion. And, that he,<br>

Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,<br>

(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat<br>

Upon the Muses anvile : turne the same,<br>

(And himselfe with it) that he thinkes to frame;<br>

Or for the lawrell, he may gaine a scorne,<br>

For a good Poet's made, as well as borne.<br>

And such wert thou. Looke how the fathers face<br>

Lives in his issue, even so, the race<br>

Of Shakespeares minde, and manners brightly shines<br>

In his well toned, and true-filed lines :<br>

In each of which, he seemes to shake a Lance,<br>

As brandish't at the eyes of Ignorance.<br>

Sweet swan of Avon! what a fight it were<br>

To see thee in our waters yet appeare,<br>

And make those flights upon the bankes of Thames,<br>

That so did take Eliza, and our James !<br>

But stay, I see thee in the Hemisphere<br>

Advanc'd, and made a Constellation there !<br>

Shine forth, thou Starre of Poets, and with rage,<br>

Or influence, chide, or cheere the drooping Stage;<br>

Which, since thy flight fro' hence, hath mourn'd like night,<br>

And despaires day, but for thy Volumes light.<br>

I pray thee marke me, that a brother should<br>

Be so perfidious: he, whom next thy selfe<br>

Of all the world I lou'd, and to him put<br>

The mannage of my state, as at that time<br>

Through all the signories it was the first,<br>

And Prospero, the prime Duke, being so reputed<br>

In dignity; and for the liberall Artes,<br>

Without a paralell; those being all my studie,<br>

Awak'd an euill nature, and my trust<br>

A falsehood in it's contrarie, as great<br>

As my trust was, which had indeede no limit,<br>

A confidence sans bound. He being thus Lorded,<br>

Not onely with what my reuenew yeelded,<br>

But what my power might els exact. Like one<br>

Who hauing into truth, by telling of it,<br>

Made such a synner of his memorie<br>

To credite his owne lie, he did beleeue<br>

He was indeed the Duke, out o'th' Substitution<br>

And executing th' outward face of Roialtie<br>

With all prerogatiue: hence his Ambition growing:<br>

Do'st thou heare ?<br>

This King of Naples being an Enemy<br>

To me inueterate, hearkens my Brothers suit,<br>

Which was, That he in lieu o'th' premises,<br>

Of homage, and I know not how much Tribute,<br>

Should presently extirpate me and mine<br>

Out of the Dukedome, and confer faire Millaine<br>

With all the Honors, on my brother: Whereon<br>

A treacherous Armie leuied, one mid-night<br>

Fated to th' purpose, did Anthonio open<br>

The gates of Millaine, and ith' dead of darkenesse<br>

The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence<br>

Me, and thy crying selfe<br>

That howre destroy vs?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00188">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Well demanded, wench:<br>

My Tale prouokes that question: Deare, they durst not,<br>

So deare the loue my people bore me: nor set<br>

A marke so bloudy on the businesse; but<br>

With colours fairer, painted their foule ends.<br>

In few, they hurried vs aboord a Barke,<br>

Bore vs some Leagues to Sea, where they prepared<br>

A rotten carkasse of a Butt, not rigg'd,<br>

Nor tackle, sayle, nor mast, the very rats<br>

Instinctiuely haue quit it: There they hoyst vs<br>

To cry to th' Sea, that roard to vs; to sigh<br>

To th' windes, whose pitty sighing backe againe<br>

Did vs but louing wrong<br>

Was I then to you?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00190">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. O, a Cherubin<br>

Thou was't that did preserue me; Thou didst smile,<br>

Infused with a fortitude from heauen,<br>

When I haue deck'd the sea with drops full salt,<br>

Vnder my burthen groan'd, which rais'd in me<br>

An vndergoing stomacke, to beare vp<br>

Against what should ensue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00191"> Mir. How came we a shore?</p><br>

<p id="id00192">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. By prouidence diuine,<br>

Some food, we had, and some fresh water, that<br>

A noble Neopolitan Gonzalo<br>

Out of his Charity, (who being then appointed<br>

Master of this designe) did giue vs, with<br>

Rich garments, linnens, stuffs, and necessaries<br>

Which since haue steeded much, so of his gentlenesse<br>

Knowing I lou'd my bookes, he furnishd me<br>

From mine owne Library, with volumes, that<br>

I prize aboue my Dukedome<br>

<p id="id00193">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir. Would I might<br>

But euer see that man<br>

<p id="id00194">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Now I arise,<br>

Sit still, and heare the last of our sea-sorrow:<br>

Heere in this Iland we arriu'd, and heere<br>

Haue I, thy Schoolemaster, made thee more profit<br>

Then other Princesse can, that haue more time<br>

For vainer howres; and Tutors, not so carefull<br>

For still 'tis beating in my minde; your reason<br>

For raysing this Sea-storme?<br>

<p id="id00196">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Know thus far forth,<br>

By accident most strange, bountifull Fortune<br>

(Now my deere Lady) hath mine enemies<br>

Brought to this shore: And by my prescience<br>

I finde my Zenith doth depend vpon<br>

A most auspitious starre, whose influence<br>

If now I court not, but omit; my fortunes<br>

Will euer after droope: Heare cease more questions,<br>

Thou art inclinde to sleepe: 'tis a good dulnesse,<br>

And giue it way: I know thou canst not chuse:<br>

Come away, Seruant, come; I am ready now,<br>

Approach my Ariel. Come.<br>

<p id="id00198">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ari. All haile, great Master, graue Sir, haile: I come<br>

To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,<br>

To swim, to diue into the fire: to ride<br>

On the curld clowds: to thy strong bidding, taske<br>

Ariel, and all his Qualitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00199">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Hast thou, Spirit,<br>

Performd to point, the Tempest that I bad thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00200">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. To euery Article.<br>

I boorded the Kings ship: now on the Beake,<br>

Now in the Waste, the Decke, in euery Cabyn,<br>

I flam'd amazement, sometime I'ld diuide<br>

And burne in many places; on the Top-mast,<br>

The Yards and Bore-spritt, would I flame distinctly,<br>

Then meete, and ioyne. Ioues Lightning, the precursers<br>

O'th dreadfull Thunder-claps more momentarie<br>

And sight out-running were not; the fire, and cracks<br>

Of sulphurous roaring, the most mighty Neptune<br>

Seeme to besiege, and make his bold waues tremble,<br>

Yea, his dread Trident shake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00201">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. My braue Spirit,<br>

Who was so firme, so constant, that this coyle<br>

Would not infect his reason?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00202">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Not a soule<br>

But felt a Feauer of the madde, and plaid<br>

Some tricks of desperation; all but Mariners<br>

Plung'd in the foaming bryne, and quit the vessell;<br>

Then all a fire with me the Kings sonne Ferdinand<br>

With haire vp-staring (then like reeds, not haire)<br>

Was the first man that leapt; cride hell is empty,<br>

And all the Diuels are heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00203">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Why that's my spirit:<br>

But was not this nye shore?<br>

<p id="id00204"> Ar. Close by, my Master</p><br>

<p id="id00205"> Pro. But are they (Ariell) safe?</p><br>

<p id="id00206">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Not a haire perishd:<br>

On their sustaining garments not a blemish,<br>

But fresher then before: and as thou badst me,<br>

In troops I haue dispersd them 'bout the Isle:<br>

The Kings sonne haue I landed by himselfe,<br>

Whom I left cooling of the Ayre with sighes,<br>

In an odde Angle of the Isle, and sitting<br>

His armes in this sad knot<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00207">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Of the Kings ship,<br>

The Marriners, say how thou hast disposd,<br>

And all the rest o'th' Fleete?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00208">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Safely in harbour<br>

Is the Kings shippe, in the deepe Nooke, where once<br>

Thou calldst me vp at midnight to fetch dewe<br>

From the still-vext Bermoothes, there she's hid;<br>

The Marriners all vnder hatches stowed,<br>

Who, with a Charme ioynd to their suffred labour<br>

I haue left asleep: and for the rest o'th' Fleet<br>

(Which I dispers'd) they all haue met againe,<br>

And are vpon the Mediterranian Flote<br>

Bound sadly home for Naples,<br>

Supposing that they saw the Kings ship wrackt,<br>

And his great person perish<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00209">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Ariel, thy charge<br>

Exactly is perform'd; but there's more worke:<br>

What is the time o'th' day?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00210"> Ar. Past the mid season</p><br>

<p id="id00211">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. At least two Glasses: the time 'twixt six &amp; now<br>

Must by vs both be spent most preciously<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00212">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Is there more toyle? Since y dost giue me pains,<br>

Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd,<br>

Which is not yet perform'd me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00213">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. How now? moodie?<br>

What is't thou canst demand?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00214"> Ar. My Libertie</p><br>

<p id="id00215"> Pro. Before the time be out? no more:</p><br>

<p id="id00216">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. I prethee,<br>

Remember I haue done thee worthy seruice,<br>

Told thee no lyes, made thee no mistakings, serv'd<br>

Without or grudge, or grumblings; thou did promise<br>

To bate me a full yeere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00217">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Do'st thou forget<br>

From what a torment I did free thee?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00218"> Ar. No</p><br>

<p id="id00219">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Thou do'st: &amp; thinkst it much to tread y Ooze<br>

Of the salt deepe;<br>

To run vpon the sharpe winde of the North,<br>

To doe me businesse in the veines o'th' earth<br>

When it is bak'd with frost<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00220"> Ar. I doe not Sir</p><br>

<p id="id00221">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Thou liest, malignant Thing: hast thou forgot<br>

The fowle Witch Sycorax, who with Age and Enuy<br>

Was growne into a hoope? hast thou forgot her?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00222"> Ar. No Sir</p><br>

<p id="id00223"> Pro. Thou hast: where was she born? speak: tell me:</p><br>

<p id="id00224"> Ar. Sir, in Argier</p><br>

<p id="id00225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Oh, was she so: I must<br>

Once in a moneth recount what thou hast bin,<br>

Which thou forgetst. This damn'd Witch Sycorax<br>

For mischiefes manifold, and sorceries terrible<br>

To enter humane hearing, from Argier<br>

Thou know'st was banish'd: for one thing she did<br>

They wold not take her life: Is not this true?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00226"> Ar. I, Sir</p><br>

<p id="id00227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. This blew ey'd hag, was hither brought with child,<br>

And here was left by th' Saylors; thou my slaue,<br>

As thou reportst thy selfe, was then her seruant,<br>

And for thou wast a Spirit too delicate<br>

To act her earthy, and abhord commands,<br>

Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee<br>

By helpe of her more potent Ministers,<br>

And in her most vnmittigable rage,<br>

Into a clouen Pyne, within which rift<br>

Imprison'd, thou didst painefully remaine<br>

A dozen yeeres: within which space she di'd,<br>

And left thee there: where thou didst vent thy groanes<br>

As fast as Mill-wheeles strike: Then was this Island<br>

(Saue for the Son, that he did littour heere,<br>

A frekelld whelpe, hag-borne) not honour'd with<br>

A humane shape<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00228"> Ar. Yes: Caliban her sonne</p><br>

<p id="id00229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Dull thing, I say so: he, that Caliban<br>

Whom now I keepe in seruice, thou best know'st<br>

What torment I did finde thee in; thy grones<br>

Did make wolues howle, and penetrate the breasts<br>

Of euer-angry Beares; it was a torment<br>

To lay vpon the damn'd, which Sycorax<br>

Could not againe vndoe: it was mine Art,<br>

When I arriu'd, and heard thee, that made gape<br>

The Pyne, and let thee out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00230"> Ar. I thanke thee Master</p><br>

<p id="id00231">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an Oake<br>

And peg-thee in his knotty entrailes, till<br>

Thou hast howl'd away twelue winters<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00232">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Pardon, Master,<br>

I will be correspondent to command<br>

And doe my spryting, gently<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00233">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Doe so: and after two daies<br>

I will discharge thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. That's my noble Master:<br>

What shall I doe? say what? what shall I doe?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00235">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Goe make thy selfe like a Nymph o'th' Sea,<br>

Be subiect to no sight but thine, and mine: inuisible<br>

To euery eye-ball else: goe take this shape<br>

And hither come in't: goe: hence<br>

With diligence.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00236">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id00237">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Awake, deere hart awake, thou hast slept well,<br>

Awake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00238">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir. The strangenes of your story, put<br>

Heauinesse in me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Shake it off: Come on,<br>

Wee'll visit Caliban, my slaue, who neuer<br>

Yeelds vs kinde answere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00240"> Mir. 'Tis a villaine Sir, I doe not loue to looke on</p><br>

<p id="id00241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. But as 'tis<br>

We cannot misse him: he do's make our fire,<br>

Fetch in our wood, and serues in Offices<br>

That profit vs: What hoa: slaue: Caliban:<br>

Thou Earth, thou: speake<br>

<p id="id00242"> Cal. within. There's wood enough within</p><br>

<p id="id00243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Come forth I say, there's other busines for thee:<br>

Come thou Tortoys, when?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00244">Enter Ariel like a water Nymph.</p><br>

<p id="id00245">Fine apparision: my queint Ariel,<br>

Hearke in thine eare<br>

<p id="id00246"> Ar. My Lord, it shall be done.</p><br>

<p id="id00247">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id00248">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Thou poysonous slaue, got by y diuell himselfe<br>

Vpon thy wicked Dam; come forth.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00249" style="margin-top: 2em">Enter Caliban.</p><br>

<p id="id00250">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal. As wicked dewe, as ere my mother brush'd<br>

With Rauens feather from vnwholesome Fen<br>

Drop on you both: A Southwest blow on yee,<br>

And blister you all ore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00251">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. For this be sure, to night thou shalt haue cramps,<br>

Side-stitches, that shall pen thy breath vp, Vrchins<br>

Shall for that vast of night, that they may worke<br>

All exercise on thee: thou shalt be pinch'd<br>

As thicke as hony-combe, each pinch more stinging<br>

Then Bees that made 'em<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00252">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal. I must eat my dinner:<br>

This Island's mine by Sycorax my mother,<br>

Which thou tak'st from me: when thou cam'st first<br>

Thou stroakst me, &amp; made much of me: wouldst giue me<br>

Water with berries in't: and teach me how<br>

To name the bigger Light, and how the lesse<br>

That burne by day, and night: and then I lou'd thee<br>

And shew'd thee all the qualities o'th' Isle,<br>

The fresh Springs, Brine-pits; barren place and fertill,<br>

Curs'd be I that did so: All the Charmes<br>

Of Sycorax: Toades, Beetles, Batts light on you:<br>

For I am all the Subiects that you haue,<br>

Which first was min owne King: and here you sty-me<br>

In this hard Rocke, whiles you doe keepe from me<br>

The rest o'th' Island<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00253">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Thou most lying slaue,<br>

Whom stripes may moue, not kindnes: I haue vs'd thee<br>

(Filth as thou art) with humane care, and lodg'd thee<br>

In mine owne Cell, till thou didst seeke to violate<br>

The honor of my childe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00254">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal. Oh ho, oh ho, would't had bene done:<br>

Thou didst preuent me, I had peopel'd else<br>

This Isle with Calibans<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00255">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mira. Abhorred Slaue,<br>

Which any print of goodnesse wilt not take,<br>

Being capable of all ill: I pittied thee,<br>

Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each houre<br>

One thing or other: when thou didst not (Sauage)<br>

Know thine owne meaning; but wouldst gabble, like<br>

A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes<br>

With words that made them knowne: But thy vild race<br>

(Tho thou didst learn) had that in't, which good natures<br>

Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou<br>

Deseruedly confin'd into this Rocke, who hadst<br>

Deseru'd more then a prison<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal. You taught me Language, and my profit on't<br>

Is, I know how to curse: the red-plague rid you<br>

For learning me your language<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00257">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros. Hag-seed, hence:<br>

Fetch vs in Fewell, and be quicke thou'rt best<br>

To answer other businesse: shrug'st thou (Malice)<br>

If thou neglectst, or dost vnwillingly<br>

What I command, Ile racke thee with old Crampes,<br>

Fill all thy bones with Aches, make thee rore,<br>

That beasts shall tremble at thy dyn<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00258">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal. No, 'pray thee.<br>

I must obey, his Art is of such pow'r,<br>

It would controll my Dams god Setebos,<br>

And make a vassaile of him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00259"> Pro. So slaue, hence.</p><br>

<p id="id00260">Exit Cal.</p><br>

<p id="id00261">Enter Ferdinand &amp; Ariel, inuisible playing &amp; singing.</p><br>

Curtsied when you haue, and kist the wilde waues whist:<br>

Foote it featly heere, and there, and sweete Sprights beare<br>

cry cockadidle-dowe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00266">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. Where shold this Musick be? I'th aire, or th' earth?<br>

It sounds no more: and sure it waytes vpon<br>

Some God o'th' Iland, sitting on a banke,<br>

Weeping againe the King my Fathers wracke.<br>

This Musicke crept by me vpon the waters,<br>

Allaying both their fury, and my passion<br>

With it's sweet ayre: thence I haue follow'd it<br>

(Or it hath drawne me rather) but 'tis gone.<br>

No, it begins againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00267">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariell Song. Full fadom fiue thy Father lies,<br>

Of his bones are Corrall made:<br>

Those are pearles that were his eies,<br>

Nothing of him that doth fade,<br>

But doth suffer a Sea-change<br>

Into something rich, &amp; strange:<br>

Sea-Nimphs hourly ring his knell.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00268">Burthen: ding dong.<br>

Harke now I heare them, ding-dong bell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00269">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. The Ditty do's remember my drown'd father,<br>

This is no mortall busines, nor no sound<br>

That the earth owes: I heare it now aboue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00270">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. The fringed Curtaines of thine eye aduance,<br>

And say what thou see'st yond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00271">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mira. What is't a Spirit?<br>

Lord, how it lookes about: Beleeue me sir,<br>

It carries a braue forme. But 'tis a spirit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00272">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. No wench, it eats, and sleeps, &amp; hath such senses<br>

As we haue: such. This Gallant which thou seest<br>

Was in the wracke: and but hee's something stain'd<br>

With greefe (that's beauties canker) y might'st call him<br>

A goodly person: he hath lost his fellowes,<br>

And strayes about to finde 'em<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00273">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir. I might call him<br>

A thing diuine, for nothing naturall<br>

I euer saw so Noble<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00274">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. It goes on I see<br>

As my soule prompts it: Spirit, fine spirit, Ile free thee<br>

Within two dayes for this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00275">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. Most sure the Goddesse<br>

On whom these ayres attend: Vouchsafe my pray'r<br>

May know if you remaine vpon this Island,<br>

And that you will some good instruction giue<br>

How I may beare me heere: my prime request<br>

(Which I do last pronounce) is (O you wonder)<br>

If you be Mayd, or no?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00276">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir. No wonder Sir,<br>

But certainly a Mayd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00277">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. My Language? Heauens:<br>

I am the best of them that speake this speech,<br>

Were I but where 'tis spoken<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00278">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. How? the best?<br>

What wer't thou if the King of Naples heard thee?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00279">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders<br>

To heare thee speake of Naples: he do's heare me,<br>

And that he do's, I weepe: my selfe am Naples,<br>

Who, with mine eyes (neuer since at ebbe) beheld<br>

The King my Father wrack't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00280"> Mir. Alacke, for mercy</p><br>

<p id="id00281">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. Yes faith, &amp; all his Lords, the Duke of Millaine<br>

And his braue sonne, being twaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00282">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. The Duke of Millaine<br>

And his more brauer daughter, could controll thee<br>

If now 'twere fit to do't: At the first sight<br>

They haue chang'd eyes: Delicate Ariel,<br>

Ile set thee free for this. A word good Sir,<br>

I feare you haue done your selfe some wrong: A word<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00283">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir. Why speakes my father so vngently? This<br>

Is the third man that ere I saw: the first<br>

That ere I sigh'd for: pitty moue my father<br>

To be enclin'd my way<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00284">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. O, if a Virgin,<br>

And your affection not gone forth, Ile make you<br>

The Queene of Naples<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00285">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Soft sir, one word more.<br>

They are both in eythers pow'rs: But this swift busines<br>

I must vneasie make, least too light winning<br>

Make the prize light. One word more: I charge thee<br>

That thou attend me: Thou do'st heere vsurpe<br>

The name thou ow'st not, and hast put thy selfe<br>

Vpon this Island, as a spy, to win it<br>

From me, the Lord on't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00286"> Fer. No, as I am a man</p><br>

<p id="id00287">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir. Ther's nothing ill, can dwell in such a Temple,<br>

If the ill-spirit haue so fayre a house,<br>

Good things will striue to dwell with't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00288"> Pro. Follow me</p><br>

<p id="id00289">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros. Speake not you for him: hee's a Traitor: come,<br>

Ile manacle thy necke and feete together:<br>

Sea water shalt thou drinke: thy food shall be<br>

The fresh-brooke Mussels, wither'd roots, and huskes<br>

Wherein the Acorne cradled. Follow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00290">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. No,<br>

I will resist such entertainment, till<br>

Mine enemy ha's more pow'r.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00291">He drawes, and is charmed from mouing.</p><br>

<p id="id00292">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mira. O deere Father,<br>

Make not too rash a triall of him, for<br>

Hee's gentle, and not fearfull<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00293">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros. What I say,<br>

My foote my Tutor? Put thy sword vp Traitor,<br>

Who mak'st a shew, but dar'st not strike: thy conscience<br>

Is so possest with guilt: Come, from thy ward,<br>

For I can heere disarme thee with this sticke,<br>

And make thy weapon drop<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00294"> Mira. Beseech you Father</p><br>

<p id="id00295"> Pros. Hence: hang not on my garments</p><br>

Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee: What,<br>

An aduocate for an Impostor? Hush:<br>

Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,<br>

(Hauing seene but him and Caliban:) Foolish wench,<br>

To th' most of men, this is a Caliban,<br>

And they to him are Angels<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00298">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mira. My affections<br>

Are then most humble: I haue no ambition<br>

To see a goodlier man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00299">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros. Come on, obey:<br>

Thy Nerues are in their infancy againe.<br>

And haue no vigour in them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. So they are:<br>

My spirits, as in a dreame, are all bound vp:<br>

My Fathers losse, the weaknesse which I feele,<br>

The wracke of all my friends, nor this mans threats,<br>

To whom I am subdude, are but light to me,<br>

Might I but through my prison once a day<br>

Behold this Mayd: all corners else o'th' Earth<br>

Let liberty make vse of: space enough<br>

Haue I in such a prison<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00301">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros. It workes: Come on.<br>

Thou hast done well, fine Ariell: follow me,<br>

Harke what thou else shalt do mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00302">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mira. Be of comfort,<br>

My Fathers of a better nature (Sir)<br>

Then he appeares by speech: this is vnwonted<br>

Which now came from him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00303">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros. Thou shalt be as free<br>

As mountaine windes; but then exactly do<br>

All points of my command<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00304"> Ariell. To th' syllable</p><br>

Is much beyond our losse; our hint of woe<br>

Is common, euery day, some Saylors wife,<br>

The Masters of some Merchant, and the Merchant<br>

Haue iust our Theame of woe: But for the miracle,<br>

(I meane our preseruation) few in millions<br>

Can speake like vs: then wisely (good Sir) weigh<br>

Our sorrow, with our comfort<br>

<p id="id00349"> Seb. With an eye of greene in't</p><br>

<p id="id00350"> Ant. He misses not much</p><br>

<p id="id00351"> Seb. No: he doth but mistake the truth totally</p><br>

<p id="id00352" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Gon. But the rariety of it is, which is indeed almost
beyond credit</p><br>

<p id="id00353"> Seb. As many voucht rarieties are</p><br>

<p id="id00354"> Gon. That our Garments being (as they were) drencht
in the Sea, hold notwithstanding their freshnesse and
glosses, being rather new dy'de then stain'd with salte
water</p><br>

<p id="id00355">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. If but one of his pockets could speake, would<br>

it not say he lyes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I, or very falsely pocket vp his report<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00356"> Gon. Me thinkes our garments are now as fresh as
when we put them on first in Affricke, at the marriage
of the kings faire daughter Claribel to the king of Tunis</p><br>

<p id="id00357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in<br>

our returne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00358">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. Tunis was neuer grac'd before with such a Paragon<br>

to their Queene<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00359"> Gon. Not since widdow Dido's time</p><br>

<p id="id00360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Widow? A pox o'that: how came that Widdow<br>

in? Widdow Dido!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00361">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. What if he had said Widdower aeneas too?<br>

Good Lord, how you take it?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00362">&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. Widdow Dido said you? You make me study<br>

of that: She was of Carthage, not of Tunis<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00363"> Gon. This Tunis Sir was Carthage</p><br>

<p id="id00364"> Adri. Carthage?</p><br>

<p id="id00365"> Gon. I assure you Carthage</p><br>

<p id="id00366"> Ant. His word is more then the miraculous Harpe</p><br>

<p id="id00367"> Seb. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too</p><br>

<p id="id00368"> Ant. What impossible matter wil he make easy next?</p><br>

<p id="id00369">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I thinke hee will carry this Island home in his<br>

pocket, and giue it his sonne for an Apple<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00370">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. And sowing the kernels of it in the Sea, bring<br>

forth more Islands<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00371"> Gon. I</p><br>

<p id="id00372"> Ant. Why in good time</p><br>

<p id="id00373"> Gon. Sir, we were talking, that our garments seeme
now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now Queene</p><br>

<p id="id00374"> Ant. And the rarest that ere came there</p><br>

<p id="id00375"> Seb. Bate (I beseech you) widdow Dido</p><br>

<p id="id00376"> Ant. O Widdow Dido? I, Widdow Dido</p><br>

<p id="id00377" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Gon. Is not Sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I meane in a sort</p><br>

<p id="id00378"> Ant. That sort was well fish'd for</p><br>

<p id="id00379"> Gon. When I wore it at your daughters marriage</p><br>

<p id="id00380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alon. You cram these words into mine eares, against<br>

the stomacke of my sense: would I had neuer<br>

Married my daughter there: For comming thence<br>

My sonne is lost, and (in my rate) she too,<br>

Who is so farre from Italy remoued,<br>

I ne're againe shall see her: O thou mine heire<br>

Of Naples and of Millaine, what strange fish<br>

Hath made his meale on thee?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00381">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran. Sir he may liue,<br>

I saw him beate the surges vnder him,<br>

And ride vpon their backes; he trod the water<br>

Whose enmity he flung aside: and brested<br>

The surge most swolne that met him: his bold head<br>

'Boue the contentious waues he kept, and oared<br>

Himselfe with his good armes in lusty stroke<br>

To th' shore; that ore his waue-worne basis bowed<br>

As stooping to releeue him: I not doubt<br>

He came aliue to Land<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00382"> Alon. No, no, hee's gone</p><br>

<p id="id00383">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Sir you may thank your selfe for this great losse,<br>

That would not blesse our Europe with your daughter,<br>

But rather loose her to an Affrican,<br>

Where she at least, is banish'd from your eye,<br>

Who hath cause to wet the greefe on't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00384"> Alon. Pre-thee peace</p><br>

<p id="id00385">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. You were kneel'd too, &amp; importun'd otherwise<br>

By all of vs: and the faire soule her selfe<br>

Waigh'd betweene loathnesse, and obedience, at<br>

Which end o'th' beame should bow: we haue lost your son,<br>

I feare for euer: Millaine and Naples haue<br>

Mo widdowes in them of this businesse making,<br>

Then we bring men to comfort them:<br>

The faults your owne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00386"> Alon. So is the deer'st oth' losse</p><br>

<p id="id00387">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. My Lord Sebastian,<br>

The truth you speake doth lacke some gentlenesse,<br>

And time to speake it in: you rub the sore,<br>

When you should bring the plaister<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00388"> Seb. Very well</p><br>

<p id="id00389"> Ant. And most Chirurgeonly</p><br>

<p id="id00390">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. It is foule weather in vs all, good Sir,<br>

When you are cloudy<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00391"> Seb. Fowle weather?</p><br>

<p id="id00392"> Ant. Very foule</p><br>

<p id="id00393"> Gon. Had I plantation of this Isle my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id00394"> Ant. Hee'd sow't with Nettle-seed</p><br>

<p id="id00395"> Seb. Or dockes, or Mallowes</p><br>

<p id="id00396"> Gon. And were the King on't, what would I do?</p><br>

<p id="id00397"> Seb. Scape being drunke, for want of Wine</p><br>

<p id="id00398">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. I'th' Commonwealth I would (by contraries)<br>

Execute all things: For no kinde of Trafficke<br>

Would I admit: No name of Magistrate:<br>

Letters should not be knowne: Riches, pouerty,<br>

And vse of seruice, none: Contract, Succession,<br>

Borne, bound of Land, Tilth, Vineyard none:<br>

No vse of Mettall, Corne, or Wine, or Oyle:<br>

No occupation, all men idle, all:<br>

And Women too, but innocent and pure:<br>

No Soueraignty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00399"> Seb. Yet he would be King on't</p><br>

<p id="id00400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. The latter end of his Common-wealth forgets<br>

the beginning<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00401">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. All things in common Nature should produce<br>

Without sweat or endeuour: Treason, fellony,<br>

Sword, Pike, Knife, Gun, or neede of any Engine<br>

Would I not haue: but Nature should bring forth<br>

Of it owne kinde, all foyzon, all abundance<br>

To feed my innocent people<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00402"> Seb. No marrying 'mong his subiects?</p><br>

<p id="id00403"> Ant. None (man) all idle; Whores and knaues,</p><br>

<p id="id00404">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. I would with such perfection gouerne Sir:<br>

T' Excell the Golden Age<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00405"> Seb. 'Saue his Maiesty</p><br>

<p id="id00406"> Ant. Long liue Gonzalo</p><br>

<p id="id00407"> Gon. And do you marke me, Sir?</p><br>

<p id="id00408"> Alon. Pre-thee no more: thou dost talke nothing to me</p><br>

<p id="id00409"> Gon. I do well beleeue your Highnesse, and did it
to minister occasion to these Gentlemen, who are of
such sensible and nimble Lungs, that they alwayes vse
to laugh at nothing</p><br>

<p id="id00410"> Ant. 'Twas you we laugh'd at</p><br>

<p id="id00411" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Gon. Who, in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still</p><br>

<p id="id00412"> Ant. What a blow was there giuen?</p><br>

<p id="id00413"> Seb. And it had not falne flat-long</p><br>

<p id="id00414"> Gon. You are Gentlemen of braue mettal: you would
lift the Moone out of her spheare, if she would continue
in it fiue weekes without changing.</p><br>

<p id="id00415">Enter Ariell playing solemne Musicke.</p><br>

<p id="id00416"> Seb. We would so, and then go a Bat-fowling</p><br>

<p id="id00417"> Ant. Nay good my Lord, be not angry</p><br>

<p id="id00418"> Gon. No I warrant you, I will not aduenture my
discretion so weakly: Will you laugh me asleepe, for I
am very heauy</p><br>

<p id="id00419"> Ant. Go sleepe, and heare vs</p><br>

<p id="id00420">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alon. What, all so soone asleepe? I wish mine eyes<br>

Would (with themselues) shut vp my thoughts,<br>

I finde they are inclin'd to do so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00421">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Please you Sir,<br>

Do not omit the heauy offer of it:<br>

It sildome visits sorrow, when it doth, it is a Comforter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00422">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. We two my Lord, will guard your person,<br>

While you take your rest, and watch your safety<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00423"> Alon. Thanke you: Wondrous heauy</p><br>

<p id="id00424"> Seb. What a strange drowsines possesses them?</p><br>

<p id="id00425"> Ant. It is the quality o'th' Clymate</p><br>

<p id="id00426">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Why<br>

Doth it not then our eye-lids sinke? I finde<br>

Not my selfe dispos'd to sleep<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00427">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Nor I, my spirits are nimble:<br>

They fell together all, as by consent<br>

They dropt, as by a Thunder-stroke: what might<br>

Worthy Sebastian? O, what might? no more:<br>

And yet, me thinkes I see it in thy face,<br>

What thou should'st be: th' occasion speaks thee, and<br>

My strong imagination see's a Crowne<br>

Dropping vpon thy head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00428"> Seb. What? art thou waking?</p><br>

<p id="id00429"> Ant. Do you not heare me speake?</p><br>

<p id="id00430">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I do, and surely<br>

It is a sleepy Language; and thou speak'st<br>

Out of thy sleepe: What is it thou didst say?<br>

This is a strange repose, to be asleepe<br>

With eyes wide open: standing, speaking, mouing:<br>

And yet so fast asleepe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00431">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Noble Sebastian,<br>

Thou let'st thy fortune sleepe: die rather: wink'st<br>

Whiles thou art waking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00432">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Thou do'st snore distinctly,<br>

There's meaning in thy snores<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00433">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I am more serious then my custome: you<br>

Must be so too, if heed me: which to do,<br>

Trebbles thee o're<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00434"> Seb. Well: I am standing water</p><br>

<p id="id00435"> Ant. Ile teach you how to flow</p><br>

<p id="id00436">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Do so: to ebbe<br>

Hereditary Sloth instructs me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00437">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. O!<br>

If you but knew how you the purpose cherish<br>

Whiles thus you mocke it: how in stripping it<br>

You more inuest it: ebbing men, indeed<br>

(Most often) do so neere the bottome run<br>

By their owne feare, or sloth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00438">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. 'Pre-thee say on,<br>

The setting of thine eye, and cheeke proclaime<br>

A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,<br>

Which throwes thee much to yeeld<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00439">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Thus Sir:<br>

Although this Lord of weake remembrance; this<br>

Who shall be of as little memory<br>

When he is earth'd, hath here almost perswaded<br>

(For hee's a Spirit of perswasion, onely<br>

Professes to perswade) the King his sonne's aliue,<br>

'Tis as impossible that hee's vndrown'd,<br>

As he that sleepes heere, swims<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00440">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I haue no hope<br>

That hee's vndrown'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00441">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. O, out of that no hope,<br>

What great hope haue you? No hope that way, Is<br>

Another way so high a hope, that euen<br>

Ambition cannot pierce a winke beyond<br>

But doubt discouery there. Will you grant with me<br>

That Ferdinand is drown'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00442"> Seb. He's gone</p><br>

<p id="id00443"> Ant. Then tell me, who's the next heire of Naples?</p><br>

<p id="id00444"> Seb. Claribell</p><br>

<p id="id00445">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. She that is Queene of Tunis: she that dwels<br>

Ten leagues beyond mans life: she that from Naples<br>

Can haue no note, vnlesse the Sun were post:<br>

The Man i'th Moone's too slow, till new-borne chinnes<br>

Be rough, and Razor-able: She that from whom<br>

We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast againe,<br>

(And by that destiny) to performe an act<br>

Whereof, what's past is Prologue; what to come<br>

In yours, and my discharge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00446">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. What stuffe is this? How say you?<br>

'Tis true my brothers daughter's Queene of Tunis,<br>

So is she heyre of Naples, 'twixt which Regions<br>

There is some space<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00447">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. A space, whose eu'ry cubit<br>

Seemes to cry out, how shall that Claribell<br>

Measure vs backe to Naples? keepe in Tunis,<br>

And let Sebastian wake. Say, this were death<br>

That now hath seiz'd them, why they were no worse<br>

Then now they are: There be that can rule Naples<br>

As well as he that sleepes: Lords, that can prate<br>

As amply, and vnnecessarily<br>

As this Gonzallo: I my selfe could make<br>

A Chough of as deepe chat: O, that you bore<br>

The minde that I do; what a sleepe were this<br>

For your aduancement? Do you vnderstand me?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00448"> Seb. Me thinkes I do</p><br>

<p id="id00449">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. And how do's your content<br>

Tender your owne good fortune?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00450">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I remember<br>

You did supplant your Brother Prospero<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00451">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. True:<br>

And looke how well my Garments sit vpon me,<br>

Much feater then before: My Brothers seruants<br>

Were then my fellowes, now they are my men<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00452"> Seb. But for your conscience</p><br>

<p id="id00453">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I Sir: where lies that? If 'twere a kybe<br>

'Twould put me to my slipper: But I feele not<br>

This Deity in my bosome: 'Twentie consciences<br>

That stand 'twixt me, and Millaine, candied be they,<br>

And melt ere they mollest: Heere lies your Brother,<br>

No better then the earth he lies vpon,<br>

If he were that which now hee's like (that's dead)<br>

Whom I with this obedient steele (three inches of it)<br>

Can lay to bed for euer: whiles you doing thus,<br>

To the perpetuall winke for aye might put<br>

This ancient morsell: this Sir Prudence, who<br>

Should not vpbraid our course: for all the rest<br>

They'l take suggestion, as a Cat laps milke,<br>

They'l tell the clocke, to any businesse that<br>

We say befits the houre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00454">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Thy case, deere Friend<br>

Shall be my president: As thou got'st Millaine,<br>

I'le come by Naples: Draw thy sword, one stroke<br>

Shall free thee from the tribute which thou paiest,<br>

And I the King shall loue thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00455">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Draw together:<br>

And when I reare my hand, do you the like<br>

To fall it on Gonzalo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00456"> Seb. O, but one word.</p><br>

<p id="id00457">Enter Ariell with Musicke and Song.</p><br>

<p id="id00458">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariel. My Master through his Art foresees the danger<br>

That you (his friend) are in, and sends me forth<br>

(For else his proiect dies) to keepe them liuing.<br>

<p id="id00459">Sings in Gonzaloes eare.</p><br>

<p id="id00460">While you here do snoaring lie,<br>

Open-ey'd Conspiracie<br>

If of Life you keepe a care,<br>

Shake off slumber and beware.<br>

Awake, awake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00461"> Ant. Then let vs both be sodaine</p><br>

<p id="id00462"> Gon. Now, good Angels preserue the King</p><br>

<p id="id00463">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alo. Why how now hoa; awake? why are you drawn?<br>

Wherefore this ghastly looking?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00464"> Gon. What's the matter?</p><br>

<p id="id00465">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,<br>

(Euen now) we heard a hollow burst of bellowing<br>

Like Buls, or rather Lyons, did't not wake you?<br>

It strooke mine eare most terribly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00466"> Alo. I heard nothing</p><br>

<p id="id00467">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. O, 'twas a din to fright a Monsters eare;<br>

To make an earthquake: sure it was the roare<br>

Of a whole heard of Lyons<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00468"> Alo. Heard you this Gonzalo?</p><br>

<p id="id00469">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. Vpon mine honour, Sir, I heard a humming,<br>

(And that a strange one too) which did awake me:<br>

I shak'd you Sir, and cride: as mine eyes opend,<br>

I saw their weapons drawne: there was a noyse,<br>

That's verily: 'tis best we stand vpon our guard;<br>

Or that we quit this place: let's draw our weapons<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00470">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alo. Lead off this ground &amp; let's make further search<br>

For my poore sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00471">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. Heauens keepe him from these Beasts:<br>

For he is sure i'th Island<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00472"> Alo. Lead away</p><br>

<p id="id00473">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariell. Prospero my Lord, shall know what I haue done.<br>

So (King) goe safely on to seeke thy Son.<br>

or a fish? dead or aliue? a fish, hee smels like a fish: a
very ancient and fish-like smell: a kinde of, not of the

now (as once I was) and had but this fish painted; not
a holiday-foole there but would giue a peece of siluer:
there, would this Monster, make a man: any strange
beast there, makes a man: when they will not giue a

a dead Indian: Leg'd like a man; and his Finnes like
Armes: warme o'my troth: I doe now let loose my opinion;

<p id="id00490"> Ste. This is some Monster of the Isle, with foure legs;
who hath got (as I take it) an Ague: where the diuell
should he learne our language? I will giue him some reliefe
if it be but for that: if I can recouer him, and keepe
him tame, and get to Naples with him, he's a Present
for any Emperour that euer trod on Neates-leather</p><br>

too much for him; hee shall pay for him that hath him,
and that soundly</p><br>

<p id="id00496"> Ste. Foure legges and two voyces; a most delicate
Monster: his forward voyce now is to speake well of

poure some in thy other mouth</p><br>

Would be as heauy to me, as odious, but<br>

The Mistris which I serue, quickens what's dead,<br>

Ten times more gentle, then her Father's crabbed;<br>

And he's compos'd of harshnesse. I must remoue<br>

Hauing first seiz'd his bookes: Or with a logge<br>

Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,<br>

Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember<br>

First to possesse his Bookes; for without them<br>

Hee's but a Sot, as I am; nor hath not<br>

As rootedly as I. Burne but his Bookes,<br>

He ha's braue Vtensils (for so he calles them)<br>

Which when he ha's a house, hee'l decke withall.<br>

And that most deeply to consider, is<br>

Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well<br>

Wound the loud windes, or with bemockt-at-Stabs<br>

Kill the still closing waters, as diminish<br>

One dowle that's in my plumbe: My fellow ministers<br>

Are like-invulnerable: if you could hurt,<br>

Your swords are now too massie for your strengths,<br>

And will not be vplifted: But remember<br>

(For that's my businesse to you) that you three<br>

From Millaine did supplant good Prospero,<br>

Me thought the billowes spoke, and told me of it,<br>

The windes did sing it to me: and the Thunder<br>

(That deepe and dreadfull Organ-Pipe) pronounc'd<br>

The solemne Temples, the great Globe it selfe,<br>

Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolue,<br>

And like this insubstantiall Pageant faded<br>

So full of valour, that they smote the ayre<br>

For breathing in their faces: beate the ground<br>

For kissing of their feete; yet alwaies bending<br>

Towards their proiect: then I beate my Tabor,<br>

At which like vnback't colts they prickt their eares,<br>

Aduanc'd their eye-lids, lifted vp their noses<br>

As they smelt musicke, so I charm'd their eares<br>

That Calfe-like, they my lowing follow'd, through<br>

Tooth'd briars, sharpe firzes, pricking gosse, &amp; thorns,<br>

Which entred their fraile shins: at last I left them<br>

Beats as of flesh, and blood: and since I saw thee,<br>

I feare a madnesse held me: this must craue<br>

My selfe were mudded in that oozie bed<br>

Where my sonne lies: when did you lose your daughter?<br>

<p id="id00800">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. In this last Tempest. I perceiue these Lords<br>

At this encounter doe so much admire,<br>

That they deuoure their reason, and scarce thinke<br>

Their eies doe offices of Truth: Their words<br>

Are naturall breath: but howsoeu'r you haue<br>

Beene iustled from your sences, know for certain<br>

That I am Prospero, and that very Duke<br>

Which was thrust forth of Millaine, who most strangely<br>

Vpon this shore (where you were wrackt) was landed<br>

To be the Lord on't: No more yet of this,<br>

For 'tis a Chronicle of day by day,<br>

Not a relation for a break-fast, nor<br>

Befitting this first meeting: Welcome, Sir;<br>

This Cell's my Court: heere haue I few attendants,<br>

And Subiects none abroad: pray you looke in:<br>

My Dukedome since you haue giuen me againe,<br>

I will requite you with as good a thing,<br>

Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three houres:<br>

Is she the goddesse that hath seuer'd vs,<br>

And brought vs thus together?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00812">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. Sir, she is mortall;<br>

But by immortall prouidence, she's mine;<br>

I chose her when I could not aske my Father<br>

For his aduise: nor thought I had one: She<br>

Is daughter to this famous Duke of Millaine,<br>

Of whom, so often I haue heard renowne,<br>

But neuer saw before: of whom I haue<br>

Receiu'd a second life; and second Father<br>

This Lady makes him to me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alo. I am hers.<br>

But O, how odly will it sound, that I<br>

Must aske my childe forgiuenesse?<br>

Let vs not burthen our remembrances, with<br>

A heauinesse that's gon<br>

<p id="id00815">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. I haue inly wept,<br>

Or should haue spoke ere this: looke downe you gods<br>

And on this couple drop a blessed crowne;<br>

For it is you, that haue chalk'd forth the way<br>

Which brought vs hither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00816"> Alo. I say Amen, Gonzallo</p><br>

<p id="id00817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gon. Was Millaine thrust from Millaine, that his Issue<br>

Should become Kings of Naples? O reioyce<br>

Beyond a common ioy, and set it downe<br>

With gold on lasting Pillers: In one voyage<br>

Did Claribell her husband finde at Tunis,<br>

And Ferdinand her brother, found a wife,<br>

Where he himselfe was lost: Prospero, his Dukedome<br>

In a poore Isle: and all of vs, our selues,<br>

When no man was his owne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alo. Giue me your hands:<br>

Let griefe and sorrow still embrace his heart,<br>

That doth not wish you ioy<br>

Hast thou no mouth by land?<br>

<p id="id00826">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. If I did thinke, Sir, I were well awake,<br>

I'ld striue to tell you: we were dead of sleepe,<br>

And (how we know not) all clapt vnder hatches,<br>

Where, but euen now, with strange, and seuerall noyses<br>

Of roring, shreeking, howling, gingling chaines,<br>

Where we, in all our trim, freshly beheld<br>

Our royall, good, and gallant Ship: our Master<br>

Capring to eye her: on a trice, so please you,<br>

What things are these, my Lord Anthonio?<br>

Will money buy em?<br>

<p id="id00836">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Very like: one of them<br>

Is a plaine Fish, and no doubt marketable<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00837">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Marke but the badges of these men, my Lords,<br>

Then say if they be true: This mishapen knaue;<br>

His Mother was a Witch, and one so strong<br>

That could controle the Moone; make flowes, and ebs,<br>

And deale in her command, without her power:<br>

These three haue robd me, and this demy-diuell;<br>

(For he's a bastard one) had plotted with them<br>

To take my life: two of these Fellowes, you<br>

Must know, and owne, this Thing of darkenesse, I<br>

Acknowledge mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00838"> Cal. I shall be pincht to death</p><br>

<p id="id00839"> Alo. Is not this Stephano, my drunken Butler?</p><br>

<p id="id00840">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. He is drunke now;<br>

Where had he wine?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00841">&nbsp;&nbsp;Alo. And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they<br>

Finde this grand Liquor that hath gilded 'em?<br>

How cam'st thou in this pickle?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00842">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tri. I haue bin in such a pickle since I saw you last,<br>

That I feare me will neuer out of my bones:<br>

I shall not feare fly-blowing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00843"> Seb. Why how now Stephano?</p><br>

<p id="id00844"> Ste. O touch me not, I am not Stephano, but a Cramp</p><br>

<p id="id00845"> Pro. You'ld be King o'the Isle, Sirha?</p><br>

<p id="id00846"> Ste. I should haue bin a sore one then</p><br>

<p id="id00847"> Alo. This is a strange thing as ere I look'd on</p><br>

<p id="id00848">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. He is as disproportion'd in his Manners<br>

As in his shape: Goe Sirha, to my Cell,<br>

Take with you your Companions: as you looke<br>

To haue my pardon, trim it handsomely<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00849">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal. I that I will: and Ile be wise hereafter,<br>

And seeke for grace: what a thrice double Asse<br>

Was I to take this drunkard for a god?<br>

And worship this dull foole?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00850"> Pro. Goe to, away</p><br>

<p id="id00851"> Alo. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it</p><br>

<p id="id00852"> Seb. Or stole it rather</p><br>

<p id="id00853">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Sir, I inuite your Highnesse, and your traine<br>

To my poore Cell: where you shall take your rest<br>

For this one night, which part of it, Ile waste<br>

With such discourse, as I not doubt, shall make it<br>

Goe quicke away: The story of my life,<br>

And the particular accidents, gon by<br>

Since I came to this Isle: And in the morne<br>

I'le bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,<br>

Where I haue hope to see the nuptiall<br>

Of these our deere-belou'd, solemnized,<br>

And thence retire me to my Millaine, where<br>

Euery third thought shall be my graue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00854">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alo. I long<br>

To heare the story of your life; which must<br>

Take the eare strangely<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00855">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I'le deliuer all,<br>

And promise you calme Seas, auspicious gales,<br>

And saile, so expeditious, that shall catch<br>

Your Royall fleete farre off: My Ariel; chicke<br>

That is thy charge: Then to the Elements<br>

Be free, and fare thou well: please you draw neere.<br>

<p id="id00866">Valentine: Protheus, and Speed.</p><br>

<p id="id00867">&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentine. Cease to perswade, my louing Protheus;<br>

Home-keeping youth, haue euer homely wits,<br>

Wer't not affection chaines thy tender dayes<br>

To the sweet glaunces of thy honour'd Loue,<br>

I rather would entreat thy company,<br>

To see the wonders of the world abroad,<br>

Then (liuing dully sluggardiz'd at home)<br>

Weare out thy youth with shapelesse idlenesse.<br>

But since thou lou'st; loue still, and thriue therein,<br>

Euen as I would, when I to loue begin<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00868">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine adew,<br>

Thinke on thy Protheus, when thou (hap'ly) seest<br>

Some rare note-worthy obiect in thy trauaile.<br>

Wish me partaker in thy happinesse,<br>

When thou do'st meet good hap; and in thy danger,<br>

(If euer danger doe enuiron thee)<br>

Commend thy grieuance to my holy prayers,<br>

For I will be thy beades-man, Valentine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00869"> Val. And on a loue-booke pray for my successe?</p><br>

<p id="id00870"> Pro. Vpon some booke I loue, I'le pray for thee</p><br>

<p id="id00871">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. That's on some shallow Storie of deepe loue,<br>

How yong Leander crost the Hellespont<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00872">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. That's a deepe Storie, of a deeper loue,<br>

For he was more then ouer-shooes in loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00873">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. 'Tis true; for you are ouer-bootes in loue,<br>

And yet you neuer swom the Hellespont<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00874"> Pro. Ouer the Bootes? nay giue me not the Boots</p><br>

<p id="id00875"> Val. No, I will not; for it boots thee not</p><br>

<p id="id00876"> Pro. What?</p><br>

<p id="id00877">&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. To be in loue; where scorne is bought with grones:<br>

Coy looks, with hart-sore sighes: one fading moments mirth,<br>

With twenty watchfull, weary, tedious nights;<br>

If hap'ly won, perhaps a haplesse gaine;<br>

If lost, why then a grieuous labour won;<br>

How euer: but a folly bought with wit,<br>

Or else a wit, by folly vanquished<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00878"> Pro. So, by your circumstance, you call me foole</p><br>

<p id="id00879"> Val. So, by your circumstance, I feare you'll proue</p><br>

<p id="id00880"> Pro. 'Tis Loue you cauill at, I am not Loue</p><br>

<p id="id00881">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Loue is your master, for he masters you;<br>

And he that is so yoked by a foole,<br>

Me thinkes should not be chronicled for wise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00882">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Yet Writers say; as in the sweetest Bud,<br>

The eating Canker dwels; so eating Loue<br>

Inhabits in the finest wits of all<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00883">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. And Writers say; as the most forward Bud<br>

Is eaten by the Canker ere it blow,<br>

Euen so by Loue, the yong, and tender wit<br>

Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the Bud,<br>

Loosing his verdure, euen in the prime,<br>

And all the faire effects of future hopes.<br>

But wherefore waste I time to counsaile thee<br>

That art a votary to fond desire?<br>

Once more adieu: my Father at the Road<br>

Expects my comming, there to see me ship'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00884"> Pro. And thither will I bring thee Valentine</p><br>

<p id="id00885">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Sweet Protheus, no: Now let vs take our leaue:<br>

To Millaine let me heare from thee by Letters<br>

Of thy successe in loue; and what newes else<br>

Betideth here in absence of thy Friend:<br>

And I likewise will visite thee with mine<br>

<p id="id00888">Enter</p><br>

<p id="id00889">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. He after Honour hunts, I after Loue;<br>

He leaues his friends, to dignifie them more;<br>

I loue my selfe, my friends, and all for loue:<br>

Thou Iulia, thou hast metamorphis'd me:<br>

Made me neglect my Studies, loose my time;<br>

Warre with good counsaile; set the world at nought;<br>

Made Wit with musing, weake; hart sick with thought<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00890"> Sp. Sir Protheus: 'saue you: saw you my Master?</p><br>

<p id="id00891"> Pro. But now he parted hence to embarque for Millain</p><br>

<p id="id00892">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Twenty to one then, he is ship'd already,<br>

And I haue plaid the Sheepe in loosing him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00893">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Indeede a Sheepe doth very often stray,<br>

And if the Shepheard be awhile away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00894">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. You conclude that my Master is a Shepheard then,<br>

and I Sheepe?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00895"> Pro. I doe</p><br>

<p id="id00896" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Sp. Why then my hornes are his hornes, whether I
wake or sleepe</p><br>

<p id="id00897"> Pro. A silly answere, and fitting well a Sheepe</p><br>

<p id="id00898"> Sp. This proues me still a Sheepe</p><br>

<p id="id00899"> Pro. True: and thy Master a Shepheard</p><br>

<p id="id00900"> Sp. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance</p><br>

<p id="id00901"> Pro. It shall goe hard but ile proue it by another</p><br>

<p id="id00902">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. The Shepheard seekes the Sheepe, and not the<br>

Sheepe the Shepheard; but I seeke my Master, and my<br>

Master seekes not me: therefore I am no Sheepe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00903"> Pro. The Sheepe for fodder follow the Shepheard,
the Shepheard for foode followes not the Sheepe: thou
for wages followest thy Master, thy Master for wages
followes not thee: therefore thou art a Sheepe</p><br>

<p id="id00904"> Sp. Such another proofe will make me cry baa</p><br>

<p id="id00905" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pro. But do'st thou heare: gau'st thou my Letter
to Iulia?</p><br>

<p id="id00906"> Sp. I Sir: I (a lost-Mutton) gaue your Letter to her
(a lac'd-Mutton) and she (a lac'd-Mutton) gaue mee (a
lost-Mutton) nothing for my labour</p><br>

<p id="id00907">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Here's too small a Pasture for such store of<br>

Muttons<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00908">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. If the ground be ouer-charg'd, you were best<br>

sticke her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00909">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound<br>

you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00910">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Nay Sir, lesse then a pound shall serue me for carrying<br>

your Letter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00911"> Pro. You mistake; I meane the pound, a Pinfold</p><br>

<p id="id00912">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. From a pound to a pin? fold it ouer and ouer,<br>

'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your louer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00913"> Pro. But what said she?</p><br>

<p id="id00914"> Sp. I</p><br>

<p id="id00915"> Pro. Nod-I, why that's noddy</p><br>

<p id="id00916">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. You mistooke Sir: I say she did nod;<br>

And you aske me if she did nod, and I say I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00917"> Pro. And that set together is noddy</p><br>

<p id="id00918" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Sp. Now you haue taken the paines to set it together,
take it for your paines</p><br>

<p id="id00919"> Pro. No, no, you shall haue it for bearing the letter</p><br>

<p id="id00920"> Sp. Well, I perceiue I must be faine to beare with you</p><br>

<p id="id00921"> Pro. Why Sir, how doe you beare with me?</p><br>

<p id="id00922">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Marry Sir, the letter very orderly,<br>

Hauing nothing but the word noddy for my paines<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00923"> Pro. Beshrew me, but you haue a quicke wit</p><br>

<p id="id00924"> Sp. And yet it cannot ouer-take your slow purse</p><br>

<p id="id00925">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Come, come, open the matter in briefe; what<br>

said she<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00926">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Open your purse, that the money, and the matter<br>

may be both at once deliuered<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00927"> Pro. Well Sir: here is for your paines: what said she?</p><br>

<p id="id00928"> Sp. Truely Sir, I thinke you'll hardly win her</p><br>

<p id="id00929"> Pro. Why? could'st thou perceiue so much from her?</p><br>

<p id="id00930">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Sir, I could perceiue nothing at all from her;<br>

No, not so much as a ducket for deliuering your letter:<br>

And being so hard to me, that brought your minde;<br>

I feare she'll proue as hard to you in telling your minde.<br>

Giue her no token but stones, for she's as hard as steele<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00931"> Pro. What said she, nothing?</p><br>

<p id="id00932">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. No, not so much as take this for thy pains:<br>

To testifie your bounty, I thank you, you haue cestern'd me;<br>

In requital whereof, henceforth, carry your letters your<br>

selfe; And so Sir, I'le commend you to my Master<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00933">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Go, go, be gone, to saue your Ship from wrack,<br>

Which cannot perish hauing thee aboarde,<br>

Being destin'd to a drier death on shore:<br>

I must goe send some better Messenger,<br>

I feare my Iulia would not daigne my lines,<br>

Receiuing them from such a worthlesse post.<br>

<p id="id00938"> Luc. I Madam, so you stumble not vnheedfully</p><br>

That euery day with par'le encounter me,<br>

In thy opinion which is worthiest loue?<br>

<p id="id00940">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Please you repeat their names, ile shew my minde,<br>

According to my shallow simple skill<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00941">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. What thinkst thou of the faire sir Eglamoure?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. As of a Knight, well-spoken, neat, and fine;<br>

But were I you, he neuer should be mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00942">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Well of his wealth; but of himselfe, so, so<br>

<p id="id00943">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. What think'st thou of the gentle Protheus?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Lord, Lord: to see what folly raignes in vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00944">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. How now? what meanes this passion at his name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Pardon deare Madam, 'tis a passing shame,<br>

That I (vnworthy body as I am)<br>

Should censure thus on louely Gentlemen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00945">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. Why not on Protheus, as of all the rest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Then thus: of many good, I thinke him best<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00946">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Your reason?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. I haue no other but a womans reason:<br>

I thinke him so, because I thinke him so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00947">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. And would'st thou haue me cast my loue on him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. I: if you thought your loue not cast away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00948"> Iul. Why he, of all the rest, hath neuer mou'd me</p><br>

<p id="id00949"> Lu. Yet he, of all the rest, I thinke best loues ye</p><br>

<p id="id00950"> Iul. His little speaking, shewes his loue but small</p><br>

<p id="id00951"> Lu. Fire that's closest kept, burnes most of all</p><br>

<p id="id00952"> Iul. They doe not loue, that doe not shew their loue</p><br>

<p id="id00957">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Say, say: who gaue it thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Sir Valentines page: &amp; sent I think from Protheus;<br>

He would haue giuen it you, but I being in the way,<br>

Did in your name receiue it: pardon the fault I pray<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00958">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Now (by my modesty) a goodly Broker:<br>

Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?<br>

To whisper, and conspire against my youth?<br>

Now trust me, 'tis an office of great worth,<br>

And you an officer fit for the place:<br>

There: take the paper: see it be return'd,<br>

Or else returne no more into my sight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00959"> Lu. To plead for loue, deserues more fee, then hate</p><br>

<p id="id00960">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Will ye be gon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. That you may ruminate.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00961">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id00962">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. And yet I would I had ore-look'd the Letter;<br>

It were a shame to call her backe againe,<br>

And pray her to a fault, for which I chid her.<br>

What 'foole is she, that knowes I am a Maid,<br>

And would not force the letter to my view?<br>

Since Maides, in modesty, say no, to that,<br>

Which they would haue the profferer construe, I.<br>

Fie, fie: how way-ward is this foolish loue;<br>

That (like a testie Babe) will scratch the Nurse,<br>

And presently, all humbled kisse the Rod?<br>

How churlishly, I chid Lucetta hence,<br>

When willingly, I would haue had her here?<br>

How angerly I taught my brow to frowne,<br>

When inward ioy enforc'd my heart to smile?<br>

My pennance is, to call Lucetta backe<br>

And aske remission, for my folly past.<br>

What hoe: Lucetta<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00963">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. What would your Ladiship?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Is't neere dinner time?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. I would it were,<br>

That you might kill your stomacke on your meat,<br>

And not vpon your Maid<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00964">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. What is't that you<br>

Tooke vp so gingerly?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Nothing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00965">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. Why didst thou stoope then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. To take a paper vp, that I let fall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00966">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. And is that paper nothing?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Nothing concerning me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00967"> Iul. Then let it lye, for those that it concernes</p><br>

<p id="id00968">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Madam, it will not lye where it concernes,<br>

Vnlesse it haue a false Interpreter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00969"> Iul. Some loue of yours, hath writ to you in Rime</p><br>

Giue me a Note, your Ladiship can set<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. As little by such toyes, as may be possible:<br>

Best sing it to the tune of Light O, Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00971"> Lu. It is too heauy for so light a tune</p><br>

<p id="id00972">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. Heauy? belike it hath some burden then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. I: and melodious were it, would you sing it,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. And why not you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. I cannot reach so high<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00973">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. Let's see your Song:<br>

How now Minion?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Keepe tune there still; so you will sing it out:<br>

And yet me thinkes I do not like this tune<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00974">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. You doe not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. No (Madam) tis too sharpe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00975"> Iu. You (Minion) are too saucie</p><br>

<p id="id00976">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Nay, now you are too flat;<br>

And marre the concord, with too harsh a descant:<br>

There wanteth but a Meane to fill your Song<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00977"> Iu. The meane is dround with you vnruly base</p><br>

<p id="id00978"> Lu. Indeede I bid the base for Protheus</p><br>

<p id="id00979">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me;<br>

Here is a coile with protestation:<br>

Goe, get you gone: and let the papers lye:<br>

You would be fingring them, to anger me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00980">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. She makes it stra[n]ge, but she would be best pleas'd<br>

To be so angred with another Letter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00981">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. Nay, would I were so angred with the same:<br>

Oh hatefull hands, to teare such louing words;<br>

Iniurious Waspes, to feede on such sweet hony,<br>

And kill the Bees that yeelde it, with your stings;<br>

Ile kisse each seuerall paper, for amends:<br>

Looke, here is writ, kinde Iulia: vnkinde Iulia,<br>

As in reuenge of thy ingratitude,<br>

I throw thy name against the bruzing-stones,<br>

Trampling contemptuously on thy disdaine.<br>

And here is writ, Loue wounded Protheus.<br>

Poore wounded name: my bosome, as a bed,<br>

Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;<br>

And thus I search it with a soueraigne kisse.<br>

But twice, or thrice, was Protheus written downe:<br>

Be calme (good winde) blow not a word away,<br>

Till I haue found each letter, in the Letter,<br>

Except mine own name: That, some whirle-winde beare<br>

Vnto a ragged, fearefull, hanging Rocke,<br>

And throw it thence into the raging Sea.<br>

Loe, here in one line is his name twice writ:<br>

Poore forlorne Protheus, passionate Protheus:<br>

To the sweet Iulia: that ile teare away:<br>

And yet I will not, sith so prettily<br>

He couples it, to his complaining Names;<br>

Thus will I fold them, one vpon another;<br>

Now kisse, embrace, contend, doe what you will<br>

<p id="id00982"> Lu. Madam: dinner is ready: and your father staies</p><br>

<p id="id00983"> Iu. Well, let vs goe</p><br>

<p id="id00984">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. What, shall these papers lye, like Tel-tales here?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. If you respect them; best to take them vp<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00985">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu. Nay, I was taken vp, for laying them downe.<br>

Yet here they shall not lye, for catching cold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00986"> Iu. I see you haue a months minde to them</p><br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00993">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Why? what of him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan. He wondred that your Lordship<br>

Would suffer him, to spend his youth at home,<br>

While other men, of slender reputation<br>

Put forth their Sonnes, to seeke preferment out.<br>

Some to the warres, to try their fortune there;<br>

Some, to discouer Islands farre away:<br>

Some, to the studious Vniuersities;<br>

For any, or for all these exercises,<br>

He said, that Protheus, your sonne, was meet;<br>

And did request me, to importune you<br>

To let him spend his time no more at home;<br>

Which would be great impeachment to his age,<br>

In hauing knowne no trauaile in his youth<br>

<p id="id00994">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Nor need'st thou much importune me to that<br>

Whereon, this month I haue bin hamering.<br>

I haue consider'd well, his losse of time,<br>

And how he cannot be a perfect man,<br>

Not being tryed, and tutord in the world:<br>

And perfected by the swift course of time:<br>

Then tell me, whether were I best to send him?<br>

Attends the Emperour in his royall Court<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. May't please your Lordship, 'tis a word or two<br>

Of commendations sent from Valentine;<br>

Deliuer'd by a friend, that came from him<br>

<p id="id01003"> Ant. Lend me the Letter: Let me see what newes</p><br>

And daily graced by the Emperor;<br>

Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01005">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. And how stand you affected to his wish?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. As one relying on your Lordships will,<br>

And not depending on his friendly wish<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01006">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. My will is something sorted with his wish:<br>

Muse not that I thus sodainly proceed;<br>

For what I will, I will, and there an end:<br>

With Valentinus, in the Emperors Court:<br>

Come on Panthino; you shall be imployd,<br>

To hasten on his Expedition<br>

<p id="id01009">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Thus haue I shund the fire, for feare of burning,<br>

And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.<br>

I fear'd to shew my Father Iulias Letter,<br>

Least he should take exceptions to my loue,<br>

And with the vantage of mine owne excuse<br>

Hath he excepted most against my loue.<br>

Oh, how this spring of loue resembleth<br>

The vncertaine glory of an Aprill day,<br>

Which now shewes all the beauty of the Sun,<br>

And by and by a clowd takes all away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01014">Enter Valentine, Speed, Siluia</p><br>

<p id="id01015"> Speed. Sir, your Gloue</p><br>

<p id="id01016"> Valen. Not mine: my Gloues are on</p><br>

<p id="id01017"> Sp. Why then this may be yours: for this is but one</p><br>

<p id="id01018">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Ha? Let me see: I, giue it me, it's mine:<br>

Sweet Ornament, that deckes a thing diuine,<br>

Ah Siluia, Siluia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01019"> Speed. Madam Siluia: Madam Siluia</p><br>

<p id="id01020">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How now Sirha?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Shee is not within hearing Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01021">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Why sir, who bad you call her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Your worship sir, or else I mistooke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01022"> Val. Well: you'll still be too forward</p><br>

<p id="id01023"> Speed. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow</p><br>

<p id="id01024"> Val. Goe to, sir, tell me: do you know Madam Siluia?
 Speed. Shee that your worship loues?
 Val. Why, how know you that I am in loue?
 Speed. Marry by these speciall markes: first, you haue
learn'd (like Sir Protheus) to wreath your Armes like a
Male-content: to rellish a Loue-song, like a Robin-redbreast:
to walke alone like one that had the pestilence:
to sigh, like a Schoole-boy that had lost his A.B.C. to
weep like a yong wench that had buried her Grandam:
to fast, like one that takes diet: to watch, like one that
feares robbing: to speake puling, like a beggar at Hallow-Masse:
You were wont, when you laughed, to crow
like a cocke; when you walk'd, to walke like one of the
Lions: when you fasted, it was presently after dinner:
when you look'd sadly, it was for want of money: And
now you are Metamorphis'd with a Mistris, that when I
looke on you, I can hardly thinke you my Master</p><br>

<p id="id01025">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Are all these things perceiu'd in me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. They are all perceiu'd without ye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01026"> Val. Without me? they cannot</p><br>

<p id="id01027"> Speed. Without you? nay, that's certaine: for without
you were so simple, none else would: but you are
so without these follies, that these follies are within you,
and shine through you like the water in an Vrinall: that
not an eye that sees you, but is a Physician to comment
on your Malady</p><br>

<p id="id01028">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. But tell me: do'st thou know my Lady Siluia?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Shee that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Hast thou obseru'd that? euen she I meane<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01029"> Speed. Why sir, I know her not</p><br>

<p id="id01030">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Do'st thou know her by my gazing on her, and<br>

yet know'st her not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Is she not hard-fauour'd, sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Not so faire (boy) as well fauour'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01031"> Speed. Sir, I know that well enough</p><br>

<p id="id01032">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. What dost thou know?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. That shee is not so faire, as (of you) well-fauourd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I meane that her beauty is exquisite,<br>

But her fauour infinite<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01033">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. That's because the one is painted, and the other<br>

out of all count<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01034">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How painted? and how out of count?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Marry sir, so painted to make her faire, that no<br>

man counts of her beauty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01035"> Val. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty</p><br>

<p id="id01036"> Speed. You neuer saw her since she was deform'd</p><br>

<p id="id01037">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How long hath she beene deform'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Euer since you lou'd her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01038">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I haue lou'd her euer since I saw her,<br>

And still I see her beautifull<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01039"> Speed. If you loue her, you cannot see her</p><br>

<p id="id01040">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Why?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Because Loue is blinde: O that you had mine<br>

eyes, or your owne eyes had the lights they were wont<br>

to haue, when you chidde at Sir Protheus, for going vngarter'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01041"> Val. What should I see then?
 Speed. Your owne present folly, and her passing deformitie:
for hee beeing in loue, could not see to garter
his hose; and you, beeing in loue, cannot see to put on
your hose</p><br>

<p id="id01042">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Belike (boy) then you are in loue, for last morning<br>

You could not see to wipe my shooes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01043"> Speed. True sir: I was in loue with my bed, I thanke
you, you swing'd me for my loue, which makes mee the
bolder to chide you, for yours</p><br>

<p id="id01044"> Val. In conclusion, I stand affected to her</p><br>

<p id="id01045">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. I would you were set, so your affection would<br>

cease<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01046">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Last night she enioyn'd me,<br>

To write some lines to one she loues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01047">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. And haue you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I haue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01048">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Are they not lamely writt?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No (Boy) but as well as I can do them:<br>

Peace, here she comes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01049">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Oh excellent motion; oh exceeding Puppet:<br>

Now will he interpret to her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01050"> Val. Madam &amp; Mistres, a thousand good-morrows</p><br>

<p id="id01051" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Speed. Oh, 'giue ye-good-ev'n: heer's a million of
manners</p><br>

<p id="id01052"> Sil. Sir Valentine, and seruant, to you two thousand</p><br>

<p id="id01053"> Speed. He should giue her interest: &amp; she giues it him</p><br>

<p id="id01054">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. As you inioynd me; I haue writ your Letter<br>

Vnto the secret, nameles friend of yours:<br>

Which I was much vnwilling to proceed in,<br>

But for my duty to your Ladiship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01055"> Sil. I thanke you (gentle Seruant) 'tis very Clerklydone</p><br>

<p id="id01056">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Now trust me (Madam) it came hardly-off:<br>

For being ignorant to whom it goes,<br>

I writ at randome, very doubtfully<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01057">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No (Madam) so it steed you, I will write<br>

(Please you command) a thousand times as much:<br>

And yet -<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. A pretty period: well: I ghesse the sequell;<br>

And yet I will not name it: and yet I care not.<br>

And yet, take this againe: and yet I thanke you:<br>

Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01058"> Speed. And yet you will: and yet, another yet</p><br>

<p id="id01059">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. What meanes your Ladiship?<br>

Doe you not like it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Yes, yes: the lines are very queintly writ,<br>

But (since vnwillingly) take them againe.<br>

Nay, take them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01060"> Val. Madam, they are for you</p><br>

<p id="id01061">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silu. I, I: you writ them Sir, at my request,<br>

But I will none of them: they are for you:<br>

I would haue had them writ more mouingly:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Please you, Ile write your Ladiship another<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01062">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. And when it's writ: for my sake read it ouer,<br>

And if it please you, so: if not: why so:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. If it please me, (Madam?) what then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Why if it please you, take it for your labour;<br>

And so good-morrow Seruant.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01063">Exit. Sil.</p><br>

<p id="id01064">&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Oh Iest vnseene: inscrutible: inuisible,<br>

As a nose on a mans face, or a Wethercocke on a steeple:<br>

My Master sues to her: and she hath taught her Sutor,<br>

He being her Pupill, to become her Tutor.<br>

Oh excellent deuise, was there euer heard a better?<br>

That my master being scribe,<br>

To himselfe should write the Letter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How now Sir?<br>

What are you reasoning with your selfe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Nay: I was riming: 'tis you y haue the reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01065">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. To doe what?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. To be a Spokes-man from Madam Siluia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. To whom?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. To your selfe: why, she woes you by a figure<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01067">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. What figure?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. By a Letter, I should say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01068">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Why she hath not writ to me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. What need she,<br>

When shee hath made you write to your selfe?<br>

Why, doe you not perceiue the iest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No, beleeue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01069">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. No beleeuing you indeed sir:<br>

But did you perceiue her earnest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. She gaue me none, except an angry word<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01070"> Speed. Why she hath giuen you a Letter</p><br>

<p id="id01071"> Val. That's the Letter I writ to her friend</p><br>

<p id="id01072"> Speed. And y letter hath she deliuer'd, &amp; there an end</p><br>

<p id="id01073"> Val. I would it were no worse</p><br>

<p id="id01074">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. Ile warrant you, 'tis as well:<br>

For often haue you writ to her: and she in modesty,<br>

Or else for want of idle time, could not againe reply,<br>

Or fearing els some messe[n]ger, y might her mind discouer<br>

Her self hath taught her Loue himself, to write vnto her louer.<br>

All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.<br>

Why muse you sir, 'tis dinner time<br>

for, looke you, she is as white as a lilly, and as
small as a wand: this hat is Nan our maid: I am the
dogge: no, the dogge is himselfe, and I am the dogge:
oh, the dogge is me, and I am my selfe: I; so, so: now
come I to my Father; Father, your blessing: now
should not the shooe speake a word for weeping:
now should I kisse my Father; well, hee weepes on:
Now come I to my Mother: Oh that she could speake
now, like a would-woman: well, I kisse her: why
there 'tis; heere's my mothers breath vp and downe:
Now come I to my sister; marke the moane she makes:
now the dogge all this while sheds not a teare: nor
speakes a word: but see how I lay the dust with my
teares</p><br>

<p id="id01092"> Panth. Launce, away, away: a Boord: thy Master is
ship'd, and thou art to post after with oares; what's the
matter? why weep'st thou man? away asse, you'l loose
the Tide, if you tarry any longer</p><br>

<p id="id01093">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laun. It is no matter if the tide were lost, for it is the<br>

in loosing the flood, loose thy voyage, and in loosing thy
voyage, loose thy Master, and in loosing thy Master,
loose thy seruice, and in loosing thy seruice: - why
dost thou stop my mouth?
 Laun. For feare thou shouldst loose thy tongue</p><br>

<p id="id01096">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panth. Where should I loose my tongue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Laun. In thy Tale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01097"> Panth. In thy Taile</p><br>

<p id="id01098"> Laun. Loose the Tide, and the voyage, and the Master,
and the Seruice, and the tide: why man, if the Riuer

were downe, I could driue the boate with my sighes</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Your selfe (sweet Lady) for you gaue the fire,<br>

Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your Ladiships lookes,<br>

And spends what he borrowes kindly in your company<br>

<p id="id01129">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thu. Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall<br>

make your wit bankrupt<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01130">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I know it well sir: you haue an Exchequer of words,<br>

And I thinke, no other treasure to giue your followers:<br>

For it appeares by their bare Liueries<br>

That they liue by your bare words<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01131">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. No more, gentlemen, no more:<br>

Here comes my father<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01132">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Now, daughter Siluia, you are hard beset.<br>

Sir Valentine, your father is in good health,<br>

What say you to a Letter from your friends<br>

Of much good newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. My Lord, I will be thankfull,<br>

To any happy messenger from thence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01133">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Know ye Don Antonio, your Countriman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I, my good Lord, I know the Gentleman<br>

To be of worth, and worthy estimation,<br>

And not without desert so well reputed<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01134">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Hath he not a Sonne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I, my good Lord, a Son, that well deserues<br>

The honor, and regard of such a father<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01135">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. You know him well?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I knew him as my selfe: for from our Infancie<br>

We haue conuerst, and spent our howres together,<br>

And though my selfe haue beene an idle Trewant,<br>

Omitting the sweet benefit of time<br>

To cloath mine age with Angel-like perfection:<br>

Yet hath Sir Protheus (for that's his name)<br>

Made vse, and faire aduantage of his daies:<br>

His yeares but yong, but his experience old:<br>

His head vn-mellowed, but his Iudgement ripe;<br>

And in a word (for far behinde his worth<br>

Comes all the praises that I now bestow.)<br>

He is compleat in feature, and in minde,<br>

With all good grace, to grace a Gentleman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01136">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Beshrew me sir, but if he make this good<br>

He is as worthy for an Empresse loue,<br>

As meet to be an Emperors Councellor:<br>

Well, Sir: this Gentleman is come to me<br>

With Commendation from great Potentates,<br>

And heere he meanes to spend his time a while,<br>

I thinke 'tis no vn-welcome newes to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01137"> Val. Should I haue wish'd a thing, it had beene he</p><br>

<p id="id01138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Welcome him then according to his worth:<br>

Siluia, I speake to you, and you Sir Thurio,<br>

For Valentine, I need not cite him to it,<br>

I will send him hither to you presently<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. This is the Gentleman I told your Ladiship<br>

Had come along with me, but that his Mistresse<br>

Did hold his eyes, lockt in her Christall lookes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Be-like that now she hath enfranchis'd them<br>

Vpon some other pawne for fealty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01141"> Val. Nay sure, I thinke she holds them prisoners stil</p><br>

<p id="id01142">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Nay then he should be blind, and being blind<br>

How could he see his way to seeke out you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Why Lady, Loue hath twenty paire of eyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01143"> Thur. They say that Loue hath not an eye at all</p><br>

<p id="id01144">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. To see such Louers, Thurio, as your selfe,<br>

Vpon a homely obiect, Loue can winke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01145"> Sil. Haue done, haue done: here comes y gentleman</p><br>

<p id="id01146">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Welcome, deer Protheus: Mistris, I beseech you<br>

Confirme his welcome, with some speciall fauor<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01147">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. His worth is warrant for his welcome hether,<br>

If this be he you oft haue wish'd to heare from<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01148">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Mistris, it is: sweet Lady, entertaine him<br>

To be my fellow-seruant to your Ladiship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01149"> Sil. Too low a Mistres for so high a seruant</p><br>

<p id="id01150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Not so, sweet Lady, but too meane a seruant<br>

To haue a looke of such a worthy a Mistresse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01151">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Leaue off discourse of disabilitie:<br>

Sweet Lady, entertaine him for your Seruant<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01152"> Pro. My dutie will I boast of, nothing else</p><br>

<p id="id01153">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. And dutie neuer yet did want his meed.<br>

Seruant, you are welcome to a worthlesse Mistresse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01154"> Pro. Ile die on him that saies so but your selfe</p><br>

<p id="id01155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. That you are welcome?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. That you are worthlesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01156"> Thur. Madam, my Lord your father wold speak with you</p><br>

<p id="id01157">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. I wait vpon his pleasure: Come Sir Thurio,<br>

Goe with me: once more, new Seruant welcome;<br>

Ile leaue you to confer of home affaires,<br>

When you haue done, we looke too heare from you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01158"> Pro. Wee'll both attend vpon your Ladiship</p><br>

<p id="id01159">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Now tell me: how do al from whence you came?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Your frends are wel, &amp; haue the[m] much co[m]mended<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. And how doe yours?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I left them all in health<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01161">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How does your Lady? &amp; how thriues your loue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. My tales of Loue were wont to weary you,<br>

I know you ioy not in a Loue-discourse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01162">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I Protheus, but that life is alter'd now,<br>

I haue done pennance for contemning Loue,<br>

Whose high emperious thoughts haue punish'd me<br>

With bitter fasts, with penitentiall grones,<br>

With nightly teares, and daily hart-sore sighes,<br>

For in reuenge of my contempt of loue,<br>

Loue hath chas'd sleepe from my enthralled eyes,<br>

And made them watchers of mine owne hearts sorrow.<br>

O gentle Protheus, Loue's a mighty Lord,<br>

And hath so humbled me, as I confesse<br>

There is no woe to his correction,<br>

Nor to his Seruice, no such ioy on earth:<br>

Now, no discourse, except it be of loue:<br>

Now can I breake my fast, dine, sup, and sleepe,<br>

Vpon the very naked name of Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01163">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye:<br>

Was this the Idoll, that you worship so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Euen She; and is she not a heauenly Saint?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. No; But she is an earthly Paragon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01164"> Val. Call her diuine</p><br>

<p id="id01165"> Pro. I will not flatter her</p><br>

<p id="id01166"> Val. O flatter me: for Loue delights in praises</p><br>

<p id="id01167">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. When I was sick, you gaue me bitter pils,<br>

And I must minister the like to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01168">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Then speake the truth by her; if not diuine,<br>

Yet let her be a principalitie,<br>

Soueraigne to all the Creatures on the earth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01169"> Pro. Except my Mistresse</p><br>

<p id="id01170">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Sweet: except not any,<br>

Except thou wilt except against my Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Haue I not reason to prefer mine owne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. And I will help thee to prefer her to:<br>

Shee shall be dignified with this high honour,<br>

To beare my Ladies traine, lest the base earth<br>

Should from her vesture chance to steale a kisse,<br>

And of so great a fauor growing proud,<br>

Disdaine to roote the Sommer-swelling flowre,<br>

And make rough winter euerlastingly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01172">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Why Valentine, what Bragadisme is this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Pardon me (Protheus) all I can is nothing,<br>

To her, whose worth, make other worthies nothing;<br>

Shee is alone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01173"> Pro. Then let her alone</p><br>

<p id="id01174">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Not for the world: why man, she is mine owne,<br>

And I as rich in hauing such a Iewell<br>

As twenty Seas, if all their sand were pearle,<br>

The water, Nectar, and the Rocks pure gold.<br>

Forgiue me, that I doe not dreame on thee,<br>

Because thou seest me doate vpon my loue:<br>

My foolish Riuall that her Father likes<br>

(Onely for his possessions are so huge)<br>

Is gone with her along, and I must after,<br>

For Loue (thou know'st is full of iealousie.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. But she loues you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I, and we are betroathd: nay more, our mariage howre,<br>

With all the cunning manner of our flight<br>

Determin'd of: how I must climbe her window,<br>

The Ladder made of Cords, and all the means<br>

Plotted, and 'greed on for my happinesse.<br>

Good Protheus goe with me to my chamber,<br>

In these affaires to aid me with thy counsaile<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01175">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Goe on before: I shall enquire you forth:<br>

I must vnto the Road, to dis-embarque<br>

Some necessaries, that I needs must vse,<br>

And then Ile presently attend you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01176"> Val. Will you make haste?</p><br>

<p id="id01177">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id01178">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I will.<br>

Euen as one heate, another heate expels,<br>

Or as one naile, by strength driues out another.<br>

So the remembrance of my former Loue<br>

Is by a newer obiect quite forgotten,<br>

It is mine, or Valentines praise?<br>

Her true perfection, or my false transgression?<br>

That makes me reasonlesse, to reason thus?<br>

Shee is faire: and so is Iulia that I loue,<br>

(That I did loue, for now my loue is thaw'd,<br>

Which like a waxen Image 'gainst a fire<br>

Beares no impression of the thing it was.)<br>

Me thinkes my zeale to Valentine is cold,<br>

And that I loue him not as I was wont:<br>

O, but I loue his Lady too-too much,<br>

And that's the reason I loue him so little.<br>

How shall I doate on her with more aduice,<br>

That thus without aduice begin to loue her?<br>

'Tis but her picture I haue yet beheld,<br>

And that hath dazel'd my reasons light:<br>

But when I looke on her perfections,<br>

There is no reason, but I shall be blinde.<br>

If I can checke my erring loue, I will,<br>

If not, to compasse her Ile vse my skill.<br>
</p><br>

If I loose them, thus finde I by their losse,<br>

For Valentine, my selfe: for Iulia, Siluia.<br>

<p id="id01210"> Luc. Alas, the way is wearisome and long</p><br>

<p id="id01211">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. A true-deuoted Pilgrime is not weary<br>

To measure Kingdomes with his feeble steps,<br>

Much lesse shall she that hath Loues wings to flie,<br>

And when the flight is made to one so deere,<br>

Of such diuine perfection as Sir Protheus<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01212"> Luc. Better forbeare, till Protheus make returne</p><br>

<p id="id01213">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Oh, know'st y not, his looks are my soules food?<br>

Pitty the dearth that I haue pined in,<br>

By longing for that food so long a time.<br>

Didst thou but know the inly touch of Loue,<br>

Thou wouldst as soone goe kindle fire with snow<br>

As seeke to quench the fire of Loue with words<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01214">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. I doe not seeke to quench your Loues hot fire,<br>

But qualifie the fires extreame rage,<br>

Lest it should burne aboue the bounds of reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01215">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. The more thou dam'st it vp, the more it burnes:<br>

The Current that with gentle murmure glides<br>

(Thou know'st) being stop'd, impatiently doth rage:<br>

But when his faire course is not hindered,<br>

He makes sweet musicke with th' enameld stones,<br>

Giuing a gentle kisse to euery sedge<br>

He ouer-taketh in his pilgrimage.<br>

And so by many winding nookes he straies<br>

With willing sport to the wilde Ocean.<br>

Then let me goe, and hinder not my course:<br>

Ile be as patient as a gentle streame,<br>

And make a pastime of each weary step,<br>

Till the last step haue brought me to my Loue,<br>

And there Ile rest, as after much turmoile<br>

A blessed soule doth in Elizium<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01216">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. But in what habit will you goe along?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Not like a woman, for I would preuent<br>

The loose encounters of lasciuious men:<br>

Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weedes<br>

As may beseeme some well reputed Page<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01217"> Luc. Why then your Ladiship must cut your haire</p><br>

<p id="id01218">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. No girle, Ile knit it vp in silken strings,<br>

With twentie od-conceited true-loue knots:<br>

To be fantastique, may become a youth<br>

Of greater time then I shall shew to be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01219">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. What fashion (Madam) shall I make your breeches?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. That fits as well, as tell me (good my Lord)<br>

What compasse will you weare your Farthingale?<br>

Why eu'n what fashion thou best likes (Lucetta.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. You must needs haue the[m] with a cod-peece Ma[dam]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Out, out, (Lucetta) that wilbe illfauourd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01220">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. A round hose (Madam) now's not worth a pin<br>

Vnlesse you haue a cod-peece to stick pins on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01221">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Lucetta, as thou lou'st me let me haue<br>

What thou think'st meet, and is most mannerly.<br>

But tell me (wench) how will the world repute me<br>

For vndertaking so vnstaid a iourney?<br>

I feare me it will make me scandaliz'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01222"> Luc. If you thinke so, then stay at home, and go not</p><br>

<p id="id01223"> Iul. Nay, that I will not</p><br>

<p id="id01224">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Then neuer dreame on Infamy, but go:<br>

If Protheus like your iourney, when you come,<br>

No matter who's displeas'd, when you are gone:<br>

I feare me he will scarce be pleas'd with all<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. That is the least (Lucetta) of my feare:<br>

A thousand oathes, an Ocean of his teares,<br>

And instances of infinite of Loue,<br>

Warrant me welcome to my Protheus<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01226"> Luc. All these are seruants to deceitfull men</p><br>

<p id="id01227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Base men, that vse them to so base effect;<br>

But truer starres did gouerne Protheus birth,<br>

His words are bonds, his oathes are oracles,<br>

His loue sincere, his thoughts immaculate,<br>

His teares, pure messengers, sent from his heart,<br>

His heart, as far from fraud, as heauen from earth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01228"> Luc. Pray heau'n he proue so when you come to him</p><br>

<p id="id01229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Now, as thou lou'st me, do him not that wrong,<br>

To beare a hard opinion of his truth:<br>

Onely deserue my loue, by louing him,<br>

And presently goe with me to my chamber<br>

To take a note of what I stand in need of,<br>

To furnish me vpon my longing iourney:<br>

All that is mine I leaue at thy dispose,<br>

My goods, my Lands, my reputation,<br>

Onely, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence:<br>

Come; answere not: but to it presently,<br>

I am impatient of my tarriance.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01230">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id01231" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Tertius, Scena Prima.</p><br>

<p id="id01232">Enter Duke, Thurio, Protheus, Valentine, Launce, Speed.</p><br>

<p id="id01233">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Sir Thurio, giue vs leaue (I pray) a while,<br>

We haue some secrets to confer about.<br>

Now tell me Protheus, what's your will with me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. My gracious Lord, that which I wold discouer,<br>

The Law of friendship bids me to conceale,<br>

But when I call to minde your gracious fauours<br>

Done to me (vndeseruing as I am)<br>

My dutie pricks me on to vtter that<br>

Which else, no worldly good should draw from me:<br>

Know (worthy Prince) Sir Valentine my friend<br>

This night intends to steale away your daughter:<br>

My selfe am one made priuy to the plot.<br>

I know you haue determin'd to bestow her<br>

On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,<br>

And should she thus be stolne away from you,<br>

It would be much vexation to your age.<br>

Thus (for my duties sake) I rather chose<br>

To crosse my friend in his intended drift,<br>

Then (by concealing it) heap on your head<br>

A pack of sorrowes, which would presse you downe<br>

(Being vnpreuented) to your timelesse graue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Protheus, I thank thee for thine honest care,<br>

Which to requite, command me while I liue.<br>

This loue of theirs, my selfe haue often seene,<br>

Haply when they haue iudg'd me fast asleepe,<br>

And oftentimes haue purpos'd to forbid<br>

Sir Valentine her companie, and my Court.<br>

But fearing lest my iealous ayme might erre,<br>

And so (vnworthily) disgrace the man<br>

(A rashnesse that I euer yet haue shun'd)<br>

I gaue him gentle lookes, thereby to finde<br>

That which thy selfe hast now disclos'd to me.<br>

And that thou maist perceiue my feare of this,<br>

Knowing that tender youth is soone suggested,<br>

I nightly lodge her in an vpper Towre,<br>

The key whereof, my selfe haue euer kept:<br>

And thence she cannot be conuay'd away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Know (noble Lord) they haue deuis'd a meane<br>

How he her chamber-window will ascend,<br>

And with a Corded-ladder fetch her downe:<br>

For which, the youthfull Louer now is gone,<br>

And this way comes he with it presently.<br>

Where (if it please you) you may intercept him.<br>

But (good my Lord) doe it so cunningly<br>

That my discouery be not aimed at:<br>

For, loue of you, not hate vnto my friend,<br>

Hath made me publisher of this pretence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01236">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Vpon mine Honor, he shall neuer know<br>

That I had any light from thee of this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01237"> Pro. Adiew, my Lord, Sir Valentine is comming</p><br>

<p id="id01238">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Sir Valentine, whether away so fast?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Please it your Grace, there is a Messenger<br>

That stayes to beare my Letters to my friends,<br>

And I am going to deliuer them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Be they of much import?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. The tenure of them doth but signifie<br>

My health, and happy being at your Court<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01240">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Nay then no matter: stay with me a while,<br>

I am to breake with thee of some affaires<br>

That touch me neere: wherein thou must be secret.<br>

'Tis not vnknown to thee, that I haue sought<br>

To match my friend Sir Thurio, to my daughter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I know it well (my Lord) and sure the Match<br>

Were rich and honourable: besides, the gentleman<br>

Is full of Vertue, Bounty, Worth, and Qualities<br>

Beseeming such a Wife, as your faire daughter:<br>

Cannot your Grace win her to fancie him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. No, trust me, She is peeuish, sullen, froward,<br>

Prowd, disobedient, stubborne, lacking duty,<br>

Neither regarding that she is my childe,<br>

Nor fearing me, as if I were her father:<br>

And may I say to thee, this pride of hers<br>

(Vpon aduice) hath drawne my loue from her,<br>

And where I thought the remnant of mine age<br>

Should haue beene cherish'd by her child-like dutie,<br>

I now am full resolu'd to take a wife,<br>

And turne her out, to who will take her in:<br>

Then let her beauty be her wedding dowre:<br>

For me, and my possessions she esteemes not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01242">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. What would your Grace haue me to do in this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. There is a Lady in Verona heere<br>

Whom I affect: but she is nice, and coy,<br>

And naught esteemes my aged eloquence.<br>

Now therefore would I haue thee to my Tutor<br>

(For long agone I haue forgot to court,<br>

Besides the fashion of the time is chang'd)<br>

How, and which way I may bestow my selfe<br>

To be regarded in her sun-bright eye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words,<br>

Dumbe Iewels often in their silent kinde<br>

More then quicke words, doe moue a womans minde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01244">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. But she did scorne a present that I sent her,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. A woman somtime scorns what best co[n]tents her.<br>

Send her another: neuer giue her ore,<br>

For scorne at first, makes after-loue the more.<br>

If she doe frowne, 'tis not in hate of you,<br>

But rather to beget more loue in you.<br>

If she doe chide, 'tis not to haue you gone,<br>

For why, the fooles are mad, if left alone.<br>

Take no repulse, what euer she doth say,<br>

For, get you gon, she doth not meane away.<br>

Flatter, and praise, commend, extoll their graces:<br>

Though nere so blacke, say they haue Angells faces,<br>

That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,<br>

If with his tongue he cannot win a woman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. But she I meane, is promis'd by her friends<br>

Vnto a youthfull Gentleman of worth,<br>

And kept seuerely from resort of men,<br>

That no man hath accesse by day to her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01246"> Val. Why then I would resort to her by night</p><br>

<p id="id01247">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I, but the doores be lockt, and keyes kept safe,<br>

That no man hath recourse to her by night<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01248">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. What letts but one may enter at her window?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,<br>

And built so sheluing, that one cannot climbe it<br>

Without apparant hazard of his life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01249">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Why then a Ladder quaintly made of Cords<br>

To cast vp, with a paire of anchoring hookes,<br>

Would serue to scale another Hero's towre,<br>

So bold Leander would aduenture it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01250">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Now as thou art a Gentleman of blood<br>

Aduise me, where I may haue such a Ladder<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01251"> Val. When would you vse it? pray sir, tell me that</p><br>

<p id="id01252">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. This very night; for Loue is like a childe<br>

That longs for euery thing that he can come by<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01253"> Val. By seauen a clock, ile get you such a Ladder</p><br>

<p id="id01254">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk But harke thee: I will goe to her alone,<br>

How shall I best conuey the Ladder thither?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. It will be light (my Lord) that you may beare it<br>

Vnder a cloake, that is of any length<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01255">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. A cloake as long as thine will serue the turne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I my good Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Then let me see thy cloake,<br>

Ile get me one of such another length<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01257">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Why any cloake will serue the turn (my Lord)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. How shall I fashion me to weare a cloake?<br>

I pray thee let me feele thy cloake vpon me.<br>

What Letter is this same? what's here? to Siluia?<br>

And heere an Engine fit for my proceeding,<br>

Ile be so bold to breake the seale for once.<br>

My thoughts do harbour with my Siluia nightly,<br>

And slaues they are to me, that send them flying.<br>

Oh, could their Master come, and goe as lightly,<br>

Himselfe would lodge where (senceles) they are lying.<br>

My Herald Thoughts, in thy pure bosome rest-them,<br>

While I (their King) that thither them importune<br>

Doe curse the grace, that with such grace hath blest them,<br>

Because my selfe doe want my seruants fortune.<br>

I curse my selfe, for they are sent by me,<br>

That they should harbour where their Lord should be.<br>

What's here? Siluia, this night I will enfranchise thee.<br>

'Tis so: and heere's the Ladder for the purpose.<br>

Why Phaeton (for thou art Merops sonne)<br>

Wilt thou aspire to guide the heauenly Car?<br>

And with thy daring folly burne the world?<br>

Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?<br>

Goe base Intruder, ouer-weening Slaue,<br>

Bestow thy fawning smiles on equall mates,<br>

And thinke my patience, (more then thy desert)<br>

Is priuiledge for thy departure hence.<br>

Thanke me for this, more then for all the fauors<br>

Which (all too-much) I haue bestowed on thee.<br>

But if thou linger in my Territories<br>

Longer then swiftest expedition<br>

Will giue thee time to leaue our royall Court,<br>

By heauen, my wrath shall farre exceed the loue<br>

I euer bore my daughter, or thy selfe.<br>

Be gone, I will not heare thy vaine excuse,<br>

But as thou lou'st thy life, make speed from hence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01258">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. And why not death, rather then liuing torment?<br>

To die, is to be banisht from my selfe,<br>

And Siluia is my selfe: banish'd from her<br>

Is selfe from selfe. A deadly banishment:<br>

What light, is light, if Siluia be not seene?<br>

What ioy is ioy, if Siluia be not by?<br>

Vnlesse it be to thinke that she is by<br>

And feed vpon the shadow of perfection.<br>

Except I be by Siluia in the night,<br>

There is no musicke in the Nightingale.<br>

Vnlesse I looke on Siluia in the day,<br>

There is no day for me to looke vpon.<br>

Shee is my essence, and I leaue to be;<br>

If I be not by her faire influence<br>

Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept aliue.<br>

I flie not death, to flie his deadly doome,<br>

Tarry I heere, I but attend on death,<br>

But flie I hence, I flie away from life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01259"> Pro. Run (boy) run, run, and seeke him out</p><br>

<p id="id01260">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lau. So-hough, Soa hough-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. What seest thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lau. Him we goe to finde,<br>

There's not a haire on's head, but 'tis a Valentine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01261">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Valentine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01262">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Who then? his Spirit?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Neither,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. What then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Nothing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01263">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lau. Can nothing speake? Master, shall I strike?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Who wouldst thou strike?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lau. Nothing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01264"> Pro. Villaine, forbeare</p><br>

<p id="id01265"> Lau. Why Sir, Ile strike nothing: I pray you</p><br>

<p id="id01266"> Pro. Sirha, I say forbeare: friend Valentine, a word</p><br>

<p id="id01267">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. My eares are stopt, &amp; cannot hear good newes,<br>

So much of bad already hath possest them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01268">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Then in dumbe silence will I bury mine,<br>

For they are harsh, vn-tuneable, and bad<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01269">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Is Siluia dead?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. No, Valentine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01270">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No Valentine indeed, for sacred Siluia,<br>

Hath she forsworne me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. No, Valentine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01271">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No Valentine, if Siluia haue forsworne me.<br>

What is your newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lau. Sir, there is a proclamation, y you are vanished<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01272">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. That thou art banish'd: oh that's the newes,<br>

From hence, from Siluia, and from me thy friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01273">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Oh, I haue fed vpon this woe already,<br>

And now excesse of it will make me surfet.<br>

Doth Siluia know that I am banish'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I, I: and she hath offered to the doome<br>

(Which vn-reuerst stands in effectuall force)<br>

A Sea of melting pearle, which some call teares;<br>

Those at her fathers churlish feete she tenderd,<br>

With them vpon her knees, her humble selfe,<br>

Wringing her hands, whose whitenes so became them,<br>

As if but now they waxed pale for woe:<br>

But neither bended knees, pure hands held vp,<br>

Sad sighes, deepe grones, nor siluer-shedding teares<br>

Could penetrate her vncompassionate Sire;<br>

But Valentine, if he be tane, must die.<br>

Besides, her intercession chaf'd him so,<br>

When she for thy repeale was suppliant,<br>

That to close prison he commanded her,<br>

With many bitter threats of biding there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01274">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No more: vnles the next word that thou speak'st<br>

Haue some malignant power vpon my life:<br>

If so: I pray thee breath it in mine eare,<br>

As ending Antheme of my endlesse dolor<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01275">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Cease to lament for that thou canst not helpe,<br>

And study helpe for that which thou lament'st,<br>

Time is the Nurse, and breeder of all good;<br>

Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy loue:<br>

Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life:<br>

Hope is a louers staffe, walke hence with that<br>

And manage it, against despairing thoughts:<br>

Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,<br>

Which, being writ to me, shall be deliuer'd<br>

Euen in the milke-white bosome of thy Loue.<br>

The time now serues not to expostulate,<br>

Come, Ile conuey thee through the City-gate.<br>

And ere I part with thee, confer at large<br>

Of all that may concerne thy Loue-affaires:<br>

As thou lou'st Siluia (though not for thy selfe)<br>

Regard thy danger, and along with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01276">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. I pray thee Launce, and if thou seest my Boy<br>

Bid him make haste, and meet me at the North-gate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01277"> Pro. Goe sirha, finde him out: Come Valentine</p><br>

<p id="id01278"> Val. Oh my deere Siluia; haplesse Valentine</p><br>

<p id="id01279"> Launce. I am but a foole, looke you, and yet I haue
the wit to thinke my Master is a kinde of a knaue: but
that's all one, if he be but one knaue: He liues not now
that knowes me to be in loue, yet I am in loue, but a
Teeme of horse shall not plucke that from me: nor who
'tis I loue: and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
will not tell my selfe: and yet 'tis a Milke-maid: yet 'tis
not a maid: for shee hath had Gossips: yet 'tis a maid,
for she is her Masters maid, and serues for wages. Shee
hath more qualities then a Water-Spaniell, which is
much in a bare Christian: Heere is the Catelog of her
Condition. Inprimis. Shee can fetch and carry: why
a horse can doe no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but
onely carry, therefore is shee better then a Iade. Item.
She can milke, looke you, a sweet vertue in a maid with
cleane hands</p><br>

<p id="id01280">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed. How now Signior Launce? what newes with<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;La. Why, as blacke as Inke<br>

<p id="id01282">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Let me read them?<br>

<p id="id01283"> Sp. Thou lyest: I can</p><br>

<p id="id01284">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. I will try thee: tell me this: who begot thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sp. Marry, the son of my Grand-father<br>

<p id="id01285">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. Oh illiterate loyterer; it was the sonne of thy<br>

<p id="id01296" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> La. Then may I set the world on wheeles, when she
can spin for her liuing</p><br>

<p id="id01297"> Sp. Item, she hath many namelesse vertues</p><br>

<p id="id01298"> La. That's as much as to say Bastard-vertues: that

talke</p><br>

<p id="id01307"> Sp. Item, she is slow in words</p><br>

To be slow in words, is a womans onely vertue:<br>

I pray thee out with't, and place it for her chiefe vertue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01309"> Sp. Item, she is proud</p><br>

<p id="id01333">Enter Duke, Thurio, Protheus.</p><br>

<p id="id01334">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Sir Thurio, feare not, but that she will loue you<br>

Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01335">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th. Since his exile she hath despis'd me most,<br>

Forsworne my company, and rail'd at me,<br>

That I am desperate of obtaining her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01336">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. This weake impresse of Loue, is as a figure<br>

Trenched in ice, which with an houres heate<br>

Dissolues to water, and doth loose his forme.<br>

A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,<br>

And worthlesse Valentine shall be forgot.<br>

How now sir Protheus, is your countriman<br>

(According to our Proclamation) gon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Gon, my good Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01337">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. My daughter takes his going grieuously?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. A little time (my Lord) will kill that griefe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01338">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. So I beleeue: but Thurio thinkes not so:<br>

Protheus, the good conceit I hold of thee,<br>

(For thou hast showne some signe of good desert)<br>

Makes me the better to confer with thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01339">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Longer then I proue loyall to your Grace,<br>

Let me not liue, to looke vpon your Grace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01340">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Thou know'st how willingly, I would effect<br>

The match betweene sir Thurio, and my daughter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I doe my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01341">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. And also, I thinke, thou art not ignorant<br>

How she opposes her against my will?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. She did my Lord, when Valentine was here<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01342">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. I, and peruersly, she perseuers so:<br>

What might we doe to make the girle forget<br>

The loue of Valentine, and loue sir Thurio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. The best way is, to slander Valentine,<br>

With falsehood, cowardize, and poore discent:<br>

Three things, that women highly hold in hate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01343"> Du. I, but she'll thinke, that it is spoke in hate</p><br>

<p id="id01344">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I, if his enemy deliuer it.<br>

Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken<br>

By one, whom she esteemeth as his friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01345"> Du. Then you must vndertake to slander him</p><br>

<p id="id01346">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. And that (my Lord) I shall be loath to doe:<br>

'Tis an ill office for a Gentleman,<br>

Especially against his very friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01347">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Where your good word cannot aduantage him,<br>

Your slander neuer can endamage him;<br>

Therefore the office is indifferent,<br>

Being intreated to it by your friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01348">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. You haue preuail'd (my Lord) if I can doe it<br>

By ought that I can speake in his dispraise,<br>

She shall not long continue loue to him:<br>

But say this weede her loue from Valentine,<br>

It followes not that she will loue sir Thurio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01349">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th. Therefore, as you vnwinde her loue from him;<br>

Least it should rauell, and be good to none,<br>

You must prouide to bottome it on me:<br>

Which must be done, by praising me as much<br>

As you, in worth dispraise, sir Valentine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. And Protheus, we dare trust you in this kinde,<br>

Because we know (on Valentines report)<br>

You are already loues firme votary,<br>

And cannot soone reuolt, and change your minde.<br>

Vpon this warrant, shall you haue accesse,<br>

Where you, with Siluia, may conferre at large.<br>

For she is lumpish, heauy, mellancholly,<br>

And (for your friends sake) will be glad of you;<br>

Where you may temper her, by your perswasion,<br>

To hate yong Valentine, and loue my friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01351">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. As much as I can doe, I will effect:<br>

But you sir Thurio, are not sharpe enough:<br>

You must lay Lime, to tangle her desires<br>

By walefull Sonnets, whose composed Rimes<br>

Should be full fraught with seruiceable vowes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01352"> Du. I, much is the force of heauen-bred Poesie</p><br>

<p id="id01353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Say that vpon the altar of her beauty<br>

You sacrifice your teares, your sighes, your heart:<br>

Write till your inke be dry: and with your teares<br>

Moist it againe: and frame some feeling line,<br>

That may discouer such integrity:<br>

For Orpheus Lute, was strung with Poets sinewes,<br>

Whose golden touch could soften steele and stones;<br>

Make Tygers tame, and huge Leuiathans<br>

Forsake vnsounded deepes, to dance on Sands.<br>

After your dire-lamenting Elegies,<br>

Visit by night your Ladies chamber-window<br>

With some sweet Consort; To their Instruments<br>

Tune a deploring dumpe: the nights dead silence<br>

Will well become such sweet complaining grieuance:<br>

This, or else nothing, will inherit her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01354"> Du. This discipline, showes thou hast bin in loue</p><br>

<p id="id01355">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th. And thy aduice, this night, ile put in practise:<br>

Therefore, sweet Protheus, my direction-giuer,<br>

Let vs into the City presently<br>

To sort some Gentlemen, well skil'd in Musicke.<br>

I haue a Sonnet, that will serue the turne<br>

To giue the on-set to thy good aduise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01356"> Du. About it Gentlemen</p><br>

<p id="id01357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. We'll wait vpon your Grace, till after Supper,<br>

And afterward determine our proceedings<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01358"> Du. Euen now about it, I will pardon you.</p><br>

But yet I slew him manfully, in fight,<br>

Without false vantage, or base treachery<br>

Vnder the colour of commending him,<br>

I haue accesse my owne loue to prefer.<br>

But Siluia is too faire, too true, too holy,<br>

To be corrupted with my worthlesse guifts;<br>

She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;<br>

When to her beauty I commend my vowes,<br>

She bids me thinke how I haue bin forsworne<br>

In breaking faith with Iulia, whom I lou'd;<br>

And notwithstanding all her sodaine quips,<br>

The least whereof would quell a louers hope:<br>

Yet (Spaniel-like) the more she spurnes my loue,<br>

<p id="id01431">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I grant (sweet loue) that I did loue a Lady,<br>

But she is dead<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01432">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. 'Twere false, if I should speake it;<br>

For I am sure she is not buried<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01433">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Say that she be: yet Valentine thy friend<br>

Suruiues; to whom (thy selfe art witnesse)<br>

I am betroth'd; and art thou not asham'd<br>

To wrong him, with thy importunacy?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I likewise heare that Valentine is dead<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01434">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. And so suppose am I; for in her graue<br>

Assure thy selfe, my loue is buried<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01435"> Pro. Sweet Lady, let me rake it from the earth</p><br>

<p id="id01436">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Goe to thy Ladies graue and call hers thence,<br>

Or at the least, in hers, sepulcher thine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01437"> Iul. He heard not that</p><br>

<p id="id01438">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Madam: if your heart be so obdurate:<br>

Vouchsafe me yet your Picture for my loue,<br>

The Picture that is hanging in your chamber:<br>

To that ile speake, to that ile sigh and weepe:<br>

For since the substance of your perfect selfe<br>

Is else deuoted, I am but a shadow;<br>

And to your shadow, will I make true loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01439">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. If 'twere a substance you would sure deceiue it,<br>

And make it but a shadow, as I am<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01440">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. I am very loath to be your Idoll Sir;<br>

But, since your falsehood shall become you well<br>

To worship shadowes, and adore false shapes,<br>

Send to me in the morning, and ile send it:<br>

And so, good rest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01441">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. As wretches haue ore-night<br>

That wait for execution in the morne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01442">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Host, will you goe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho. By my hallidome, I was fast asleepe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01443">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Pray you, where lies Sir Protheus?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho. Marry, at my house:<br>

Trust me, I thinke 'tis almost day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01444">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Not so: but it hath bin the longest night<br>

That ere I watch'd, and the most heauiest.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01446">Enter Eglamore, Siluia.</p><br>

Thy selfe hast lou'd, and I haue heard thee say<br>

No griefe did euer come so neere thy heart,<br>

As when thy Lady, and thy true-loue dide,<br>

Vpon whose Graue thou vow'dst pure chastitie:<br>

Sir Eglamoure: I would to Valentine<br>

To Mantua, where I heare, he makes aboad;<br>

And for the waies are dangerous to passe,<br>

I doe desire thy worthy company,<br>

Vpon whose faith and honor, I repose.<br>

Vrge not my fathers anger (Eglamoure)<br>

But thinke vpon my griefe (a Ladies griefe)<br>

And on the iustice of my flying hence,<br>

To keepe me from a most vnholy match,<br>

Which heauen and fortune still rewards with plagues.<br>

I doe desire thee, euen from a heart<br>

As full of sorrowes, as the Sea of sands,<br>

To beare me company, and goe with me:<br>

If not, to hide what I haue said to thee,<br>

That I may venture to depart alone<br>

<p id="id01458"> Lau. When a mans seruant shall play the Curre with
him (looke you) it goes hard: one that I brought vp of
a puppy: one that I sau'd from drowning, when three or
foure of his blinde brothers and sisters went to it: I haue
taught him (euen as one would say precisely, thus I
would teach a dog) I was sent to deliuer him, as a present
to Mistris Siluia, from my Master; and I came no
sooner into the dyning-chamber, but he steps me to her
Trencher, and steales her Capons-leg: O, 'tis a foule
thing, when a Cur cannot keepe himselfe in all companies:
I would haue (as one should say) one that takes vpon
him to be a dog indeede, to be, as it were, a dog at all
things. If I had not had more wit then he, to take a fault
vpon me that he did, I thinke verily hee had bin hang'd
for't: sure as I liue he had suffer'd for't: you shall iudge:
Hee thrusts me himselfe into the company of three or
foure gentleman-like-dogs, vnder the Dukes table: hee
had not bin there (blesse the marke) a pissing while, but
all the chamber smelt him: out with the dog (saies one)
what cur is that (saies another) whip him out (saies the
third) hang him vp (saies the Duke.) I hauing bin acquainted
with the smell before, knew it was Crab; and
goes me to the fellow that whips the dogges: friend
(quoth I) you meane to whip the dog: I marry doe I
(quoth he) you doe him the more wrong (quoth I) 'twas
I did the thing you wot of: he makes me no more adoe,
but whips me out of the chamber: how many Masters
would doe this for his Seruant? nay, ile be sworne I haue
sat in the stockes, for puddings he hath stolne, otherwise
he had bin executed: I haue stood on the Pillorie for
Geese he hath kil'd, otherwise he had sufferd for't: thou
think'st not of this now: nay, I remember the tricke you
seru'd me, when I tooke my leaue of Madam Siluia: did
not I bid thee still marke me, and doe as I do; when did'st
thou see me heaue vp my leg, and make water against a
Gentlewomans farthingale? did'st thou euer see me doe
such a tricke?
 Pro. Sebastian is thy name: I like thee well,
And will imploy thee in some seruice presently</p><br>

<p id="id01459"> Iu. In what you please, ile doe what I can</p><br>

<p id="id01460">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I hope thou wilt.<br>

How now you whorson pezant,<br>

Where haue you bin these two dayes loytering?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;La. Marry Sir, I carried Mistris Siluia the dogge you<br>

bad me<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;La. Marry she saies your dog was a cur, and tels you<br>

currish thanks is good enough for such a present<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01462">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. But she receiu'd my dog?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;La. No indeede did she not:<br>

Here haue I brought him backe againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01463">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. What, didst thou offer her this from me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;La. I Sir, the other Squirrill was stolne from me<br>

By the Hangmans boyes in the market place,<br>

And then I offer'd her mine owne, who is a dog<br>

As big as ten of yours, &amp; therefore the guift the greater<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01464">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Goe, get thee hence, and finde my dog againe,<br>

Or nere returne againe into my sight.<br>

Away, I say: stayest thou to vexe me here;<br>

A Slaue, that still an end, turnes me to shame:<br>

Sebastian, I haue entertained thee,<br>

Partly that I haue neede of such a youth,<br>

That can with some discretion doe my businesse:<br>

For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish Lowt;<br>

But chiefely, for thy face, and thy behauiour,<br>

Which (if my Augury deceiue me not)<br>

Witnesse good bringing vp, fortune, and truth:<br>

Therefore know thee, for this I entertaine thee.<br>

Deliuer it to Madam Siluia;<br>

She lou'd me well, deliuer'd it to me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01465">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. It seemes you lou'd not her, not leaue her token:<br>

She is dead belike?<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id01466"> Iul. Alas</p><br>

<p id="id01467">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Why do'st thou cry alas?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. I cannot choose but pitty her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01468">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Wherefore should'st thou pitty her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Because, me thinkes that she lou'd you as well<br>

As you doe loue your Lady Siluia:<br>

She dreames on him, that has forgot her loue,<br>

You doate on her, that cares not for your loue.<br>

'Tis pitty Loue, should be so contrary:<br>

And thinking on it, makes me cry alas<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01469">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Well: giue her that Ring, and therewithall<br>

This Letter: that's her chamber: Tell my Lady,<br>

I claime the promise for her heauenly Picture:<br>

Your message done, hye home vnto my chamber,<br>

Where thou shalt finde me sad, and solitarie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01470">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. How many women would doe such a message?<br>

Alas poore Protheus, thou hast entertain'd<br>

A Foxe, to be the Shepheard of thy Lambs;<br>

Alas, poore foole, why doe I pitty him<br>

That with his very heart despiseth me?<br>

Because he loues her, he despiseth me,<br>

Because I loue him, I must pitty him.<br>

This Ring I gaue him, when he parted from me,<br>

To binde him to remember my good will:<br>

And now am I (vnhappy Messenger)<br>

To plead for that, which I would not obtaine;<br>

To carry that, which I would haue refus'd;<br>

To praise his faith, which I would haue disprais'd.<br>

I am my Masters true confirmed Loue,<br>

But cannot be true seruant to my Master,<br>

Vnlesse I proue false traitor to my selfe.<br>

Yet will I woe for him, but yet so coldly,<br>

As (heauen it knowes) I would not haue him speed.<br>

Gentlewoman, good day: I pray you be my meane<br>

To bring me where to speake with Madam Siluia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01471">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. What would you with her, if that I be she?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. If you be she, I doe intreat your patience<br>

To heare me speake the message I am sent on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01472">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. From whom?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. From my Master, Sir Protheus, Madam<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01473">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Oh: he sends you for a Picture?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. I, Madam<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01474">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Vrsula, bring my Picture there,<br>

Goe, giue your Master this: tell him from me,<br>

One Iulia, that his changing thoughts forget<br>

Would better fit his Chamber, then this Shadow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01475">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Madam, please you peruse this Letter;<br>

Pardon me (Madam) I haue vnaduis'd<br>

Deliuer'd you a paper that I should not;<br>

This is the Letter to your Ladiship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01476"> Sil. I pray thee let me looke on that againe</p><br>

<p id="id01477"> Iul. It may not be: good Madam pardon me</p><br>

<p id="id01478">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. There, hold:<br>

I will not looke vpon your Masters lines:<br>

I know they are stuft with protestations,<br>

And full of new-found oathes, which he will breake<br>

As easily, as I doe teare his paper<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01479"> Iul. Madam, he sends your Ladiship this Ring</p><br>

<p id="id01480">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. The more shame for him, that he sends it me;<br>

For I haue heard him say a thousand times,<br>

His Iulia gaue it him, at his departure:<br>

Though his false finger haue prophan'd the Ring,<br>

Mine shall not doe his Iulia so much wrong<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01481"> Iul. She thankes you</p><br>

<p id="id01482">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. What sai'st thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. I thanke you Madam, that you tender her:<br>

Poore Gentlewoman, my Master wrongs her much<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01483">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Do'st thou know her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Almost as well as I doe know my selfe.<br>

To thinke vpon her woes, I doe protest<br>

That I haue wept a hundred seuerall times<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01484">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Belike she thinks that Protheus hath forsook her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. I thinke she doth: and that's her cause of sorrow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01485">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Is she not passing faire?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. She hath bin fairer (Madam) then she is,<br>

When she did thinke my Master lou'd her well;<br>

She, in my iudgement, was as faire as you.<br>

But since she did neglect her looking-glasse,<br>

And threw her Sun-expelling Masque away,<br>

The ayre hath staru'd the roses in her cheekes,<br>

And pinch'd the lilly-tincture of her face,<br>

That now she is become as blacke as I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01486">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. How tall was she?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. About my stature: for at Pentecost,<br>

When all our Pageants of delight were plaid,<br>

Our youth got me to play the womans part,<br>

And I was trim'd in Madam Iulias gowne,<br>

Which serued me as fit, by all mens iudgements,<br>

As if the garment had bin made for me:<br>

Therefore I know she is about my height,<br>

And at that time I made her weepe a good,<br>

For I did play a lamentable part.<br>

(Madam) 'twas Ariadne, passioning<br>

For Thesus periury, and vniust flight;<br>

Which I so liuely acted with my teares:<br>

That my poore Mistris moued therewithall,<br>

Wept bitterly: and would I might be dead,<br>

If I in thought felt not her very sorrow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01487">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. She is beholding to thee (gentle youth)<br>

Alas (poore Lady) desolate, and left;<br>

I weepe my selfe to thinke vpon thy words:<br>

Here youth: there is my purse; I giue thee this<br>

For thy sweet Mistris sake, because thou lou'st her. Farewell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01488">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. And she shall thanke you for't, if ere you know her.<br>

A vertuous gentlewoman, milde, and beautifull.<br>

I hope my Masters suit will be but cold,<br>

Since she respects my Mistris loue so much.<br>

Alas, how loue can trifle with it selfe:<br>

Here is her Picture: let me see, I thinke<br>

If I had such a Tyre, this face of mine<br>

Were full as louely, as is this of hers;<br>

And yet the Painter flatter'd her a little,<br>

Vnlesse I flatter with my selfe too much.<br>

Her haire is Aburne, mine is perfect Yellow;<br>

If that be all the difference in his loue,<br>

Ile get me such a coulour'd Perrywig:<br>

Her eyes are grey as glasse, and so are mine.<br>

I, but her fore-head's low, and mine's as high:<br>

What should it be that he respects in her,<br>

But I can make respectiue in my selfe?<br>

If this fond Loue, were not a blinded god.<br>

Come shadow, come, and take this shadow vp,<br>

For 'tis thy riuall: O thou sencelesse forme,<br>

Thou shalt be worship'd, kiss'd, lou'd, and ador'd;<br>

And were there sence in his Idolatry,<br>

My substance should be statue in thy stead.<br>

Ile vse thee kindly, for thy Mistris sake<br>

That vs'd me so: or else by Ioue, I vow,<br>

I should haue scratch'd out your vnseeing eyes,<br>

To make my Master out of loue with thee.<br>

<p id="id01536">&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How vse doth breed a habit in a man?<br>

This shadowy desart, vnfrequented woods<br>

I better brooke then flourishing peopled Townes:<br>

Here can I sit alone, vn-seene of any,<br>

And to the Nightingales complaining Notes<br>

Tune my distresses, and record my woes.<br>

O thou that dost inhabit in my brest,<br>

Leaue not the Mansion so long Tenant-lesse,<br>

Lest growing ruinous, the building fall,<br>

And leaue no memory of what it was,<br>

Repaire me, with thy presence, Siluia:<br>

Thou gentle Nimph, cherish thy forlorne swaine.<br>

What hallowing, and what stir is this to day?<br>

These are my mates, that make their wills their Law,<br>

Haue some vnhappy passenger in chace;<br>

They loue me well: yet I haue much to doe<br>

To keepe them from vnciuill outrages.<br>

Withdraw thee Valentine: who's this comes heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Madam, this seruice I haue done for you<br>

(Though you respect not aught your seruant doth)<br>

To hazard life, and reskew you from him,<br>

That would haue forc'd your honour, and your loue,<br>

Vouchsafe me for my meed, but one faire looke:<br>

(A smaller boone then this I cannot beg,<br>

And lesse then this, I am sure you cannot giue.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. How like a dreame is this? I see, and heare:<br>

Loue, lend me patience to forbeare a while<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01537"> Sil. O miserable, vnhappy that I am</p><br>

Rather then haue false Protheus reskue me:<br>

Oh heauen be iudge how I loue Valentine,<br>

Whose life's as tender to me as my soule,<br>

And full as much (for more there cannot be)<br>

I doe detest false periur'd Protheus:<br>

Therefore be gone, sollicit me no more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01542">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. What dangerous action, stood it next to death<br>

Would I not vndergoe, for one calme looke:<br>

Oh 'tis the curse in Loue, and still approu'd<br>

When women cannot loue, where they're belou'd<br>

Read ouer Iulia's heart, (thy first best Loue)<br>

For whose deare sake, thou didst then rend thy faith<br>

Into a thousand oathes; and all those oathes,<br>

Descended into periury, to loue me,<br>

Thou hast no faith left now, vnlesse thou'dst two,<br>

And that's farre worse then none: better haue none<br>

Then plurall faith, which is too much by one:<br>

Thou Counterfeyt, to thy true friend<br>
</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. All men but Protheus<br>

<p id="id01545">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Nay, if the gentle spirit of mouing words<br>

Can no way change you to a milder forme;<br>

For such is a friend now: treacherous man,<br>

Thou hast beguil'd my hopes; nought but mine eye<br>

Could haue perswaded me: now I dare not say<br>

I haue one friend aliue; thou wouldst disproue me:<br>

Who should be trusted, when ones right hand<br>

Is periured to the bosome? Protheus<br>

I am sorry I must neuer trust thee more,<br>

But count the world a stranger for thy sake:<br>

The priuate wound is deepest: oh time, most accurst.<br>

'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. My shame and guilt confounds me:<br>

Forgiue me Valentine: if hearty sorrow<br>

Be a sufficient Ransome for offence,<br>

I tender't heere: I doe as truely suffer,<br>

As ere I did commit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01551">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Then I am paid:<br>

And once againe, I doe receiue thee honest;<br>

Who by Repentance is not satisfied,<br>

Is nor of heauen, nor earth; for these are pleas'd:<br>

By Penitence th' Eternalls wrath's appeas'd:<br>

And that my loue may appeare plaine and free,<br>

All that was mine, in Siluia, I giue thee<br>

Why wag: how now? what's the matter? look vp: speak<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id01556">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Where is that ring? boy?<br>

<p id="id01559">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. But how cam'st thou by this ring? at my depart<br>

I gaue this vnto Iulia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01560">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. And Iulia her selfe did giue it me,<br>

And Iulia her selfe hath brought it hither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01561">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. How? Iulia?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iul. Behold her, that gaue ayme to all thy oathes,<br>

And entertain'd 'em deepely in her heart.<br>

How oft hast thou with periury cleft the roote?<br>

Oh Protheus, let this habit make thee blush.<br>

Be thou asham'd that I haue tooke vpon me,<br>

Such an immodest rayment; if shame liue<br>

In a disguise of loue?<br>

It is the lesser blot modesty findes,<br>

Women to change their shapes, then men their minds<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01562">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Then men their minds? tis true: oh heuen, were man<br>

But Constant, he were perfect; that one error<br>

Fils him with faults: makes him run through all th' sins;<br>

Inconstancy falls-off, ere it begins:<br>

What is in Siluia's face, but I may spie<br>

More fresh in Iulia's, with a constant eye?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. Come, come: a hand from either:<br>

Let me be blest to make this happy close:<br>

Take but possession of her, with a Touch:<br>

I dare thee, but to breath vpon my Loue<br>

<p id="id01569">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thur. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I:<br>

I hold him but a foole that will endanger<br>

His Body, for a Girle that loues him not:<br>

I claime her not, and therefore she is thine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01570">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. The more degenerate and base art thou<br>

To make such meanes for her, as thou hast done,<br>

And leaue her on such slight conditions.<br>

Now, by the honor of my Ancestry,<br>

I doe applaud thy spirit, Valentine,<br>

And thinke thee worthy of an Empresse loue:<br>

And let them be recall'd from their Exile:<br>

They are reformed, ciuill, full of good,<br>

And fit for great employment (worthy Lord.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Thou hast preuaild, I pardon them and thee:<br>

Dispose of them, as thou knowst their deserts.<br>

Come, let vs goe, we will include all iarres,<br>

With Triumphes, Mirth, and rare solemnity<br>

<p id="id01574">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. And as we walke along, I dare be bold<br>

With our discourse, to make your Grace to smile.<br>

What thinke you of this Page (my Lord?)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I think the Boy hath grace in him, he blushes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01575"> Val. I warrant you (my Lord) more grace, then Boy</p><br>

<p id="id01576">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. What meane you by that saying?<br>

 Slen. I will marry her (Sir) at your request; but if
there bee no great loue in the beginning, yet Heauen
may decrease it vpon better acquaintance, when wee
are married, and haue more occasion to know one another:
I hope vpon familiarity will grow more content:

<p id="id01782"> Fen. Shall I doe any good thinkst thou? shall I not

 Qui. Troth Sir, all is in his hands aboue: but notwithstanding
(Master Fenton) Ile be sworne on a booke
shee loues you: haue not your Worship a wart aboue
your eye?
 Fen. Yes marry haue I, what of that?
 Qui. Wel, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
another Nan; (but (I detest) an honest maid as euer
broke bread: wee had an howres talke of that wart; I
shall neuer laugh but in that maids company: but (indeed)
shee is giuen too much to Allicholy and musing:
but for you - well - goe too -
 Fen. Well: I shall see her to day: hold, there's money
for thee: Let mee haue thy voice in my behalfe: if
thou seest her before me, commend me. -
 Qui. Will I? I faith that wee will: And I will tell
your Worship more of the Wart, the next time we haue
confidence, and of other wooers</p><br>

<p id="id01783"> Fen. Well, fare-well, I am in great haste now</p><br>

perceiue how I might bee knighted, I shall thinke the
worse of fat men, as long as I haue an eye to make difference
of mens liking: and yet hee would not sweare:
praise womens modesty: and gaue such orderly and welbehaued
reproofe to al vncomelinesse, that I would haue
sworne his disposition would haue gone to the truth of
his words: but they doe no more adhere and keep place
together, then the hundred Psalms to the tune of Greensleeues:
What tempest (I troa) threw this Whale, (with
so many Tuns of oyle in his belly) a'shoare at Windsor?
How shall I bee reuenged on him? I thinke the best way
were, to entertaine him with hope, till the wicked fire
of lust haue melted him in his owne greace: Did you euer
heare the like?
 Mis.Page. Letter for letter; but that the name of
Page and Ford differs: to thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions, heere's the twyn-brother of thy Letter:
but let thine inherit first, for I protest mine neuer
shall: I warrant he hath a thousand of these Letters, writ
with blancke-space for different names (sure more): and
these are of the second edition: hee will print them out
of doubt: for he cares not what hee puts into the presse,
when he would put vs two: I had rather be a Giantesse,
and lye vnder Mount Pelion: Well; I will find you twentie
lasciuious Turtles ere one chaste man</p><br>

<p id="id01798"> Mis.Ford. Why this is the very same: the very hand:

appoint him a meeting: giue him a show of comfort in
his Suit, and lead him on with a fine baited delay, till hee
hath pawn'd his horses to mine Host of the Garter</p><br>

<p id="id01801"> Mi.Ford. Nay, I wil consent to act any villany against

food to his iealousie</p><br>

<p id="id01802"> Mis.Page. Why look where he comes; and my good

There's the short and the long: My name is Corporall

rogues, now they be out of seruice<br>

toward my wife, I would turne her loose to him;
and what hee gets more of her, then sharpe words, let it
lye on my head</p><br>

<p id="id01827"> Ford. I doe not misdoubt my wife: but I would bee
loath to turne them together: a man may be too confident:

the best Courtier of them all (when the Court lay
at Windsor) could neuer haue brought her to such a Canarie:
yet there has beene Knights, and Lords, and Gentlemen,
with their Coaches; I warrant you Coach after
Coach, letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so sweetly;
all Muske, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silke
and golde, and in such alligant termes, and in such wine
and suger of the best, and the fairest, that would haue
wonne any womans heart: and I warrant you, they could
neuer get an eye-winke of her: I had my selfe twentie
Angels giuen me this morning, but I defie all Angels (in
any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty: and
I warrant you, they could neuer get her so much as sippe
on a cup with the prowdest of them all, and yet there has
beene Earles: nay, (which is more) Pentioners, but I
warrant you all is one with her</p><br>

grace I hope, that were a tricke indeed: But Mistris Page
would desire you to send her your little Page of al loues:
her husband has a maruellous infectio[n] to the little Page:
and truely Master Page is an honest man: neuer a wife in
Windsor leades a better life then she do's: doe what shee
will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goe to bed when
she list, rise when she list, all is as she will: and truly she
deserues it; for if there be a kinde woman in Windsor, she
is one: you must send her your Page, no remedie</p><br>

<p id="id01876"> Fal. Why, I will</p><br>

<p id="id01877"> Qu. Nay, but doe so then, and looke you, hee may
come and goe betweene you both: and in any case haue
a nay-word, that you may know one anothers minde,
and the Boy neuer neede to vnderstand any thing; for
'tis not good that children should know any wickednes:
olde folkes you know, haue discretion, as they say, and
know the world</p><br>

<p id="id01890">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Good Master Broome, I desire more acquaintance<br>

of you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01891"> Ford. Good Sir Iohn, I sue for yours: not to charge
you, for I must let you vnderstand, I thinke my selfe in
better plight for a Lender, then you are: the which hath
something emboldned me to this vnseason'd intrusion:
for they say, if money goe before, all waies doe lye
open</p><br>

<p id="id01892"> Fal. Money is a good Souldier (Sir) and will on</p><br>

<p id="id01893"> Ford. Troth, and I haue a bag of money heere troubles

or halfe, for easing me of the carriage</p><br>

<p id="id01894">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Sir, I know not how I may deserue to bee your<br>

<p id="id01895"> Ford. I will tell you sir, if you will giue mee the hearing</p><br>

<p id="id01896" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fal. Speake (good Master Broome) I shall be glad to
be your Seruant</p><br>

<p id="id01897"> Ford. Sir, I heare you are a Scholler: (I will be briefe
with you) and you haue been a man long knowne to me,
though I had neuer so good means as desire, to make my
selfe acquainted with you. I shall discouer a thing to
you, wherein I must very much lay open mine owne imperfection:
but (good Sir Iohn) as you haue one eye vpon
my follies, as you heare them vnfolded, turne another
into the Register of your owne, that I may passe with a
reproofe the easier, sith you your selfe know how easie it
is to be such an offender</p><br>

<p id="id01898"> Fal. Very well Sir, proceed</p><br>

<p id="id01899" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ford. There is a Gentlewoman in this Towne, her
husbands name is Ford</p><br>

<p id="id01900"> Fal. Well Sir</p><br>

<p id="id01901"> Ford. I haue long lou'd her, and I protest to you, bestowed
much on her: followed her with a doating obseruance:
Ingross'd opportunities to meete her: fee'd euery
slight occasion that could but nigardly giue mee
sight of her: not only bought many presents to giue her,
but haue giuen largely to many, to know what shee
would haue giuen: briefly, I haue pursu'd her, as Loue
hath pursued mee, which hath beene on the wing of all
occasions: but whatsoeuer I haue merited, either in my
minde, or in my meanes, meede I am sure I haue receiued
none, vnlesse Experience be a Iewell, that I haue purchased
at an infinite rate, and that hath taught mee to say
this,
``Loue like a shadow flies, when substance Loue pursues,
``Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues</p><br>

<p id="id01902">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Haue you receiu'd no promise of satisfaction at<br>

her hands?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. Neuer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01903">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Haue you importun'd her to such a purpose?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. Neuer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01904">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Of what qualitie was your loue then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. Like a fair house, built on another mans ground,<br>

so that I haue lost my edifice, by mistaking the place,<br>

where I erected it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01905"> Fal. To what purpose haue you vnfolded this to me?
 For. When I haue told you that, I haue told you all:
Some say, that though she appeare honest to mee, yet in
other places shee enlargeth her mirth so farre, that there
is shrewd construction made of her. Now (Sir Iohn) here
is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance,
authenticke in your place and person, generally
allow'd for your many war-like, court-like, and learned
preparations</p><br>

<p id="id01906"> Fal. O Sir</p><br>

<p id="id01907"> Ford. Beleeue it, for you know it: there is money,
spend it, spend it, spend more; spend all I haue, onely
giue me so much of your time in enchange of it, as to lay
an amiable siege to the honesty of this Fords wife: vse
your Art of wooing; win her to consent to you: if any
man may, you may as soone as any</p><br>

<p id="id01908"> Fal. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection that I should win what you would enioy? Methinkes
you prescribe to your selfe very preposterously</p><br>

<p id="id01909"> Ford. O, vnderstand my drift: she dwells so securely
on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soule
dares not present it selfe: shee is too bright to be look'd
against. Now, could I come to her with any detection
in my hand; my desires had instance and argument to
commend themselues, I could driue her then from the
ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage-vow,
and a thousand other her defences, which now are tootoo
strongly embattaild against me: what say you too't,
Sir Iohn?
 Fal. Master Broome, I will first make bold with your
money: next, giue mee your hand: and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enioy Fords wife</p><br>

<p id="id01910"> Ford. O good Sir</p><br>

<p id="id01911"> Fal. I say you shall</p><br>

<p id="id01912"> Ford. Want no money (Sir Iohn) you shall want none</p><br>

<p id="id01913"> Fal. Want no Mistresse Ford (Master Broome) you shall
want none: I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her
owne appointment, euen as you came in to me, her assistant,
or goe-betweene, parted from me: I say I shall be
with her betweene ten and eleuen: for at that time the
iealious-rascally-knaue her husband will be forth: come
you to me at night, you shall know how I speed</p><br>

<p id="id01914"> Ford. I am blest in your acquaintance: do you know
Ford Sir?
 Fal. Hang him (poore Cuckoldly knaue) I know
him not: yet I wrong him to call him poore: They say
the iealous wittolly-knaue hath masses of money, for
the which his wife seemes to me well-fauourd: I will vse
her as the key of the Cuckoldly-rogues Coffer, &amp; ther's
my haruest-home</p><br>

<p id="id01915" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ford. I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might auoid
him, if you saw him</p><br>

<p id="id01916"> Fal. Hang him, mechanicall-salt-butter rogue; I wil
stare him out of his wits: I will awe-him with my cudgell:
it shall hang like a Meteor ore the Cuckolds horns:
Master Broome, thou shalt know, I will predominate ouer
the pezant, and thou shalt lye with his wife. Come
to me soone at night: Ford's a knaue, and I will aggrauate
his stile: thou (Master Broome) shalt know him for
knaue, and Cuckold. Come to me soone at night</p><br>

<p id="id01917"> Ford. What a damn'd Epicurian-Rascall is this? my
heart is ready to cracke with impatience: who saies this
is improuident iealousie? my wife hath sent to him, the
howre is fixt, the match is made: would any man haue
thought this? see the hell of hauing a false woman: my
bed shall be abus'd, my Coffers ransack'd, my reputation
gnawne at, and I shall not onely receiue this villanous
wrong, but stand vnder the adoption of abhominable
termes, and by him that does mee this wrong: Termes,
names: Amaimon sounds well: Lucifer, well: Barbason,
well: yet they are Diuels additions, the names of fiends:
But Cuckold, Wittoll, Cuckold? the Diuell himselfe
hath not such a name. Page is an Asse, a secure Asse; hee
will trust his wife, hee will not be iealous: I will rather
trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman
with my Cheese, an Irish-man with my Aqua-vitae-bottle,
or a Theefe to walke my ambling gelding, then
my wife with her selfe. Then she plots, then shee ruminates,
then shee deuises: and what they thinke in their
hearts they may effect; they will breake their hearts but
they will effect. Heauen bee prais'd for my iealousie:
eleuen o' clocke the howre, I will preuent this, detect
my wife, bee reueng'd on Falstaffe, and laugh at Page. I
will about it, better three houres too soone, then a mynute
too late: fie, fie, fie: Cuckold, Cuckold, Cuckold.</p><br>

any thinking? Sure they sleepe, he hath no vse of them:
why this boy will carrie a letter twentie mile as easie, as
a Canon will shoot point-blanke twelue score: hee peeces
out his wiues inclination: he giues her folly motion
and aduantage: and now she's going to my wife, &amp; Falstaffes
boy with her: A man may heare this showre sing
in the winde; and Falstaffes boy with her: good plots,
they are laide, and our reuolted wiues share damnation
together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife,
plucke the borrowed vaile of modestie from the so-seeming
Mist[ris]. Page, divulge Page himselfe for a secure and
wilfull Acteon, and to these violent proceedings all my
neighbors shall cry aime. The clocke giues me my Qu,
and my assurance bids me search, there I shall finde Falstaffe:
I shall be rather praisd for this, then mock'd, for
it is as possitiue, as the earth is firme, that Falstaffe is
there: I will go</p><br>

take her simply: the wealth I haue waits on my consent,
and my consent goes not that way</p><br>

 M.Page. What cause of suspition? Out vpon you:
How am I mistooke in you?

 M.Page. Your husband's comming hether (Woman)
with all the Officers in Windsor, to search for a Gentleman,
that he sayes is heere now in the house; by your

with halfe Windsor at his heeles, to serch for such
a one, I come before to tell you: If you know your selfe
cleere, why I am glad of it: but if you haue a friend here,
conuey, conuey him out. Be not amaz'd, call all your

your good life for euer</p><br>

<p id="id02058"> M.Ford. What shall I do? There is a Gentleman my

him. Oh, how haue you deceiu'd me? Looke, heere is a
basket, if he be of any reasonable stature, he may creepe
in heere, and throw fowle linnen vpon him, as if it were
going to bucking: Or it is whiting time, send him by
your two men to Datchet-Meade</p><br>

a benefit</p><br>

<p id="id02072" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Mist.Page. Hang him dishonest rascall: I would all

Fenton, I will not be your friend, nor enemy:<br>

My daughter will I question how she loues you,<br>

And as I finde her, so am I affected:<br>

Till then, farewell Sir, she must needs go in,<br>

Her father will be angry<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02128"> Fen. Farewell gentle Mistris: farewell Nan</p><br>

<p id="id02129"> Qui. This is my doing now: Nay, saide I, will you
cast away your childe on a Foole, and a Physitian:
Looke on M[aster]. Fenton, this is my doing</p><br>

<p id="id02130">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fen. I thanke thee: and I pray thee once to night,<br>

Giue my sweet Nan this Ring: there's for thy paines<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02131"> Qui. Now heauen send thee good fortune, a kinde
heart he hath: a woman would run through fire &amp; water
for such a kinde heart. But yet, I would my Maister
had Mistris Anne, or I would M[aster]. Slender had her: or (in
sooth) I would M[aster]. Fenton had her; I will do what I can
for them all three, for so I haue promisd, and Ile bee as
good as my word, but speciously for M[aster]. Fenton. Well, I
must of another errand to Sir Iohn Falstaffe from my two

<p id="id02137"> Fal. Go, fetch me a quart of Sacke, put a tost in't.
Haue I liu'd to be carried in a Basket like a barrow of
butchers Offall? and to be throwne in the Thames? Wel,
if I be seru'd such another tricke, Ile haue my braines
'tane out and butter'd, and giue them to a dogge for a
New-yeares gift. The rogues slighted me into the riuer
with as little remorse, as they would haue drown'de a
blinde bitches Puppies, fifteene i'th litter: and you may
know by my size, that I haue a kinde of alacrity in sinking:
if the bottome were as deepe as hell, I shold down.
I had beene drown'd, but that the shore was sheluy and
shallow: a death that I abhorre: for the water swelles a
man; and what a thing should I haue beene, when I
had beene swel'd? I should haue beene a Mountaine of
Mummie</p><br>

<p id="id02138"> Bar. Here's M[istris]. Quickly Sir to speake with you</p><br>

<p id="id02139"> Fal. Come, let me poure in some Sack to the Thames

for pilles to coole the reines. Call her in</p><br>

Giue your worship good morrow<br>

Go, brew me a pottle of Sacke finely<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02143">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. With Egges, Sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Simple of it selfe: Ile no Pullet-Spersme in my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui. Marry Sir, I come to your worship from M[istris]. Ford<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02144">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Mist[ris]. Ford? I haue had Ford enough: I was thrown<br>

into the Ford; I haue my belly full of Ford<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02145"> Qui. Alas the day, (good-heart) that was not her
fault: she do's so take on with her men; they mistooke
their erection</p><br>

<p id="id02146"> Fal. So did I mine, to build vpon a foolish Womans promise</p><br>

<p id="id02147"> Qui. Well, she laments Sir for it, that it would yern
your heart to see it: her husband goes this morning a
birding; she desires you once more to come to her, betweene
eight and nine: I must carry her word quickely,
she'll make you amends I warrant you</p><br>

<p id="id02148"> Fal. Well, I will visit her, tell her so: and bidde her
thinke what a man is: Let her consider his frailety, and
then iudge of my merit</p><br>

<p id="id02149"> Qui. I will tell her</p><br>

<p id="id02150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Do so. Betweene nine and ten saist thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui. Eight and nine Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02151"> Fal. Well, be gone: I will not misse her</p><br>

<p id="id02152"> Qui. Peace be with you Sir</p><br>

<p id="id02153"> Fal. I meruaile I heare not of Mr Broome: he sent me
word to stay within: I like his money well.
Oh, heere he comes</p><br>

<p id="id02154"> Ford. Blesse you Sir</p><br>

<p id="id02155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Now M[aster]. Broome, you come to know<br>

What hath past betweene me, and Fords wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02156"> Ford. That indeed (Sir Iohn) is my businesse</p><br>

<p id="id02157">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. M[aster]. Broome I will not lye to you,<br>

I was at her house the houre she appointed me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02158">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. And sped you Sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Very ill-fauouredly M[aster]. Broome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02159"> Ford. How so sir, did she change her determination?
 Fal. No (M[aster]. Broome) but the peaking Curnuto her husband
(M[aster]. Broome) dwelling in a continual larum of ielousie,
coms me in the instant of our encounter, after we had
embrast, kist, protested, &amp; (as it were) spoke the prologue
of our Comedy: and at his heeles, a rabble of his companions,
thither prouoked and instigated by his distemper,
and (forsooth) to serch his house for his wiues Loue</p><br>

<p id="id02160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. What? While you were there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. While I was there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02161"> For. And did he search for you, &amp; could not find you?
 Fal. You shall heare. As good lucke would haue it,
comes in one Mist[ris]. Page, giues intelligence of Fords approch:
and in her inuention, and Fords wiues distraction,
they conuey'd me into a bucke-basket</p><br>

<p id="id02162">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. A Buck-basket?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Yes: a Buck-basket: ram'd mee in with foule<br>

Shirts and Smockes, Socks, foule Stockings, greasie<br>

Napkins, that (Master Broome) there was the rankest<br>

compound of villanous smell, that euer offended nostrill<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02163"> Ford. And how long lay you there?
 Fal. Nay, you shall heare (Master Broome) what I
haue sufferd, to bring this woman to euill, for your
good: Being thus cram'd in the Basket, a couple of
Fords knaues, his Hindes, were cald forth by their Mistris,
to carry mee in the name of foule Cloathes to
Datchet-lane: they tooke me on their shoulders: met
the iealous knaue their Master in the doore; who
ask'd them once or twice what they had in their Basket?
I quak'd for feare least the Lunatique Knaue
would haue search'd it: but Fate (ordaining he should
be a Cuckold) held his hand: well, on went hee, for
a search, and away went I for foule Cloathes: But
marke the sequell (Master Broome) I suffered the pangs
of three seuerall deaths: First, an intollerable fright,
to be detected with a iealious rotten Bell-weather:
Next to be compass'd like a good Bilbo in the circumference
of a Pecke, hilt to point, heele to head. And
then to be stopt in like a strong distillation with stinking
Cloathes, that fretted in their owne grease:
thinke of that, a man of my Kidney; thinke of that,
that am as subiect to heate as butter; a man of continuall
dissolution, and thaw: it was a miracle to scape
suffocation. And in the height of this Bath (when I
was more then halfe stew'd in grease (like a Dutch-dish)
to be throwne into the Thames, and
coold, glowing-hot, in that serge like a Horse-shoo;
thinke of that; hissing hot: thinke of that (Master
Broome.)
 Ford. In good sadnesse Sir, I am sorry, that for my sake
you haue sufferd all this.
My suite then is desperate: You'll vndertake her no
more?
 Fal. Master Broome: I will be throwne into Etna,
as I haue beene into Thames, ere I will leaue her thus;
her Husband is this morning gone a Birding: I
haue receiued from her another ambassie of meeting:
'twixt eight and nine is the houre (Master
Broome.)
 Ford. 'Tis past eight already Sir</p><br>

<p id="id02164"> Fal. Is it? I will then addresse mee to my appointment:
Come to mee at your conuenient leisure, and
you shall know how I speede: and the conclusion
shall be crowned with your enioying her: adiew: you
shall haue her (Master Broome) Master Broome, you shall
cuckold Ford</p><br>

<p id="id02165"> Ford. Hum: ha? Is this a vision? Is this a dreame?
doe I sleepe? Master Ford awake, awake Master Ford:
ther's a hole made in your best coate (Master Ford:) this
'tis to be married; this 'tis to haue Lynnen, and Buckbaskets:
Well, I will proclaime my selfe what I am:
I will now take the Leacher: hee is at my house: hee
cannot scape me: 'tis impossible hee should: hee cannot
creepe into a halfe-penny purse, nor into a PepperBoxe:
But least the Diuell that guides him, should
aide him, I will search impossible places: though
what I am, I cannot auoide; yet to be what I would
not, shall not make me tame: If I haue hornes, to make
one mad, let the prouerbe goe with me, Ile be hornemad.</p><br>

railes against all married mankinde; so curses all Eues
daughters, of what complexion soeuer; and so buffettes
himselfe on the for-head: crying peere-out, peere-out,
that any madnesse I euer yet beheld, seem'd but tamenesse,
ciuility, and patience to this his distemper he is in

out the last time hee search'd for him, in a Basket:

 Ford. Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conuay'd
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why
may not he be there againe, in my house I am sure he is:
my Intelligence is true, my iealousie is reasonable, pluck
me out all the linnen</p><br>

<p id="id02253" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Mist.Ford. If you find a man there, he shall dye a Fleas
death</p><br>

<p id="id02254"> Page. Heer's no man</p><br>

<p id="id02255">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. By my fidelity this is not well Mr. Ford: This<br>

wrongs you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Euans. Mr Ford, you must pray, and not follow the<br>

imaginations of your owne heart: this is iealousies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02257"> Ford. Well, hee's not heere I seeke for</p><br>

<p id="id02258"> Page. No, nor no where else but in your braine</p><br>

<p id="id02259"> Ford. Helpe to search my house this one time: if I find
not what I seeke, shew no colour for my extremity: Let
me for euer be your Table-sport: Let them say of me, as
iealous as Ford, that search'd a hollow Wall-nut for his
wiues Lemman. Satisfie me once more, once more serch
with me</p><br>

<p id="id02260"> M.Ford. What hoa (Mistris Page,) come you and
the old woman downe: my husband will come into the
Chamber</p><br>

<p id="id02261">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. Old woman? what old womans that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;M.Ford. Why it is my maids Aunt of Brainford<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02262"> Ford. A witch, a Queane, an olde couzening queane:
Haue I not forbid her my house. She comes of errands
do's she? We are simple men, wee doe not know what's
brought to passe vnder the profession of Fortune-telling.
She workes by Charmes, by Spels, by th' Figure, &amp; such
dawbry as this is, beyond our Element: wee know nothing.
Come downe you Witch, you Hagge you, come
downe I say</p><br>

<p id="id02263">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Ford. Nay, good sweet husband, good Gentlemen,<br>

let him strike the old woman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02264">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Page. Come mother Prat, Come giue me your<br>

<p id="id02265"> Ford. Ile Prat-her: Out of my doore, you Witch,
you Ragge, you Baggage, you Poulcat, you Runnion,
out, out: Ile coniure you, Ile fortune-tell you</p><br>

<p id="id02266">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Page. Are you not asham'd?<br>

I thinke you haue kill'd the poore woman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02267">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Ford. Nay he will do it, 'tis a goodly credite<br>

for you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02268"> Ford. Hang her witch</p><br>

<p id="id02269"> Eua. By yea, and no, I thinke the o'man is a witch indeede:
I like not when a o'man has a great peard; I spie
a great peard vnder his muffler</p><br>

<p id="id02270"> Ford. Will you follow Gentlemen, I beseech you follow:
see but the issue of my iealousie: If I cry out thus
vpon no traile, neuer trust me when I open againe</p><br>

<p id="id02271">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page. Let's obey his humour a little further:<br>

Come Gentlemen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02272"> Mist.Page. Trust me he beate him most pittifully</p><br>

<p id="id02273">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Ford. Nay by th' Masse that he did not: he beate<br>

him most vnpittifully, me thought<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02274">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Page. Ile haue the cudgell hallow'd, and hung<br>

ore the Altar, it hath done meritorious seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02275"> Mist.Ford. What thinke you? May we with the warrant
of woman-hood, and the witnesse of a good conscience,
pursue him with any further reuenge?
 M.Page. The spirit of wantonnesse is sure scar'd out
of him, if the diuell haue him not in fee-simple, with
fine and recouery, he will neuer (I thinke) in the way of
waste, attempt vs againe</p><br>

<p id="id02276"> Mist.Ford. Shall we tell our husbands how wee haue
seru'd him?
 Mist.Page. Yes, by all meanes: if it be but to scrape
the figures out of your husbands braines: if they can find
in their hearts, the poore vnuertuous fat Knight shall be
any further afflicted, wee two will still bee the ministers</p><br>

<p id="id02277"> Mist.Ford. Ile warrant, they'l haue him publiquely
sham'd, and me thinkes there would be no period to the
iest, should he not be publikely sham'd</p><br>

<p id="id02278">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Page. Come, to the Forge with it, then shape it:<br>

Hunter (sometime a keeper heere in Windsor Forrest)<br>

Doth all the winter time, at still midnight<br>

Walke round about an Oake, with great rag'd-hornes,<br>

And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,<br>

And make milch-kine yeeld blood, and shakes a chaine<br>

In a most hideous and dreadfull manner.<br>

You haue heard of such a Spirit, and well you know<br>

The superstitious idle-headed-Eld<br>

Receiu'd, and did deliuer to our age<br>

This tale of Herne the Hunter, for a truth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02298">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page. Why yet there want not many that do feare<br>

In deepe of night to walke by this Hernes Oake:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Ford. Marry this is our deuise,<br>

That Falstaffe at that Oake shall meete with vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02299">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page. Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,<br>

And in this shape, when you haue brought him thether,<br>

What shall be done with him? What is your plot?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Pa. That likewise haue we thoght vpon: &amp; thus:<br>

Nan Page (my daughter) and my little sonne,<br>

And three or foure more of their growth, wee'l dresse<br>

Like Vrchins, Ouphes, and Fairies, greene and white,<br>

With rounds of waxen Tapers on their heads,<br>

And rattles in their hands; vpon a sodaine,<br>

As Falstaffe, she, and I, are newly met,<br>

Let them from forth a saw-pit rush at once<br>

With some diffused song: Vpon their sight<br>

We two, in great amazednesse will flye:<br>

Then let them all encircle him about,<br>

And Fairy-like to pinch the vncleane Knight;<br>

And aske him why that houre of Fairy Reuell,<br>

In their so sacred pathes, he dares to tread<br>

In shape prophane<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. And till he tell the truth,<br>

Let the supposed Fairies pinch him, sound,<br>

And burne him with their Tapers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02301">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist.Page. The truth being knowne,<br>

We'll all present our selues; dis-horne the spirit,<br>

Ile go buy them vizards<br>

Made promise to the Doctor: Now, thus it rests,<br>

Her Father meanes she shall be all in white;<br>

And in that habit, when Slender sees his time<br>

To take her by the hand, and bid her goe,<br>

She shall goe with him: her Mother hath intended<br>

(The better to deuote her to the Doctor;<br>

For they must all be mask'd, and vizarded)<br>

That quaint in greene, she shall be loose en-roab'd,<br>

With Ribonds-pendant, flaring 'bout her head;<br>

And when the Doctor spies his vantage ripe,<br>

To pinch her by the hand, and on that token,<br>

You were also (Iupiter) a Swan, for the loue of Leda: O

in the semblance of a Fowle, thinke on't (Ioue) a fowle-fault.
When Gods haue hot backes, what shall poore

<p id="id02428"> Page. Of what sonne?
 Slen. I came yonder at Eaton to marry Mistris Anne
Page, and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not bene
i'th Church, I would haue swing'd him, or hee should
haue swing'd me. If I did not thinke it had beene Anne
Page, would I might neuer stirre, and 'tis a Post-masters
Boy</p><br>

<p id="id02429"> Page. Vpon my life then, you tooke the wrong</p><br>

<p id="id02430"> Slen. What neede you tell me that? I think so, when
I tooke a Boy for a Girle: If I had bene married to him,
(for all he was in womans apparrell) I would not haue
had him</p><br>

<p id="id02431"> Page. Why this is your owne folly,
Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter,
By her garments?

it was not Anne, but a Post-masters boy</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fen. You do amaze her: heare the truth of it,<br>

You would haue married her most shamefully,<br>

Where there was no proportion held in loue:<br>

The truth is, she and I (long since contracted)<br>

Are now so sure that nothing can dissolue vs:<br>

Th' offence is holy, that she hath committed,<br>

And this deceit looses the name of craft,<br>

Of disobedience, or vnduteous title,<br>

Since therein she doth euitate and shun<br>

A thousand irreligious cursed houres<br>

Which forced marriage would haue brought vpon her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02436">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford. Stand not amaz'd, here is no remedie:<br>

<p id="id02468"> Luc. If the Duke, with the other Dukes, come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the
Dukes fall vpon the King</p><br>

<p id="id02469" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> 1.Gent. Heauen grant vs its peace, but not the King
of Hungaries</p><br>

<p id="id02470"> 2.Gent. Amen</p><br>

<p id="id02471"> Luc. Thou conclud'st like the Sanctimonious Pirat,
that went to sea with the ten Commandements, but
scrap'd one out of the Table</p><br>

<p id="id02472" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> 2.Gent. Thou shalt not Steale?
 Luc. I, that he raz'd</p><br>

<p id="id02473"> 1.Gent. Why? 'twas a commandement, to command
the Captaine and all the rest from their functions: they
put forth to steale: There's not a Souldier of vs all, that
in the thanks-giuing before meate, do rallish the petition
well, that praies for peace</p><br>

<p id="id02474"> 2.Gent. I neuer heard any Souldier dislike it</p><br>

<p id="id02475" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Luc. I beleeue thee: for I thinke thou neuer was't
where Grace was said</p><br>

<p id="id02476"> 2.Gent. No? a dozen times at least</p><br>

<p id="id02477" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> 1.Gent. What? In meeter?
 Luc. In any proportion: or in any language</p><br>

<p id="id02478"> 1.Gent. I thinke, or in any Religion</p><br>

<p id="id02479"> Luc. I, why not? Grace, is Grace, despight of all controuersie:
as for example; Thou thy selfe art a wicked
villaine, despight of all Grace</p><br>

<p id="id02480">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Gent. Well: there went but a paire of sheeres betweene<br>

vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02481">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. I grant: as there may betweene the Lists, and<br>

the Veluet. Thou art the List<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02482"> 1.Gent. And thou the Veluet; thou art good veluet;
thou'rt a three pild-peece I warrant thee: I had as liefe
be a Lyst of an English Kersey, as be pil'd, as thou art
pil'd, for a French Veluet. Do I speake feelingly now?
 Luc. I thinke thou do'st: and indeed with most painfull
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine owne confession,
learne to begin thy health; but, whilst I liue forget
to drinke after thee</p><br>

<p id="id02483">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Gen. I think I haue done my selfe wrong, haue I not?<br>

<p id="id02484">Enter Bawde.</p><br>

I haue purchas'd as many diseases vnder her Roofe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Gent. To what, I pray?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Iudge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02486"> 2.Gent. To three thousand Dollours a yeare</p><br>

<p id="id02487"> 1.Gent. I, and more</p><br>

<p id="id02488"> Luc. A French crowne more</p><br>

<p id="id02489" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> 1.Gent. Thou art alwayes figuring diseases in me; but
thou art full of error, I am sound</p><br>

<p id="id02490"> Luc. Nay, not (as one would say) healthy: but so
sound, as things that are hollow; thy bones are hollow;
Impiety has made a feast of thee</p><br>

<p id="id02491">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Gent. How now, which of your hips has the most<br>

profound Ciatica?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bawd. Well, well: there's one yonder arrested, and<br>

carried to prison, was worth fiue thousand of you all<br>

<p id="id02492">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Gent. Who's that I pray'thee?<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id02493"> 1.Gent. Claudio to prison? 'tis not so</p><br>

<p id="id02494"> Bawd. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested:
saw him carried away: and which is more, within these
three daies his head to be chop'd off</p><br>

<p id="id02495">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. But, after all this fooling, I would not haue it so:<br>

Art thou sure of this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bawd. I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam<br>

Iulietta with childe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02496"> Luc. Beleeue me this may be: he promis'd to meete
me two howres since, and he was euer precise in promise
keeping</p><br>

<p id="id02497" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> 2.Gent. Besides you know, it drawes somthing neere
to the speech we had to such a purpose</p><br>

<p id="id02498"> 1.Gent. But most of all agreeing with the proclamatio[n]</p><br>

<p id="id02499"> Luc. Away: let's goe learne the truth of it.</p><br>

<p id="id02500">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id02501"> Bawd. Thus, what with the war; what with the sweat,

<p id="id02503"> Clo. Yonder man is carried to prison</p><br>

<p id="id02504">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baw. Well: what has he done?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. A Woman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02505">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baw. But what's his offence?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Groping for Trowts, in a peculiar Riuer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02506">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baw. What? is there a maid with child by him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. No: but there's a woman with maid by him:<br>

you haue not heard of the proclamation, haue you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Baw. What proclamation, man?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. All howses in the Suburbs of Vienna must bee<br>

pluck'd downe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02507">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bawd. And what shall become of those in the Citie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. They shall stand for seed: they had gon down<br>

to, but that a wise Burger put in for them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02508">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bawd. But shall all our houses of resort in the Suburbs<br>

be puld downe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. To the ground, Mistris<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02509"> Bawd. Why heere's a change indeed in the Commonwealth:
what shall become of me?
 Clow. Come: feare not you; good Counsellors lacke
no Clients: though you change your place, you neede
not change your Trade: Ile bee your Tapster still; courage,
there will bee pitty taken on you; you that haue
worne your eyes almost out in the seruice, you will bee
considered</p><br>

<p id="id02510">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bawd. What's to doe heere, Thomas Tapster? let's<br>

withdraw?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the Prouost<br>

to prison: and there's Madam Iuliet.<br>

<p id="id02514">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Fellow, why do'st thou show me thus to th' world?<br>

Beare me to prison, where I am committed<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02515">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I do it not in euill disposition,<br>

But from Lord Angelo by speciall charge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02516">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Thus can the demy-god (Authority)<br>

Make vs pay downe, for our offence, by waight<br>

The words of heauen; on whom it will, it will,<br>

On whom it will not (soe) yet still 'tis iust<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02517"> Luc. Why how now Claudio? whence comes this restraint</p><br>

<p id="id02518">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. From too much liberty, (my Lucio) Liberty<br>

As surfet is the father of much fast,<br>

So euery Scope by the immoderate vse<br>

Turnes to restraint: Our Natures doe pursue<br>

Like Rats that rauyn downe their proper Bane,<br>

A thirsty euill, and when we drinke, we die<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02519"> Luc. If I could speake so wisely vnder an arrest, I
would send for certaine of my Creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief haue the foppery of freedome, as
the mortality of imprisonment: what's thy offence,
Claudio?
 Cla. What (but to speake of) would offend againe</p><br>

<p id="id02520">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. What, is't murder?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. No<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02521">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Lecherie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Call it so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02522"> Pro. Away, Sir, you must goe</p><br>

<p id="id02523">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. One word, good friend:<br>

Lucio, a word with you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02524">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. A hundred:<br>

If they'll doe you any good: Is Lechery so look'd after?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Thus stands it with me: vpon a true contract<br>

I got possession of Iulietas bed,<br>

You know the Lady, she is fast my wife,<br>

Saue that we doe the denunciation lacke<br>

Of outward Order. This we came not to,<br>

Onely for propogation of a Dowre<br>

Remaining in the Coffer of her friends,<br>

From whom we thought it meet to hide our Loue<br>

Till Time had made them for vs. But it chances<br>

The stealth of our most mutuall entertainment<br>

With Character too grosse, is writ on Iuliet<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02525">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. With childe, perhaps?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Vnhappely, euen so.<br>

And the new Deputie, now for the Duke,<br>

Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newnes,<br>

Or whether that the body publique, be<br>

A horse whereon the Gouernor doth ride,<br>

Who newly in the Seate, that it may know<br>

He can command; lets it strait feele the spur:<br>

Whether the Tirranny be in his place,<br>

Or in his Eminence that fills it vp<br>

I stagger in: But this new Gouernor<br>

Awakes me all the inrolled penalties<br>

Which haue (like vn-scowr'd Armor) hung by th' wall<br>

So long, that ninteene Zodiacks haue gone round,<br>

And none of them beene worne; and for a name<br>

Now puts the drowsie and neglected Act<br>

Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02526"> Luc. I warrant it is: And thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders, that a milke-maid, if she be in loue, may
sigh it off: Send after the Duke, and appeale to him</p><br>

<p id="id02527">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. I haue done so, but hee's not to be found.<br>

I pre'thee (Lucio) doe me this kinde seruice:<br>

This day, my sister should the Cloyster enter,<br>

And there receiue her approbation.<br>

Acquaint her with the danger of my state,<br>

Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends<br>

To the strict deputie: bid her selfe assay him,<br>

I haue great hope in that: for in her youth<br>

There is a prone and speechlesse dialect,<br>

Such as moue men: beside, she hath prosperous Art<br>

When she will play with reason, and discourse,<br>

And well she can perswade<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02528"> Luc. I pray shee may; aswell for the encouragement
of the like, which else would stand vnder greeuous imposition:
as for the enioying of thy life, who I would be
sorry should bee thus foolishly lost, at a game of ticketacke:
Ile to her</p><br>

<p id="id02529"> Cla. I thanke you good friend Lucio</p><br>

<p id="id02530"> Luc. Within two houres</p><br>

<p id="id02531"> Cla. Come Officer, away.</p><br>

<p id="id02532">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id02533" style="margin-top: 2em">Scena Quarta.</p><br>

<p id="id02534">Enter Duke and Frier Thomas.</p><br>

<p id="id02535">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. No: holy Father, throw away that thought,<br>

Beleeue not that the dribling dart of Loue<br>

Can pierce a compleat bosome: why, I desire thee<br>

To giue me secret harbour, hath a purpose<br>

More graue, and wrinkled, then the aimes, and ends<br>

Of burning youth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02536">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. May your Grace speake of it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. My holy Sir, none better knowes then you<br>

How I haue euer lou'd the life remoued<br>

And held in idle price, to haunt assemblies<br>

Where youth, and cost, witlesse brauery keepes.<br>

I haue deliuerd to Lord Angelo<br>

(A man of stricture and firme abstinence)<br>

My absolute power, and place here in Vienna,<br>

And he supposes me trauaild to Poland,<br>

(For so I haue strewd it in the common eare)<br>

And so it is receiu'd: Now (pious Sir)<br>

You will demand of me, why I do this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02537"> Fri. Gladly, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id02538">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. We haue strict Statutes, and most biting Laws,<br>

(The needfull bits and curbes to headstrong weedes,)<br>

Which for this foureteene yeares, we haue let slip,<br>

Euen like an ore-growne Lyon in a Caue<br>

That goes not out to prey: Now, as fond Fathers,<br>

Hauing bound vp the threatning twigs of birch,<br>

Onely to sticke it in their childrens sight,<br>

For terror, not to vse: in time the rod<br>

More mock'd, then fear'd: so our Decrees,<br>

Dead to infliction, to themselues are dead,<br>

And libertie, plucks Iustice by the nose;<br>

The Baby beates the Nurse, and quite athwart<br>

Goes all decorum<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02539">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. It rested in your Grace<br>

To vnloose this tyde-vp Iustice, when you pleas'd:<br>

And it in you more dreadfull would haue seem'd<br>

Then in Lord Angelo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02540">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I doe feare: too dreadfull:<br>

Sith 'twas my fault, to giue the people scope,<br>

'Twould be my tirrany to strike and gall them,<br>

For what I bid them doe: For, we bid this be done<br>

When euill deedes haue their permissiue passe,<br>

And not the punishment: therefore indeede (my father)<br>

I haue on Angelo impos'd the office,<br>

Who may in th' ambush of my name, strike home,<br>

And yet, my nature neuer in the sight<br>

To do in slander: And to behold his sway<br>

I will, as 'twere a brother of your Order,<br>

Visit both Prince, and People: Therefore I pre'thee<br>

Supply me with the habit, and instruct me<br>

How I may formally in person beare<br>

Like a true Frier: Moe reasons for this action<br>

At our more leysure, shall I render you;<br>

Onely, this one: Lord Angelo is precise,<br>

Stands at a guard with Enuie: scarce confesses<br>

That his blood flowes: or that his appetite<br>

Is more to bread then stone: hence shall we see<br>

If power change purpose: what our Seemers be.<br>

You may; I may not: you are yet vnsworne:<br>

When you haue vowd, you must not speake with men,<br>

But in the presence of the Prioresse;<br>

The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;<br>

Bore many gentlemen (my selfe being one)<br>

In hand, and hope of action: but we doe learne,<br>

By those that know the very Nerues of State,<br>

His giuing-out, were of an infinite distance<br>

From his true meant designe: vpon his place,<br>

(And with full line of his authority)<br>

Gouernes Lord Angelo; A man, whose blood<br>

Is very snow-broth: one, who neuer feeles<br>

The wanton stings, and motions of the sence;<br>

But doth rebate, and blunt his naturall edge<br>

With profits of the minde: Studie, and fast<br>

He (to giue feare to vse, and libertie,<br>

Which haue, for long, run-by the hideous law,<br>

As Myce, by Lyons) hath pickt out an act,<br>

Vnder whose heauy sence, your brothers life<br>

Christians ought to haue</p><br>

China-dishes, but very good dishes</p><br>

longing (as I said) for prewyns: and hauing but two in
the dish (as I said) Master Froth here, this very man, hauing

thing about him, how could Master Froth doe the Constables
wife any harme? I would know that of your
honour</p><br>

<p id="id02619">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. He's in the right (Constable) what say you to it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Elb. First, and it like you, the house is a respected<br>

house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his Mistris is<br>

a respected woman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02620">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. By this hand Sir, his wife is a more respected person<br>

then any of vs all<br>

<p id="id02623"> Esc. Which is the wiser here; Iustice or Iniquitie? Is
this true?
 Elb. O thou caytiffe: O thou varlet: O thou wicked

<p id="id02637"> Clo. Truly sir, I am a poore fellow that would liue</p><br>

what doe you thinke of the trade Pompey? is it a lawfull<br>

trade?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. If the Law would allow it, sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02639">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. But the Law will not allow it Pompey; nor it<br>

shall not be allowed in Vienna<br>

the youth of the City?<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id02641"> Clo. Truely Sir, in my poore opinion they will too't

the knaues, you need not to feare the bawds</p><br>

<p id="id02642">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. There is pretty orders beginning I can tell you:<br>

told you so</p><br>

your prophesie, harke you: I aduise you let me not finde
you before me againe vpon any complaint whatsoeuer;
no, not for dwelling where you doe: if I doe Pompey, I
shall beat you to your Tent, and proue a shrewd C??sar
to you: in plaine dealing Pompey, I shall haue you whipt;
so for this time, Pompey, fare you well</p><br>

<p id="id02645"> Clo. I thanke your Worship for your good counsell;

determine. Whip me? no, no, let Carman whip his Iade,
The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.</p><br>

Liues not to act another. Be satisfied;<br>

Your Brother dies to morrow; be content<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02698">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. So you must be y first that giues this sentence,<br>

And hee, that suffers: Oh, it is excellent<br>

To haue a Giants strength: but it is tyrannous<br>

To vse it like a Giant<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02699"> Luc. That's well said</p><br>

<p id="id02700">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Could great men thunder<br>

As Ioue himselfe do's, Ioue would neuer be quiet,<br>

For euery pelting petty Officer<br>

Would vse his heauen for thunder;<br>

Nothing but thunder: Mercifull heauen,<br>

Thou rather with thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt<br>

Splits the vn-wedgable and gnarled Oke,<br>

Then the soft Mertill: But man, proud man,<br>

Drest in a little briefe authoritie,<br>

Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,<br>

(His glassie Essence) like an angry Ape<br>

Plaies such phantastique tricks before high heauen,<br>

As makes the Angels weepe: who with our spleenes,<br>

Would all themselues laugh mortall<br>

<p id="id02701">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Oh, to him, to him wench: he will relent,<br>

<p id="id02707">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Why doe you put these sayings vpon me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Because Authoritie, though it erre like others,<br>

Hath yet a kinde of medicine in it selfe<br>

That skins the vice o'th top; goe to your bosome,<br>

Knock there, and aske your heart what it doth know<br>

That's like my brothers fault: if it confesse<br>

A naturall guiltinesse, such as is his,<br>

Let it not sound a thought vpon your tongue<br>

Against my brothers life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02708">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Shee speakes, and 'tis such sence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Is. I, with such gifts that heauen shall share with you<br>

<p id="id02713"> Luc. You had mar'd all else</p><br>

<p id="id02714">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Not with fond Sickles of the tested-gold,<br>

Or Stones, whose rate are either rich, or poore<br>

As fancie values them: but with true prayers,<br>

That shall be vp at heauen, and enter there<br>

Ere Sunne rise: prayers from preserued soules,<br>

From fasting Maides, whose mindes are dedicate<br>

To nothing temporall<br>

For I am that way going to temptation,<br>

Where prayers crosse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02719">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. At what hower to morrow,<br>

Shall I attend your Lordship?<br>

<p id="id02720"> Isab. 'Saue your Honour</p><br>

What's this? what's this? is this her fault, or mine?<br>

The Tempter, or the Tempted, who sins most? ha?<br>

Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I,<br>

That, lying by the Violet in the Sunne,<br>

Doe as the Carrion do's, not as the flowre,<br>

Corrupt with vertuous season: Can it be,<br>

That Modesty may more betray our Sence<br>

Then womans lightnesse? hauing waste ground enough,<br>

Shall we desire to raze the Sanctuary<br>

And pitch our euils there? oh fie, fie, fie:<br>

What dost thou? or what art thou Angelo?<br>

Dost thou desire her fowly, for those things<br>

That make her good? oh, let her brother liue:<br>

Theeues for their robbery haue authority,<br>

When Iudges steale themselues: what, doe I loue her,<br>

That I desire to heare her speake againe?<br>

And feast vpon her eyes? what is't I dreame on?<br>

Oh cunning enemy, that to catch a Saint,<br>

With Saints dost bait thy hooke: most dangerous<br>

Is that temptation, that doth goad vs on<br>

To sinne, in louing vertue: neuer could the Strumpet<br>

With all her double vigor, Art, and Nature<br>

Once stir my temper: but this vertuous Maid<br>

Subdues me quite: Euer till now<br>

Giue vp your body to such sweet vncleannesse<br>

Against the thing I say: Answere to this,<br>

I (now the voyce of the recorded Law)<br>

Pronounce a sentence on your Brothers life,<br>

Might there not be a charitie in sinne,<br>

To saue this Brothers life?<br>

It is no sinne at all, but charitie<br>

Heauen let me beare it: you granting of my suit,<br>

To haue it added to the faults of mine,<br>

And nothing of your answere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02765">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Nay, but heare me,<br>

Your sence pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,<br>

Or seeme so crafty; and that's not good<br>

<p id="id02766">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Let be ignorant, and in nothing good,<br>

But graciously to know I am no better<br>

Your Brother is to dye<br>

Accountant to the Law, vpon that paine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02770"> Isab. True</p><br>

<p id="id02771">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Admit no other way to saue his life<br>

Finding your selfe desir'd of such a person,<br>

Whose creadit with the Iudge, or owne great place,<br>

Could fetch your Brother from the Manacles<br>

Of the all-building-Law: and that there were<br>

No earthly meane to saue him, but that either<br>

You must lay downe the treasures of your body,<br>

To this supposed, or else to let him suffer:<br>

What would you doe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. As much for my poore Brother, as my selfe;<br>

That is: were I vnder the tearmes of death,<br>

Th' impression of keene whips, I'ld weare as Rubies,<br>

And strip my selfe to death, as to a bed,<br>

That longing haue bin sicke for, ere I'ld yeeld<br>

My body vp to shame<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02772"> Ang. Then must your brother die</p><br>

<p id="id02773">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. And 'twer the cheaper way:<br>

Better it were a brother dide at once,<br>

Then that a sister, by redeeming him<br>

Should die for euer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02774">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Were not you then as cruell as the Sentence,<br>

That you haue slander'd so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Ignomie in ransome, and free pardon<br>

Are of two houses: lawfull mercie,<br>

Is nothing kin to fowle redemption<br>

<p id="id02775">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. You seem'd of late to make the Law a tirant,<br>

And rather prou'd the sliding of your brother<br>

A merriment, then a vice<br>

<p id="id02776">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Oh pardon me my Lord, it oft fals out<br>

Women? Helpe heauen; men their creation marre<br>

In profiting by them: Nay, call vs ten times fraile,<br>

For we are soft, as our complexions are,<br>

And credulous to false prints<br>

<p id="id02781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. I thinke it well:<br>

And from this testimonie of your owne sex<br>

(Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger<br>

Then faults may shake our frames) let me be bold;<br>

I do arrest your words. Be that you are,<br>

That is a woman; if you be more, you'r none.<br>

If you be one (as you are well exprest<br>

By all externall warrants) shew it now,<br>

By putting on the destin'd Liuerie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. I haue no tongue but one; gentle my Lord,<br>

Let me entreate you speake the former language<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02783"> Ang. Plainlie conceiue I loue you</p><br>

<p id="id02784">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. My brother did loue Iuliet,<br>

And you tell me that he shall die for't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02785"> Ang. He shall not Isabell if you giue me loue</p><br>

<p id="id02786">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. I know your vertue hath a licence in't,<br>

Which seemes a little fouler then it is,<br>

To plucke on others<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02787">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Beleeue me on mine Honor,<br>

My words expresse my purpose<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02788">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Ha? Little honor, to be much beleeu'd,<br>

And most pernitious purpose: Seeming, seeming.<br>

I will proclaime thee Angelo, looke for't.<br>

Signe me a present pardon for my brother,<br>

Or with an out-stretcht throate Ile tell the world aloud<br>

What man thou art<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02789">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Who will beleeue thee Isabell?<br>

My vnsoild name, th' austeerenesse of my life,<br>

My vouch against you, and my place i'th State,<br>

Will so your accusation ouer-weigh,<br>

That you shall stifle in your owne report,<br>

And smell of calumnie. I haue begun,<br>

And now I giue my sensuall race, the reine,<br>

Fit thy consent to my sharpe appetite,<br>

Lay by all nicetie, and prolixious blushes<br>

That banish what they sue for: Redeeme thy brother,<br>

By yeelding vp thy bodie to my will,<br>

Or else he must not onelie die the death,<br>

But thy vnkindnesse shall his death draw out<br>

To lingring sufferance: Answer me to morrow,<br>

Or by the affection that now guides me most,<br>

Ile proue a Tirant to him. As for you,<br>

Say what you can; my false, ore-weighs your true.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02790">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id02791">&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. To whom should I complaine? Did I tell this,<br>

Who would beleeue me? O perilous mouthes<br>

That beare in them, one and the selfesame tongue,<br>

Either of condemnation, or approofe,<br>

Bidding the Law make curtsie to their will,<br>

Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,<br>

To follow as it drawes. Ile to my brother,<br>

Though he hath falne by prompture of the blood,<br>

Yet hath he in him such a minde of Honor,<br>

That had he twentie heads to tender downe<br>

On twentie bloodie blockes, hee'ld yeeld them vp,<br>

Before his sister should her bodie stoope<br>

To such abhord pollution.<br>

Then Isabell liue chaste, and brother die;<br>

``More then our Brother, is our Chastitie.<br>

If I do loose thee, I do loose a thing<br>

That none but fooles would keepe: a breath thou art,<br>

Seruile to all the skyie-influences<br>

That dost this habitation where thou keepst<br>

Hourely afflict: Meerely, thou art deaths foole,<br>

For him thou labourst by thy flight to shun,<br>

For all th' accommodations that thou bearst,<br>

Are nurst by basenesse: Thou'rt by no meanes valiant,<br>

For thou dost feare the soft and tender forke<br>

Of a poore worme: thy best of rest is sleepe,<br>

That issue out of dust. Happie thou art not,<br>

For what thou hast not, still thou striu'st to get,<br>

And what thou hast forgetst. Thou art not certaine,<br>

For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,<br>

After the Moone: If thou art rich, thou'rt poore,<br>

For like an Asse, whose backe with Ingots bowes;<br>

Thou bearst thy heauie riches but a iournie,<br>

And death vnloads thee; Friend hast thou none.<br>

For thine owne bowels which do call thee, fire<br>

The meere effusion of thy proper loines<br>

Do curse the Gowt, Sapego, and the Rheume<br>

For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth, nor age<br>

But as it were an after-dinners sleepe<br>

Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth<br>

Becomes as aged, and doth begge the almes<br>

Of palsied-Eld: and when thou art old, and rich<br>

Thou hast neither heate, affection, limbe, nor beautie<br>

To make thy riches pleasant: what's yet in this<br>

welcome</p><br>

<p id="id02801"> Duke. Deere sir, ere long Ile visit you againe</p><br>

<p id="id02802"> Cla. Most holie Sir, I thanke you</p><br>

<p id="id02803"> Isa. My businesse is a word or two with Claudio</p><br>

<p id="id02804" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pro. And verie welcom: looke Signior, here's your
sister</p><br>

<p id="id02805"> Duke. Prouost, a word with you</p><br>

<p id="id02806"> Pro. As manie as you please</p><br>

<p id="id02807">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Bring them to heare me speak, where I may be<br>

conceal'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02808">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Now sister, what's the comfort?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Why,<br>

As all comforts are: most good, most good indeede,<br>

Lord Angelo hauing affaires to heauen<br>

Intends you for his swift Ambassador,<br>

Where you shall be an euerlasting Leiger;<br>

Therefore your best appointment make with speed,<br>

To Morrow you set on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02809">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Is there no remedie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. None, but such remedie, as to saue a head<br>

To cleaue a heart in twaine:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. But is there anie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Yes brother, you may liue;<br>

There is a diuellish mercie in the Iudge,<br>

If you'l implore it, that will free your life,<br>

But fetter you till death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02810">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Perpetuall durance?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. I iust, perpetuall durance, a restraint<br>

Through all the worlds vastiditie you had<br>

To a determin'd scope<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02811">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. But in what nature?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. In such a one, as you consenting too't,<br>

Would barke your honor from that trunke you beare,<br>

And leaue you naked<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02812"> Clau. Let me know the point</p><br>

<p id="id02813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Oh, I do feare thee Claudio, and I quake,<br>

Least thou a feauorous life shouldst entertaine,<br>

And six or seuen winters more respect<br>

Then a perpetuall Honor. Dar'st thou die?<br>

The sence of death is most in apprehension,<br>

And the poore Beetle that we treade vpon<br>

In corporall sufferance, finds a pang as great,<br>

As when a Giant dies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02814">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Why giue you me this shame?<br>

Thinke you I can a resolution fetch<br>

From flowrie tendernesse? If I must die,<br>

I will encounter darknesse as a bride,<br>

And hugge it in mine armes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02815">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. There spake my brother: there my fathers graue<br>

Did vtter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:<br>

Thou art too noble, to conserue a life<br>

In base appliances. This outward sainted Deputie,<br>

Whose setled visage, and deliberate word<br>

Nips youth i'th head, and follies doth emmew<br>

As Falcon doth the Fowle, is yet a diuell:<br>

His filth within being cast, he would appeare<br>

A pond, as deepe as hell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02816">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. The prenzie, Angelo?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Oh 'tis the cunning Liuerie of hell,<br>

The damnest bodie to inuest, and couer<br>

In prenzie gardes; dost thou thinke Claudio,<br>

If I would yeeld him my virginitie<br>

Thou might'st be freed?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Oh heauens, it cannot be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Yes, he would giu't thee; from this rank offence<br>

So to offend him still. This night's the time<br>

That I should do what I abhorre to name,<br>

Or else thou diest to morrow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02818"> Clau. Thou shalt not do't</p><br>

<p id="id02819">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. O, were it but my life,<br>

I'de throw it downe for your deliuerance<br>

As frankely as a pin<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02820"> Clau. Thankes deere Isabell</p><br>

<p id="id02821"> Isa. Be readie Claudio, for your death to morrow</p><br>

<p id="id02822">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Yes. Has he affections in him,<br>

That thus can make him bite the Law by th' nose,<br>

When he would force it? Sure it is no sinne,<br>

Or of the deadly seuen it is the least<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02823">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Which is the least?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. If it were damnable, he being so wise,<br>

Why would he for the momentarie tricke<br>

Be perdurablie fin'de? Oh Isabell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02824">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. What saies my brother?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Death is a fearefull thing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02825"> Isa. And shamed life, a hatefull</p><br>

<p id="id02826">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. I, but to die, and go we know not where,<br>

To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot,<br>

This sensible warme motion, to become<br>

A kneaded clod; And the delighted spirit<br>

To bath in fierie floods, or to recide<br>

In thrilling Region of thicke-ribbed Ice,<br>

To be imprison'd in the viewlesse windes<br>

And blowne with restlesse violence round about<br>

The pendant world: or to be worse then worst<br>

Of those, that lawlesse and incertaine thought,<br>

Imagine howling, 'tis too horrible.<br>

The weariest, and most loathed worldly life<br>

That Age, Ache, periury, and imprisonment<br>

Can lay on nature, is a Paradise<br>

To what we feare of death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02827"> Isa. Alas, alas</p><br>

<p id="id02828">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Sweet Sister, let me liue.<br>

What sinne you do, to saue a brothers life,<br>

Nature dispenses with the deede so farre,<br>

That it becomes a vertue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02829">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Oh you beast,<br>

Oh faithlesse Coward, oh dishonest wretch,<br>

Wilt thou be made a man, out of my vice?<br>

Is't not a kinde of Incest, to take life<br>

From thine owne sisters shame? What should I thinke,<br>

Heauen shield my Mother plaid my Father faire:<br>

For such a warped slip of wildernesse<br>

Nere issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance,<br>

Die, perish: Might but my bending downe<br>

Repreeue thee from thy fate, it should proceede.<br>

Ile pray a thousand praiers for thy death,<br>

No word to saue thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02830"> Cla. Nay heare me Isabell</p><br>

<p id="id02831">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Oh fie, fie, fie:<br>

Thy sinn's not accidentall, but a Trade;<br>

Mercy to thee would proue it selfe a Bawd,<br>

'Tis best that thou diest quickly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02832"> Cla. Oh heare me Isabella</p><br>

<p id="id02833"> Duk. Vouchsafe a word, yong sister, but one word</p><br>

<p id="id02834"> Isa. What is your Will</p><br>

<p id="id02835"> Duk. Might you dispense with your leysure, I would
by and by haue some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require, is likewise your owne benefit</p><br>

<p id="id02836" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Isa. I haue no superfluous leysure, my stay must be
stolen out of other affaires: but I will attend you a while</p><br>

<p id="id02837"> Duke. Son, I haue ouer-heard what hath past between
you &amp; your sister. Angelo had neuer the purpose to corrupt
her; onely he hath made an assay of her vertue, to
practise his iudgement with the disposition of natures.
She (hauing the truth of honour in her) hath made him
that gracious deniall, which he is most glad to receiue: I
am Confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true, therfore
prepare your selfe to death: do not satisfie your resolution
with hopes that are fallible, to morrow you
must die, goe to your knees, and make ready</p><br>

<p id="id02838">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Let me ask my sister pardon, I am so out of loue<br>

with life, that I will sue to be rid of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02839">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Hold you there: farewell: Prouost, a word<br>

with you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02840">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. What's your will (father?)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. That now you are come, you wil be gone: leaue<br>

me a while with the Maid, my minde promises with my<br>

habit, no losse shall touch her by my company<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02841"> Pro. In good time.</p><br>

<p id="id02842">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id02843"> Duk. The hand that hath made you faire, hath made
you good: the goodnes that is cheape in beauty, makes
beauty briefe in goodnes; but grace being the soule of
your complexion, shall keepe the body of it euer faire:
the assault that Angelo hath made to you, Fortune hath
conuaid to my vnderstanding; and but that frailty hath
examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo: how
will you doe to content this Substitute, and to saue your
Brother?
 Isab. I am now going to resolue him: I had rather
my brother die by the Law, then my sonne should be vnlawfullie
borne. But (oh) how much is the good Duke
deceiu'd in Angelo: if euer he returne, and I can speake
to him, I will open my lips in vaine, or discouer his gouernment</p><br>

<p id="id02844"> Duke. That shall not be much amisse: yet, as the matter
now stands, he will auoid your accusation: he made
triall of you onelie. Therefore fasten your eare on my
aduisings, to the loue I haue in doing good; a remedie
presents it selfe. I doe make my selfe beleeue that you
may most vprighteously do a poor wronged Lady a merited
benefit; redeem your brother from the angry Law;
doe no staine to your owne gracious person, and much
please the absent Duke, if peraduenture he shall euer returne
to haue hearing of this businesse</p><br>

<p id="id02845"> Isab. Let me heare you speake farther; I haue spirit to
do any thing that appeares not fowle in the truth of my
spirit</p><br>

<p id="id02846"> Duke. Vertue is bold, and goodnes neuer fearefull:
Haue you not heard speake of Mariana the sister of Fredericke
the great Souldier, who miscarried at Sea?
 Isa. I haue heard of the Lady, and good words went
with her name</p><br>

<p id="id02847"> Duke. Shee should this Angelo haue married: was affianced
to her oath, and the nuptiall appointed: between
which time of the contract, and limit of the solemnitie,
her brother Fredericke was wrackt at Sea, hauing in that
perished vessell, the dowry of his sister: but marke how
heauily this befell to the poore Gentlewoman, there she
lost a noble and renowned brother, in his loue toward
her, euer most kinde and naturall: with him the portion
and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry: with
both, her combynate-husband, this well-seeming
Angelo</p><br>

<p id="id02848"> Isab. Can this be so? did Angelo so leaue her?
 Duke. Left her in her teares, &amp; dried not one of them
with his comfort: swallowed his vowes whole, pretending
in her, discoueries of dishonor: in few, bestow'd
her on her owne lamentation, which she yet weares for
his sake: and he, a marble to her teares, is washed with
them, but relents not</p><br>

<p id="id02849"> Isab. What a merit were it in death to take this poore
maid from the world? what corruption in this life, that
it will let this man liue? But how out of this can shee auaile?
 Duke. It is a rupture that you may easily heale: and the
cure of it not onely saues your brother, but keepes you
from dishonor in doing it</p><br>

<p id="id02850"> Isab. Shew me how (good Father.)
 Duk. This fore-named Maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his vniust vnkindenesse
(that in all reason should haue quenched her loue) hath
(like an impediment in the Current) made it more violent
and vnruly: Goe you to Angelo, answere his requiring
with a plausible obedience, agree with his demands
to the point: onely referre your selfe to this aduantage;
first, that your stay with him may not be long: that the
time may haue all shadow, and silence in it: and the place
answere to conuenience: this being granted in course,
and now followes all: wee shall aduise this wronged
maid to steed vp your appointment, goe in your place:
if the encounter acknowledge it selfe heereafter, it may
compell him to her recompence; and heere, by this is
your brother saued, your honor vntainted, the poore
Mariana aduantaged, and the corrupt Deputy scaled.
The Maid will I frame, and make fit for his attempt: if
you thinke well to carry this as you may, the doublenes
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproofe. What
thinke you of it?
 Isab. The image of it giues me content already, and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection</p><br>

<p id="id02851"> Duk. It lies much in your holding vp: haste you speedily
to Angelo, if for this night he intreat you to his bed,
giue him promise of satisfaction: I will presently to S[aint].
Lukes, there at the moated-Grange recides this deiected
Mariana; at that place call vpon me, and dispatch
with Angelo, that it may be quickly</p><br>

<p id="id02852" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Isab. I thank you for this comfort: fare you well good
father.</p><br>

<p id="id02853">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id02854">Enter Elbow, Clowne, Officers.</p><br>

<p id="id02855"> Elb. Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you
will needes buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall haue all the world drinke browne &amp; white bastard</p><br>

<p id="id02856"> Duk. Oh heauens, what stuffe is heere</p><br>

<p id="id02857"> Clow. Twas neuer merry world since of two vsuries
the merriest was put downe, and the worser allow'd by
order of Law; a fur'd gowne to keepe him warme; and
furd with Foxe and Lamb-skins too, to signifie, that craft
being richer then Innocency, stands for the facing</p><br>

<p id="id02858">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elb. Come your way sir: 'blesse you good Father<br>

Frier<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02859"> Duk. And you good Brother Father; what offence
hath this man made you, Sir?
 Elb. Marry Sir, he hath offended the Law; and Sir,
we take him to be a Theefe too Sir: for wee haue found
vpon him Sir, a strange Pick-lock, which we haue sent
to the Deputie</p><br>

<p id="id02860">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Fie, sirrah, a Bawd, a wicked bawd,<br>

The euill that thou causest to be done,<br>

That is thy meanes to liue. Do thou but thinke<br>

What 'tis to cram a maw, or cloath a backe<br>

From such a filthie vice: say to thy selfe,<br>

From their abhominable and beastly touches<br>

I drinke, I eate away my selfe, and liue:<br>

Canst thou beleeue thy liuing is a life,<br>

So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02861">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Indeed, it do's stinke in some sort, Sir:<br>

But yet Sir I would proue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02862">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Nay, if the diuell haue giuen thee proofs for sin<br>

Thou wilt proue his. Take him to prison Officer:<br>

Correction, and Instruction must both worke<br>

Ere this rude beast will profit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02863"> Elb. He must before the Deputy Sir, he ha's giuen
him warning: the Deputy cannot abide a Whore-master:
if he be a Whore-monger, and comes before him,
he were as good go a mile on his errand</p><br>

<p id="id02864">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. That we were all, as some would seeme to bee<br>

From our faults, as faults from seeming free.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02865">Enter Lucio.</p><br>

<p id="id02866"> Elb. His necke will come to your wast, a Cord sir</p><br>

<p id="id02867" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. I spy comfort, I cry baile: Here's a Gentleman,
and a friend of mine</p><br>

<p id="id02868"> Luc. How now noble Pompey? What, at the wheels
of C??sar? Art thou led in triumph? What is there none
of Pigmalions Images newly made woman to bee had
now, for putting the hand in the pocket, and extracting
clutch'd? What reply? Ha? What saist thou to this
Tune, Matter, and Method? Is't not drown'd i'th last
raine? Ha? What saist thou Trot? Is the world as it was
Man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words?
Or how? The tricke of it?
 Duke. Still thus, and thus: still worse?
 Luc. How doth my deere Morsell, thy Mistris? Procures
she still? Ha?
 Clo. Troth sir, shee hath eaten vp all her beefe, and
she is her selfe in the tub</p><br>

<p id="id02869"> Luc. Why 'tis good: It is the right of it: it must be
so. Euer your fresh Whore, and your pouder'd Baud, an
vnshun'd consequence, it must be so. Art going to prison
Pompey?
 Clo. Yes faith sir</p><br>

<p id="id02870">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Why 'tis not amisse Pompey: farewell: goe say<br>

I sent thee thether: for debt Pompey? Or how?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Elb. For being a baud, for being a baud<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02871"> Luc. Well, then imprison him: If imprisonment be
the due of a baud, why 'tis his right. Baud is he doubtlesse,
and of antiquity too: Baud borne. Farwell good
Pompey: Commend me to the prison Pompey, you will
turne good husband now Pompey, you will keepe the
house</p><br>

<p id="id02872">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I hope Sir, your good Worship wil be my baile?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. No indeed wil I not Pompey, it is not the wear:<br>

I will pray (Pompey) to encrease your bondage if you<br>

take it not patiently: Why, your mettle is the more:<br>

Adieu trustie Pompey.<br>

Blesse you Friar<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02873"> Duke. And you</p><br>

<p id="id02874">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Do's Bridget paint still, Pompey? Ha?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Elb. Come your waies sir, come<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02875">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. You will not baile me then Sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Then Pompey, nor now: what newes abroad Frier?<br>

What newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Elb. Come your waies sir, come<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02876">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Goe to kennell (Pompey) goe:<br>

What newes Frier of the Duke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I know none: can you tell me of any?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia: other<br>

some, he is in Rome: but where is he thinke you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I know not where: but wheresoeuer, I wish<br>

him well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02877"> Luc. It was a mad fantasticall tricke of him to steale
from the State, and vsurpe the beggerie hee was neuer
borne to: Lord Angelo Dukes it well in his absence: he
puts transgression too't</p><br>

<p id="id02878"> Duke. He do's well in't</p><br>

<p id="id02879" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Luc. A little more lenitie to Lecherie would doe no
harme in him: Something too crabbed that way, Frier</p><br>

<p id="id02880"> Duk. It is too general a vice, and seueritie must cure it</p><br>

<p id="id02881"> Luc. Yes in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirpe it quite,
Frier, till eating and drinking be put downe. They say
this Angelo was not made by Man and Woman, after
this downe-right way of Creation: is it true, thinke
you?
 Duke. How should he be made then?
 Luc. Some report, a Sea-maid spawn'd him. Some,
that he was begot betweene two Stock-fishes. But it
is certaine, that when he makes water, his Vrine is congeal'd
ice, that I know to bee true: and he is a motion
generatiue, that's infallible</p><br>

<p id="id02882"> Duke. You are pleasant sir, and speake apace</p><br>

<p id="id02883"> Luc. Why, what a ruthlesse thing is this in him, for
the rebellion of a Cod-peece, to take away the life of a
man? Would the Duke that is absent haue done this?
Ere he would haue hang'd a man for the getting a hundred
Bastards, he would haue paide for the Nursing a
thousand. He had some feeling of the sport, hee knew
the seruice, and that instructed him to mercie</p><br>

<p id="id02884" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Duke. I neuer heard the absent Duke much detected
for Women, he was not enclin'd that way</p><br>

<p id="id02885"> Luc. Oh Sir, you are deceiu'd</p><br>

<p id="id02886"> Duke. 'Tis not possible</p><br>

<p id="id02887"> Luc. Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty:
and his vse was, to put a ducket in her Clack-dish; the
Duke had Crochets in him. Hee would be drunke too,
that let me informe you</p><br>

<p id="id02888"> Duke. You do him wrong, surely</p><br>

<p id="id02889" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Luc. Sir, I was an inward of his: a shie fellow was
the Duke, and I beleeue I know the cause of his withdrawing</p><br>

<p id="id02890"> Duke. What (I prethee) might be the cause?
 Luc. No, pardon: 'Tis a secret must bee lockt within
the teeth and the lippes: but this I can let you vnderstand,
the greater file of the subiect held the Duke to be
wise</p><br>

<p id="id02891"> Duke. Wise? Why no question but he was</p><br>

<p id="id02892"> Luc. A very superficiall, ignorant, vnweighing fellow
 Duke. Either this is Enuie in you, Folly, or mistaking:
The very streame of his life, and the businesse he
hath helmed, must vppon a warranted neede, giue him
a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in
his owne bringings forth, and hee shall appeare to the
enuious, a Scholler, a Statesman, and a Soldier: therefore
you speake vnskilfully: or, if your knowledge bee
more, it is much darkned in your malice</p><br>

<p id="id02893"> Luc. Sir, I know him, and I loue him</p><br>

<p id="id02894" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Duke. Loue talkes with better knowledge, &amp; knowledge
with deare loue</p><br>

<p id="id02895"> Luc. Come Sir, I know what I know</p><br>

<p id="id02896"> Duke. I can hardly beleeue that, since you know not
what you speake. But if euer the Duke returne (as our
praiers are he may) let mee desire you to make your answer
before him: if it bee honest you haue spoke, you
haue courage to maintaine it; I am bound to call vppon
you, and I pray you your name?
 Luc. Sir my name is Lucio, wel known to the Duke</p><br>

<p id="id02897">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. He shall know you better Sir, if I may liue to<br>

report you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02898"> Luc. I feare you not</p><br>

<p id="id02899"> Duke. O, you hope the Duke will returne no more:
or you imagine me to vnhurtfull an opposite: but indeed
I can doe you little harme: You'll for-sweare this againe?
 Luc. Ile be hang'd first: Thou art deceiu'd in mee
Friar. But no more of this: Canst thou tell if Claudio
die to morrow, or no?
 Duke. Why should he die Sir?
 Luc. Why? For filling a bottle with a Tunne-dish:
I would the Duke we talke of were return'd againe: this
vngenitur'd Agent will vn-people the Prouince with
Continencie. Sparrowes must not build in his house-eeues,
because they are lecherous: The Duke yet would
haue darke deeds darkelie answered, hee would neuer
bring them to light: would hee were return'd. Marrie
this Claudio is condemned for vntrussing. Farwell good
Friar, I prethee pray for me: The Duke (I say to thee
againe) would eate Mutton on Fridaies. He's now past
it, yet (and I say to thee) hee would mouth with a beggar,
though she smelt browne-bread and Garlicke: say
that I said so: Farewell.</p><br>

<p id="id02901">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. No might, nor greatnesse in mortality<br>

Can censure scape: Back-wounding calumnie<br>

The whitest vertue strikes. What King so strong,<br>

Can tie the gall vp in the slanderous tong?<br>

But who comes heere?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02902">Enter Escalus, Prouost, and Bawd.</p><br>

<p id="id02903"> Esc. Go, away with her to prison</p><br>

<p id="id02904" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bawd. Good my Lord be good to mee, your Honor
is accounted a mercifull man: good my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id02905"> Esc. Double, and trebble admonition, and still forfeite
in the same kinde? This would make mercy sweare
and play the Tirant</p><br>

<p id="id02906" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pro. A Bawd of eleuen yeares continuance, may it
please your Honor</p><br>

<p id="id02907"> Bawd. My Lord, this is one Lucio's information against
me, Mistris Kate Keepe-downe was with childe by
him in the Dukes time, he promis'd her marriage: his
Childe is a yeere and a quarter olde come Philip and Iacob:
I haue kept it my selfe; and see how hee goes about
to abuse me</p><br>

<p id="id02908"> Esc. That fellow is a fellow of much License: Let
him be call'd before vs, Away with her to prison: Goe
too, no more words. Prouost, my Brother Angelo will
not be alter'd, Claudio must die to morrow: Let him be
furnish'd with Diuines, and haue all charitable preparation.
If my brother wrought by my pitie, it should not
be so with him</p><br>

<p id="id02909" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pro. So please you, this Friar hath beene with him,
and aduis'd him for th' entertainment of death</p><br>

<p id="id02910"> Esc. Good' euen, good Father</p><br>

<p id="id02911"> Duke. Blisse, and goodnesse on you</p><br>

<p id="id02912">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. Of whence are you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Not of this Countrie, though my chance is now<br>

To vse it for my time: I am a brother<br>

Of gracious Order, late come from the Sea,<br>

In speciall businesse from his Holinesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02913"> Esc. What newes abroad i'th World?
 Duke. None, but that there is so great a Feauor on
goodnesse, that the dissolution of it must cure it. Noueltie
is onely in request, and as it is as dangerous to be
aged in any kinde of course, as it is vertuous to be constant
in any vndertaking. There is scarse truth enough
aliue to make Societies secure, but Securitie enough to
make Fellowships accurst: Much vpon this riddle runs
the wisedome of the world: This newes is old enough,
yet it is euerie daies newes. I pray you Sir, of what disposition
was the Duke?
 Esc. One, that aboue all other strifes,
Contended especially to know himselfe</p><br>

<p id="id02914"> Duke. What pleasure was he giuen to?
 Esc. Rather reioycing to see another merry, then
merrie at anie thing which profest to make him reioice.
A Gentleman of all temperance. But leaue wee him to
his euents, with a praier they may proue prosperous, &amp;
let me desire to know, how you finde Claudio prepar'd?
I am made to vnderstand, that you haue lent him visitation</p><br>

<p id="id02915"> Duke. He professes to haue receiued no sinister measure
from his Iudge, but most willingly humbles himselfe
to the determination of Iustice: yet had he framed
to himselfe (by the instruction of his frailty) manie deceyuing
promises of life, which I (by my good leisure)
haue discredited to him, and now is he resolu'd to die</p><br>

<p id="id02916"> Esc. You haue paid the heauens your Function, and
the prisoner the verie debt of your Calling. I haue labour'd
for the poore Gentleman, to the extremest shore
of my modestie, but my brother-Iustice haue I found so
seuere, that he hath forc'd me to tell him, hee is indeede
Iustice</p><br>

<p id="id02917">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. If his owne life,<br>

Answere the straitnesse of his proceeding,<br>

It shall become him well: wherein if he chance to faile<br>

he hath sentenc'd himselfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02918"> Esc I am going to visit the prisoner, Fare you well</p><br>

<p id="id02919">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Peace be with you.<br>

He who the sword of Heauen will beare,<br>

Should be as holy, as seueare:<br>

Patterne in himselfe to know,<br>

Grace to stand, and Vertue go:<br>

More, nor lesse to others paying,<br>

Then by selfe-offences weighing.<br>

Shame to him, whose cruell striking,<br>

Kils for faults of his owne liking:<br>

Twice trebble shame on Angelo,<br>

To weede my vice, and let his grow.<br>

Oh, what may Man within him hide,<br>

Though Angel on the outward side?<br>

How may likenesse made in crimes,<br>

Making practise on the Times,<br>

To draw with ydle Spiders strings<br>

Most ponderous and substantiall things?<br>

Craft against vice, I must applie.<br>

With Angelo to night shall lye<br>

His old betroathed (but despised:)<br>

So disguise shall by th' disguised<br>

Pay with falshood, false exacting,<br>

And performe an olde contracting.<br>

<p id="id02955"> Pro. Come sir, leaue me your snatches, and yeeld mee

who in his office lacks a helper, if you will take
it on you to assist him, it shall redeeme you from your

I would bee glad to receiue some instruction from

 Pro. Sirha, here's a fellow will helpe you to morrow
in your execution: if you thinke it meet, compound with
him by the yeere, and let him abide here with you, if not,
vse him for the present, and dismisse him, hee cannot
plead his estimation with you: he hath beene a Bawd</p><br>

<p id="id02960">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abh. A Bawd Sir? fie vpon him, he will discredit our<br>

mysterie<br>

<p id="id02961">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Goe too Sir, you waigh equallie: a feather will<br>

turne the Scale.<br>

your Whores sir, being members of my occupation, vsing

<p id="id02965"> Abh. Sir, it is a Misterie</p><br>

<p id="id02969">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Are you agreed?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Sir, I will serue him: For I do finde your Hangman<br>

oftner aske forgiuenesse<br>

Th' one has my pitie; not a iot the other,<br>

'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to morrow<br>

Well, go, prepare your selfe. But harke, what noise?<br>

Heauen giue your spirits comfort: by, and by,<br>

I hope it is some pardon, or repreeue<br>

For the most gentle Claudio. Welcome Father.<br>

<p id="id02978">Enter Duke.</p><br>

<p id="id02979">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. The best, and wholsomst spirits of the night,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. None since the Curphew rung<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02980">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Not Isabell?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. No<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02981"> Duke. They will then er't be long</p><br>

<p id="id02982">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. What comfort is for Claudio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. There's some in hope<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02983"> Pro. It is a bitter Deputie</p><br>

<p id="id02984">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Not so, not so: his life is paralel'd<br>

Euen with the stroke and line of his great Iustice:<br>

He doth with holie abstinence subdue<br>

That in himselfe, which he spurres on his powre<br>

To qualifie in others: were he meal'd with that<br>

Which he corrects, then were he tirrannous,<br>

But this being so, he's iust. Now are they come.<br>

This is a gentle Prouost, sildome when<br>

The steeled Gaoler is the friend of men:<br>

How now? what noise? That spirit's possest with hast,<br>

That wounds th' vnsisting Posterne with these strokes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02985">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. There he must stay vntil the Officer<br>

Arise to let him in: he is call'd vp<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02986">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Haue you no countermand for Claudio yet?<br>

But he must die to morrow?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. None Sir, none<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02987">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. As neere the dawning Prouost, as it is,<br>

You shall heare more ere Morning<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02988">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Happely<br>

You something know: yet I beleeue there comes<br>

No countermand: no such example haue we:<br>

Besides, vpon the verie siege of Iustice,<br>

Lord Angelo hath to the publike eare<br>

Profest the contrarie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02989">Enter a Messenger.</p><br>

<p id="id02990"> Duke. This is his Lords man</p><br>

<p id="id02991"> Pro. And heere comes Claudio's pardon</p><br>

<p id="id02992">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. My Lord hath sent you this note,<br>

And by mee this further charge;<br>

That you swerue not from the smallest Article of it,<br>

Neither in time, matter, or other circumstance.<br>

Good morrow: for as I take it, it is almost day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02993"> Pro. I shall obey him</p><br>

<p id="id02994">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. This is his Pardon purchas'd by such sin,<br>

For which the Pardoner himselfe is in:<br>

Hence hath offence his quicke celeritie,<br>

When it is borne in high Authority.<br>

When Vice makes Mercie; Mercie's so extended,<br>

That for the faults loue, is th' offender friended.<br>

Now Sir, what newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. I told you:<br>

Lord Angelo (be-like) thinking me remisse<br>

In mine Office, awakens mee<br>

With this vnwonted putting on, methinks strangely:<br>

For he hath not vs'd it before<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02995"> Duk. Pray you let's heare.</p><br>

<p id="id02996">The Letter.</p><br>

<p id="id02997">Whatsoeuer you may heare to the contrary, let Claudio be executed<br>

by foure of the clocke, and in the afternoone Bernardine:<br>

For my better satisfaction, let mee haue Claudios<br>

head sent me by fiue. Let this be duely performed with a<br>

thought that more depends on it, then we must yet deliuer.<br>

Thus faile not to doe your Office, as you will answere it at<br>

your perill.<br>

What say you to this Sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. What is that Barnardine, who is to be executed<br>

in th' afternoone?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. A Bohemian borne: But here nurst vp &amp; bred,<br>

One that is a prisoner nine yeeres old<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id02998"> Duke. How came it, that the absent Duke had not
either deliuer'd him to his libertie, or executed him? I
haue heard it was euer his manner to do so</p><br>

<p id="id02999">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. His friends still wrought Repreeues for him:<br>

And indeed his fact till now in the gouernment of Lord<br>

Angelo, came not to an vndoubtfull proofe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. It is now apparant?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Most manifest, and not denied by himselfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03001"> Duke. Hath he borne himselfe penitently in prison?
How seemes he to be touch'd?
 Pro. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully,
but as a drunken sleepe, carelesse, wreaklesse, and
fearelesse of what's past, present, or to come: insensible
of mortality, and desperately mortall</p><br>

<p id="id03002"> Duke. He wants aduice</p><br>

<p id="id03003"> Pro. He wil heare none: he hath euermore had the liberty
of the prison: giue him leaue to escape hence, hee
would not. Drunke many times a day, if not many daies
entirely drunke. We haue verie oft awak'd him, as if to
carrie him to execution, and shew'd him a seeming warrant
for it, it hath not moued him at all</p><br>

<p id="id03004"> Duke. More of him anon: There is written in your
brow Prouost, honesty and constancie; if I reade it not
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me: but in the boldnes
of my cunning, I will lay my selfe in hazard: Claudio,
whom heere you haue warrant to execute, is no greater
forfeit to the Law, then Angelo who hath sentenc'd him.
To make you vnderstand this in a manifested effect, I
craue but foure daies respit: for the which, you are to
do me both a present, and a dangerous courtesie</p><br>

<p id="id03005">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Pray Sir, in what?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. In the delaying death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03006"> Pro. Alacke, how may I do it? Hauing the houre limited,
and an expresse command, vnder penaltie, to deliuer
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my
case as Claudio's, to crosse this in the smallest</p><br>

<p id="id03007">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. By the vow of mine Order, I warrant you,<br>

If my instructions may be your guide,<br>

Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,<br>

And his head borne to Angelo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03008">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Angelo hath seene them both,<br>

And will discouer the fauour<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03009"> Duke. Oh, death's a great disguiser, and you may
adde to it; Shaue the head, and tie the beard, and say it
was the desire of the penitent to be so bar'de before his
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you vpon this, more then thankes and good fortune,
by the Saint whom I professe, I will plead against
it with my life</p><br>

<p id="id03010"> Pro. Pardon me, good Father, it is against my oath</p><br>

<p id="id03011">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Were you sworne to the Duke, or to the Deputie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. To him, and to his Substitutes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03012"> Duke. You will thinke you haue made no offence, if
the Duke auouch the iustice of your dealing?
 Pro. But what likelihood is in that?
 Duke. Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet since
I see you fearfull, that neither my coate, integrity, nor
perswasion, can with ease attempt you, I wil go further
then I meant, to plucke all feares out of you. Looke
you Sir, heere is the hand and Seale of the Duke: you
know the Charracter I doubt not, and the Signet is not
strange to you?
 Pro. I know them both</p><br>

<p id="id03013"> Duke. The Contents of this, is the returne of the
Duke; you shall anon ouer-reade it at your pleasure:
where you shall finde within these two daies, he wil be
heere. This is a thing that Angelo knowes not, for hee
this very day receiues letters of strange tenor, perchance
of the Dukes death, perchance entering into some Monasterie,
but by chance nothing of what is writ. Looke,
th' vnfolding Starre calles vp the Shepheard; put not
your selfe into amazement, how these things should be;
all difficulties are but easie when they are knowne. Call
your executioner, and off with Barnardines head: I will
giue him a present shrift, and aduise him for a better
place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall absolutely resolue
you: Come away, it is almost cleere dawne.</p><br>

Customers. First, here's yong Mr Rash, hee's in for a
commoditie of browne paper, and olde Ginger, nine
score and seuenteene pounds, of which hee made fiue
Markes readie money: marrie then, Ginger was not
much in request, for the olde Women were all dead.
Then is there heere one Mr Caper, at the suite of Master
Three-Pile the Mercer, for some foure suites of Peachcolour'd
Satten, which now peaches him a beggar.
Then haue we heere, yong Dizie, and yong Mr Deepevow,

and dagger man, and yong Drop-heire that kild lustie
Pudding, and Mr Forthlight the Tilter, and braue Mr

And to transport him in the minde he is,<br>

Were damnable<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03044">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Heere in the prison, Father,<br>

There died this morning of a cruell Feauor,<br>

One Ragozine, a most notorious Pirate,<br>

A man of Claudio's yeares: his beard, and head<br>

Iust of his colour. What if we do omit<br>

This Reprobate, til he were wel enclin'd,<br>

And satisfie the Deputie with the visage<br>

Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Oh, 'tis an accident that heauen prouides:<br>

Dispatch it presently, the houre drawes on<br>

And sent according to command, whiles I<br>

Perswade this rude wretch willingly to die<br>

But Barnardine must die this afternoone,<br>

And how shall we continue Claudio,<br>

To saue me from the danger that might come,<br>

If he were knowne aliue?<br>

Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio,<br>

Ere twice the Sun hath made his iournall greeting<br>

To yond generation, you shal finde<br>

Your safetie manifested<br>

<p id="id03060">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. The better giuen me by so holy a man,<br>

Hath yet the Deputie sent my brothers pardon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. He hath releasd him, Isabell, from the world,<br>

His head is off, and sent to Angelo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03061"> Isa. Nay, but it is not so</p><br>

<p id="id03062">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. It is no other,<br>

Forbeare it therefore, giue your cause to heauen.<br>

By euery sillable a faithful veritie.<br>

The Duke comes home to morrow: nay drie your eyes,<br>

One of our Couent, and his Confessor<br>

Giues me this instance: Already he hath carried<br>

Notice to Escalus and Angelo,<br>

Who do prepare to meete him at the gates,<br>

There to giue vp their powre: If you can pace your wisdome,<br>

In that good path that I would wish it go,<br>

Frier, where's the Prouost?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Not within Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03071"> Luc. Oh prettie Isabella, I am pale at mine heart, to
see thine eyes so red: thou must be patient; I am faine
to dine and sup with water and bran: I dare not for my
head fill my belly. One fruitful Meale would set mee
too't: but they say the Duke will be heere to Morrow.
By my troth Isabell I lou'd thy brother, if the olde fantastical
Duke of darke corners had bene at home, he had
liued</p><br>

<p id="id03072">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Sir, the Duke is marueilous little beholding<br>

to your reports, but the best is, he liues not in them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03073">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so wel as I<br>

do: he's a better woodman then thou tak'st him for<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03074"> Duke. Well: you'l answer this one day. Fare ye well</p><br>

<p id="id03075">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Nay tarrie, Ile go along with thee,<br>

I can tel thee pretty tales of the Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03076">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. You haue told me too many of him already sir<br>

if they be true: if not true, none were enough<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03077">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucio. I was once before him for getting a Wench<br>

with childe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03078">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Did you such a thing?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Yes marrie did I; but I was faine to forswear it,<br>

They would else haue married me to the rotten Medler<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03079">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Sir your company is fairer then honest, rest you<br>

well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03080"> Lucio. By my troth Ile go with thee to the lanes end:

Will not proclaime against her maiden losse,<br>

How might she tongue me? yet reason dares her no,<br>

For my Authority beares of a credent bulke,<br>

That no particular scandall once can touch<br>

But it confounds the breather. He should haue liu'd,<br>

Here is Lord Angelo shall giue you Iustice,<br>

Reueale your selfe to him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03119">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Oh worthy Duke,<br>

You bid me seeke redemption of the diuell,<br>

Heare me your selfe: for that which I must speake<br>

Must either punish me, not being beleeu'd,<br>

Or wring redresse from you:<br>

Heare me: oh heare me, heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03120">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. My Lord, her wits I feare me are not firme:<br>

She hath bin a suitor to me, for her Brother<br>

Cut off by course of Iustice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03121"> Isab. By course of Iustice</p><br>

<p id="id03122"> Ang. And she will speake most bitterly, and strange</p><br>

<p id="id03123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Most strange: but yet most truely wil I speake,<br>

That Angelo's forsworne, is it not strange?<br>

That Angelo's a murtherer, is't not strange?<br>

That Angelo is an adulterous thiefe,<br>

An hypocrite, a virgin violator,<br>

Is it not strange? and strange?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Nay it is ten times strange?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. It is not truer he is Angelo,<br>

Then this is all as true, as it is strange;<br>

Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth<br>

To th' end of reckning<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03124">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Away with her: poore soule<br>

She speakes this, in th' infirmity of sence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03125">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. Oh Prince, I coniure thee, as thou beleeu'st<br>

There is another comfort, then this world,<br>

That thou neglect me not, with that opinion<br>

That I am touch'd with madnesse: make not impossible<br>

That which but seemes vnlike, 'tis not impossible<br>

But one, the wickedst caitiffe on the ground<br>

May seeme as shie, as graue, as iust, as absolute:<br>

As Angelo, euen so may Angelo<br>

In all his dressings, caracts, titles, formes,<br>

Be an arch-villaine: Beleeue it, royall Prince<br>

If he be lesse, he's nothing, but he's more,<br>

Had I more name for badnesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03126">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. By mine honesty<br>

If she be mad, as I beleeue no other,<br>

Her madnesse hath the oddest frame of sense,<br>

Such a dependancy of thing, on thing,<br>

As ere I heard in madnesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03127">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Oh gracious Duke<br>

Harpe not on that; nor do not banish reason<br>

For inequality, but let your reason serue<br>

To make the truth appeare, where it seemes hid,<br>

And hide the false seemes true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Many that are not mad<br>

Haue sure more lacke of reason:<br>

What would you say?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. I am the Sister of one Claudio,<br>

Condemnd vpon the Act of Fornication<br>

To loose his head, condemn'd by Angelo,<br>

I, (in probation of a Sisterhood)<br>

Was sent to by my Brother; one Lucio<br>

As then the Messenger<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03129">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. That's I, and't like your Grace:<br>

I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her,<br>

To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo,<br>

For her poore Brothers pardon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03130"> Isab. That's he indeede</p><br>

<p id="id03131"> Duk. You were not bid to speake</p><br>

<p id="id03132">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. No, my good Lord,<br>

Nor wish'd to hold my peace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03133">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I wish you now then,<br>

Pray you take note of it: and when you haue<br>

A businesse for your selfe: pray heauen you then<br>

Be perfect<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03134"> Luc. I warrant your honor</p><br>

<p id="id03135"> Duk. The warrant's for your selfe: take heede to't</p><br>

<p id="id03136"> Isab. This Gentleman told somewhat of my Tale</p><br>

<p id="id03137"> Luc. Right</p><br>

<p id="id03138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. It may be right, but you are i'the wrong<br>

To speake before your time: proceed,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. I went<br>

To this pernicious Caitiffe Deputie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03139"> Duk. That's somewhat madly spoken</p><br>

<p id="id03140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Pardon it,<br>

The phrase is to the matter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03141"> Duke. Mended againe: the matter: proceed</p><br>

<p id="id03142">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. In briefe, to set the needlesse processe by:<br>

How I perswaded, how I praid, and kneel'd,<br>

How he refeld me, and how I replide<br>

(For this was of much length) the vild conclusion<br>

I now begin with griefe, and shame to vtter.<br>

He would not, but by gift of my chaste body<br>

To his concupiscible intemperate lust<br>

Release my brother; and after much debatement,<br>

My sisterly remorse, confutes mine honour,<br>

And I did yeeld to him: But the next morne betimes,<br>

His purpose surfetting, he sends a warrant<br>

For my poore brothers head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03143"> Duke. This is most likely</p><br>

<p id="id03144"> Isab. Oh that it were as like as it is true</p><br>

<p id="id03145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. By heauen (fond wretch) y knowst not what thou speak'st,<br>

Or else thou art suborn'd against his honor<br>

In hatefull practise: first his Integritie<br>

Stands without blemish: next it imports no reason,<br>

That with such vehemency he should pursue<br>

Faults proper to himselfe: if he had so offended<br>

He would haue waigh'd thy brother by himselfe,<br>

And not haue cut him off: some one hath set you on:<br>

Confesse the truth, and say by whose aduice<br>

Thou cam'st heere to complaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03146">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. And is this all?<br>

Then oh you blessed Ministers aboue<br>

Keepe me in patience, and with ripened time<br>

Vnfold the euill, which is heere wrapt vp<br>

In countenance: heauen shield your Grace from woe,<br>

As I thus wrong'd, hence vnbeleeued goe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03147">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I know you'ld faine be gone: An Officer:<br>

To prison with her: Shall we thus permit<br>

A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall,<br>

On him so neere vs? This needs must be a practise:<br>

Who knew of your intent and comming hither?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. One that I would were heere, Frier Lodowick<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03148">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. A ghostly Father, belike:<br>

Who knowes that Lodowicke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. My Lord, I know him, 'tis a medling Fryer,<br>

I doe not like the man: had he been Lay my Lord,<br>

For certaine words he spake against your Grace<br>

In your retirment, I had swing'd him soundly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03149">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Words against mee? this' a good Fryer belike<br>

And to set on this wretched woman here<br>

Against our Substitute: Let this Fryer be found<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. But yesternight my Lord, she and that Fryer<br>

I saw them at the prison: a sawcy Fryar,<br>

A very scuruy fellow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03151">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter. Blessed be your Royall Grace:<br>

I haue stood by my Lord, and I haue heard<br>

Your royall eare abus'd: first hath this woman<br>

Most wrongfully accus'd your Substitute,<br>

Who is as free from touch, or soyle with her<br>

As she from one vngot<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03152">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. We did beleeue no lesse.<br>

Know you that Frier Lodowick that she speakes of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter. I know him for a man diuine and holy,<br>

Not scuruy, nor a temporary medler<br>

As he's reported by this Gentleman:<br>

And on my trust, a man that neuer yet<br>

Did (as he vouches) mis-report your Grace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03153"> Luc. My Lord, most villanously, beleeue it</p><br>

<p id="id03154">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter. Well: he in time may come to cleere himselfe;<br>

But at this instant he is sicke, my Lord:<br>

Of a strange Feauor: vpon his meere request<br>

Being come to knowledge, that there was complaint<br>

Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hether<br>

To speake as from his mouth, what he doth know<br>

Is true, and false: And what he with his oath<br>

And all probation will make vp full cleare<br>

Whensoeuer he's conuented: First for this woman,<br>

To iustifie this worthy Noble man<br>

So vulgarly and personally accus'd,<br>

Her shall you heare disproued to her eyes,<br>

Till she her selfe confesse it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Good Frier, let's heare it:<br>

Doe you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?<br>

Oh heauen, the vanity of wretched fooles.<br>

Giue vs some seates, Come cosen Angelo,<br>

In this I'll be impartiall: be you Iudge<br>

Of your owne Cause: Is this the Witnes Frier?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03156">Enter Mariana.</p><br>

<p id="id03157">First, let her shew your face, and after, speake</p><br>

<p id="id03158">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Pardon my Lord, I will not shew my face<br>

Vntill my husband bid me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03159">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. What, are you married?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. No my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Are you a Maid?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. No my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03161">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. A Widow then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Neither, my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03162">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Why you are nothing then: neither Maid, Widow,<br>

nor Wife?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. My Lord, she may be a Puncke: for many of<br>

them, are neither Maid, Widow, nor Wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03163">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause<br>

to prattle for himselfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03164"> Luc. Well my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03165">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. My Lord, I doe confesse I nere was married,<br>

And I confesse besides, I am no Maid,<br>

I haue known my husband, yet my husband<br>

Knowes not, that euer he knew me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03166"> Luc. He was drunk then, my Lord, it can be no better</p><br>

<p id="id03167"> Duk. For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so to</p><br>

<p id="id03168"> Luc. Well, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03169"> Duk. This is no witnesse for Lord Angelo</p><br>

<p id="id03170">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Now I come to't, my Lord.<br>

Shee that accuses him of Fornication,<br>

In selfe-same manner, doth accuse my husband,<br>

And charges him, my Lord, with such a time,<br>

When I'le depose I had him in mine Armes<br>

With all th' effect of Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Charges she moe then me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Not that I know<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03172"> Duk. No? you say your husband</p><br>

<p id="id03173">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Why iust, my Lord, and that is Angelo,<br>

Who thinkes he knowes, that he nere knew my body,<br>

But knows, he thinkes, that he knowes Isabels<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03174"> Ang. This is a strange abuse: Let's see thy face</p><br>

<p id="id03175">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. My husband bids me, now I will vnmaske.<br>

This is that face, thou cruell Angelo<br>

Which once thou sworst, was worth the looking on:<br>

This is the hand, which with a vowd contract<br>

Was fast belockt in thine: This is the body<br>

That tooke away the match from Isabell,<br>

And did supply thee at thy garden-house<br>

In her Imagin'd person<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03176">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Know you this woman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Carnallie she saies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03177"> Duk. Sirha, no more</p><br>

<p id="id03178"> Luc. Enough my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03179">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. My Lord, I must confesse, I know this woman,<br>

And fiue yeres since there was some speech of marriage<br>

Betwixt my selfe, and her: which was broke off,<br>

Partly for that her promis'd proportions<br>

Came short of Composition: But in chiefe<br>

For that her reputation was dis-valued<br>

In leuitie: Since which time of fiue yeres<br>

I neuer spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her<br>

Vpon my faith, and honor<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03180">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Noble Prince,<br>

As there comes light from heauen, and words fro[m] breath,<br>

As there is sence in truth, and truth in vertue,<br>

I am affianced this mans wife, as strongly<br>

As words could make vp vowes: And my good Lord,<br>

But Tuesday night last gon, in's garden house,<br>

He knew me as a wife. As this is true,<br>

Let me in safety raise me from my knees,<br>

Or else for euer be confixed here<br>

A Marble Monument<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03181">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. I did but smile till now,<br>

Now, good my Lord, giue me the scope of Iustice,<br>

My patience here is touch'd: I doe perceiue<br>

These poore informall women, are no more<br>

But instruments of some more mightier member<br>

That sets them on. Let me haue way, my Lord<br>

To finde this practise out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03182">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I, with my heart,<br>

And punish them to your height of pleasure.<br>

Thou foolish Frier, and thou pernicious woman<br>

Compact with her that's gone: thinkst thou, thy oathes,<br>

Though they would swear downe each particular Saint,<br>

Were testimonies against his worth, and credit<br>

That's seald in approbation? you, Lord Escalus<br>

Sit with my Cozen, lend him your kinde paines<br>

To finde out this abuse, whence 'tis deriu'd.<br>

There is another Frier that set them on,<br>

Let him be sent for<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03183">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter. Would he were here, my Lord, for he indeed<br>

Hath set the women on to this Complaint;<br>

Your Prouost knowes the place where he abides,<br>

And he may fetch him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03184">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Goe, doe it instantly:<br>

And you, my noble and well-warranted Cosen<br>

Whom it concernes to heare this matter forth,<br>

Doe with your iniuries as seemes you best<br>

In any chastisement; I for a while<br>

Will leaue you; but stir not you till you haue<br>

Well determin'd vpon these Slanderers.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03185">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id03186"> Esc. My Lord, wee'll doe it throughly: Signior Lucio,
did not you say you knew that Frier Lodowick to be a
dishonest person?
 Luc. Cucullus non facit Monachum, honest in nothing
but in his Clothes, and one that hath spoke most villanous
speeches of the Duke</p><br>

<p id="id03187"> Esc. We shall intreat you to abide heere till he come,
and inforce them against him: we shall finde this Frier a
notable fellow</p><br>

<p id="id03188"> Luc. As any in Vienna, on my word</p><br>

<p id="id03189"> Esc. Call that same Isabell here once againe, I would
speake with her: pray you, my Lord, giue mee leaue to
question, you shall see how Ile handle her</p><br>

<p id="id03190"> Luc. Not better then he, by her owne report</p><br>

<p id="id03191">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. Say you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Marry sir, I thinke, if you handled her priuately<br>

She would sooner confesse, perchance publikely she'll be<br>

asham'd.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03192">Enter Duke, Prouost, Isabella</p><br>

<p id="id03193"> Esc. I will goe darkely to worke with her</p><br>

<p id="id03194"> Luc. That's the way: for women are light at midnight</p><br>

<p id="id03195">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. Come on Mistris, here's a Gentlewoman,<br>

Denies all that you haue said<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03196">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. My Lord, here comes the rascall I spoke of,<br>

Here, with the Prouost<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03197">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. In very good time: speake not you to him, till<br>

we call vpon you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03198"> Luc. Mum</p><br>

<p id="id03199">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. Come Sir, did you set these women on to slander<br>

Lord Angelo? they haue confes'd you did<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03200"> Duk. 'Tis false</p><br>

<p id="id03201">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. How? Know you where you are?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Respect to your great place; and let the diuell<br>

Be sometime honour'd, for his burning throne.<br>

Where is the Duke? 'tis he should heare me speake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03202">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. The Duke's in vs: and we will heare you speake,<br>

Looke you speake iustly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03203">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Boldly, at least. But oh poore soules,<br>

Come you to seeke the Lamb here of the Fox;<br>

Good night to your redresse: Is the Duke gone?<br>

Then is your cause gone too: The Duke's vniust,<br>

Thus to retort your manifest Appeale,<br>

And put your triall in the villaines mouth,<br>

Which here you come to accuse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03204"> Luc. This is the rascall: this is he I spoke of</p><br>

<p id="id03205">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. Why thou vnreuerend, and vnhallowed Fryer:<br>

Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women,<br>

To accuse this worthy man? but in foule mouth,<br>

And in the witnesse of his proper eare,<br>

To call him villaine; and then to glance from him,<br>

To th'Duke himselfe, to taxe him with Iniustice?<br>

Take him hence; to th' racke with him: we'll towze you<br>

Ioynt by ioynt, but we will know his purpose:<br>

What? vniust?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Be not so hot: the Duke dare<br>

No more stretch this finger of mine, then he<br>

Dare racke his owne: his Subiect am I not,<br>

Nor here Prouinciall: My businesse in this State<br>

Made me a looker on here in Vienna,<br>

Where I haue seene corruption boyle and bubble,<br>

Till it ore-run the Stew: Lawes, for all faults,<br>

But faults so countenanc'd, that the strong Statutes<br>

Stand like the forfeites in a Barbers shop,<br>

As much in mocke, as marke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03206">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. Slander to th' State:<br>

Away with him to prison<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03207">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio?<br>

Is this the man you did tell vs of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. 'Tis he, my Lord: come hither goodman bald-pate,<br>

doe you know me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I remember you Sir, by the sound of your voice,<br>

I met you at the Prison, in the absence of the Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03208">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Oh, did you so? and do you remember what you<br>

said of the Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03209"> Duk. Most notedly Sir</p><br>

<p id="id03210"> Luc. Do you so Sir: And was the Duke a flesh-monger,
a foole, and a coward, as you then reported him
to be?
 Duk. You must (Sir) change persons with me, ere you
make that my report: you indeede spoke so of him, and
much more, much worse</p><br>

<p id="id03211">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Oh thou damnable fellow: did I not plucke thee<br>

by the nose, for thy speeches?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I protest, I loue the Duke, as I loue my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03212">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Harke how the villaine would close now, after<br>

his treasonable abuses<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03213"> Esc. Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withall: Away
with him to prison: Where is the Prouost? away with
him to prison: lay bolts enough vpon him: let him speak
no more: away with those Giglets too, and with the other
confederate companion</p><br>

<p id="id03214"> Duk. Stay Sir, stay a while</p><br>

<p id="id03215"> Ang. What, resists he? helpe him Lucio</p><br>

<p id="id03216"> Luc. Come sir, come sir, come sir: foh sir, why you
bald-pated lying rascall: you must be hooded must you?
show your knaues visage with a poxe to you: show your
sheepe-biting face, and be hang'd an houre: Will't
not off?
 Duk. Thou art the first knaue, that ere mad'st a Duke.
First Prouost, let me bayle these gentle three:
Sneake not away Sir, for the Fryer, and you,
Must haue a word anon: lay hold on him</p><br>

<p id="id03217"> Luc. This may proue worse then hanging</p><br>

<p id="id03218">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. What you haue spoke, I pardon: sit you downe,<br>

We'll borrow place of him; Sir, by your leaue:<br>

Ha'st thou or word, or wit, or impudence,<br>

That yet can doe thee office? If thou ha'st<br>

Rely vpon it, till my tale be heard,<br>

And hold no longer out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03219">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Oh, my dread Lord,<br>

I should be guiltier then my guiltinesse,<br>

To thinke I can be vndiscerneable,<br>

When I perceiue your grace, like powre diuine,<br>

Hath look'd vpon my passes. Then good Prince,<br>

No longer Session hold vpon my shame,<br>

But let my Triall, be mine owne Confession:<br>

Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,<br>

Is all the grace I beg<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03220">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Come hither Mariana,<br>

Say: was't thou ere contracted to this woman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. I was my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03221">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Goe take her hence, and marry her instantly.<br>

Doe you the office (Fryer) which consummate,<br>

Returne him here againe: goe with him Prouost.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03222">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id03223">&nbsp;&nbsp;Esc. My Lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonor,<br>

Then at the strangenesse of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03224">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Come hither Isabell,<br>

Your Frier is now your Prince: As I was then<br>

Aduertysing, and holy to your businesse,<br>

(Not changing heart with habit) I am still,<br>

Atturnied at your seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Oh giue me pardon<br>

That I, your vassaile, haue imploid, and pain'd<br>

Your vnknowne Soueraigntie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03226">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. You are pardon'd Isabell:<br>

And now, deere Maide, be you as free to vs.<br>

Your Brothers death I know sits at your heart:<br>

And you may maruaile, why I obscur'd my selfe,<br>

Labouring to saue his life: and would not rather<br>

Make rash remonstrance of my hidden powre,<br>

Then let him so be lost: oh most kinde Maid,<br>

It was the swift celeritie of his death,<br>

Which I did thinke, with slower foot came on,<br>

That brain'd my purpose: but peace be with him,<br>

That life is better life past fearing death,<br>

Then that which liues to feare: make it your comfort,<br>

So happy is your Brother.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03227">Enter Angelo, Maria, Peter, Prouost.</p><br>

<p id="id03228"> Isab. I doe my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. For this new-maried man, approaching here,<br>

Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd<br>

Your well defended honor: you must pardon<br>

For Mariana's sake: But as he adiudg'd your Brother,<br>

Being criminall, in double violation<br>

Of sacred Chastitie, and of promise-breach,<br>

Thereon dependant for your Brothers life,<br>

The very mercy of the Law cries out<br>

Most audible, euen from his proper tongue.<br>

An Angelo for Claudio, death for death:<br>

Haste still paies haste, and leasure, answers leasure;<br>

Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure:<br>

Then Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;<br>

Which though thou would'st deny, denies thee vantage.<br>

We doe condemne thee to the very Blocke<br>

Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.<br>

Away with him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03230">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Oh my most gracious Lord,<br>

I hope you will not mocke me with a husband?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. It is your husband mock't you with a husband,<br>

Consenting to the safe-guard of your honor,<br>

I thought your marriage fit: else Imputation,<br>

For that he knew you, might reproach your life,<br>

And choake your good to come: For his Possessions,<br>

Although by confutation they are ours;<br>

We doe en-state, and widow you with all,<br>

To buy you a better husband<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03231">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Oh my deere Lord,<br>

I craue no other, nor no better man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03232"> Duke. Neuer craue him, we are definitiue</p><br>

<p id="id03233"> Mar. Gentle my Liege</p><br>

<p id="id03234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. You doe but loose your labour.<br>

Away with him to death: Now Sir, to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Oh my good Lord, sweet Isabell, take my part,<br>

Lend me your knees, and all my life to come,<br>

I'll lend you all my life to doe you seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03236">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Against all sence you doe importune her,<br>

Should she kneele downe, in mercie of this fact,<br>

Her Brothers ghost, his paued bed would breake,<br>

And take her hence in horror<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03237">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Isabell:<br>

Sweet Isabel, doe yet but kneele by me,<br>

Hold vp your hands, say nothing: I'll speake all.<br>

They say best men are moulded out of faults,<br>

And for the most, become much more the better<br>

For being a little bad: So may my husband.<br>

Oh Isabel: will you not lend a knee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. He dies for Claudio's death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03238">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isab. Most bounteous Sir.<br>

Looke if it please you, on this man condemn'd,<br>

As if my Brother liu'd: I partly thinke,<br>

A due sinceritie gouerned his deedes,<br>

Till he did looke on me: Since it is so,<br>

Let him not die: my Brother had but Iustice,<br>

In that he did the thing for which he dide.<br>

For Angelo, his Act did not ore-take his bad intent,<br>

And must be buried but as an intent<br>

That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subiects<br>

Intents, but meerely thoughts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03239"> Mar. Meerely my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03240">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Your suite's vnprofitable: stand vp I say:<br>

I haue bethought me of another fault.<br>

Prouost, how came it Claudio was beheaded<br>

At an vnusuall howre?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. It was commanded so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Had you a speciall warrant for the deed?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. No my good Lord: it was by priuate message<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03242">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. For which I doe discharge you of your office,<br>

Giue vp your keyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. Pardon me, noble Lord,<br>

I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,<br>

Yet did repent me after more aduice,<br>

For testimony whereof, one in the prison<br>

That should by priuate order else haue dide,<br>

I haue reseru'd aliue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03244">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. What's he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. His name is Barnardine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I would thou hadst done so by Claudio:<br>

Goe fetch him hither, let me looke vpon him<br>
</p><br>

For better times to come: Frier aduise him,<br>

I leaue him to your hand. What muffeld fellow's that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. This is another prisoner that I sau'd,<br>

Who should haue di'd when Claudio lost his head,<br>

As like almost to Claudio, as himselfe<br>

Is he pardon'd, and for your louelie sake<br>

Giue me your hand, and say you will be mine,<br>

He is my brother too: But fitter time for that:<br>

By this Lord Angelo perceiues he's safe,<br>

Methinkes I see a quickning in his eye:<br>

Well Angelo, your euill quits you well.<br>

Looke that you loue your wife: her worth, worth yours<br>

I finde an apt remission in my selfe:<br>

And yet heere's one in place I cannot pardon,<br>

You sirha, that knew me for a foole, a Coward,<br>

One all of Luxurie, an asse, a mad man:<br>

Wherein haue I so deseru'd of you<br>

That you extoll me thus?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. 'Faith my Lord, I spoke it but according to the<br>

trick: if you will hang me for it you may: but I had rather<br>

it would please you, I might be whipt<br>

whom he begot with childe) let her appeare,<br>

And he shall marry her: the nuptiall finish'd,<br>

Let him be whipt and hang'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03253"> Luc. I beseech your Highnesse doe not marry me to
a Whore: your Highnesse said euen now I made you a

Remit thy other forfeits: take him to prison,<br>

And see our pleasure herein executed<br>

Thanks good friend, Escalus, for thy much goodnesse,<br>

Why thou departedst from thy natiue home?<br>

Then I to speake my griefes vnspeakeable:<br>

Yet that the world may witnesse that my end<br>

Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,<br>

Ile vtter what my sorrow giues me leaue.<br>

In Syracusa was I borne, and wedde<br>

Vnto a woman, happy but for me,<br>

And by me; had not our hap beene bad:<br>

With her I liu'd in ioy, our wealth increast<br>

By prosperous voyages I often made<br>

To Epidamium, till my factors death,<br>

And he great care of goods at randone left,<br>

Drew me from kinde embracements of my spouse;<br>

From whom my absence was not sixe moneths olde,<br>

Before her selfe (almost at fainting vnder<br>

The pleasing punishment that women beare)<br>

Had made prouision for her following me,<br>

And soone, and safe, arriued where I was:<br>

There had she not beene long, but she became<br>

A ioyfull mother of two goodly sonnes:<br>

And, which was strange, the one so like the other,<br>

As could not be distinguish'd but by names.<br>

That very howre, and in the selfe-same Inne,<br>

A meane woman was deliuered<br>

Of such a burthen Male, twins both alike:<br>

Those, for their parents were exceeding poore,<br>

I bought, and brought vp to attend my sonnes.<br>

My wife, not meanely prowd of two such boyes,<br>

Made daily motions for our home returne:<br>

Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too soone wee came aboord.<br>

A league from Epidamium had we saild<br>

Before the alwaies winde-obeying deepe<br>

Gaue any Tragicke Instance of our harme:<br>

But longer did we not retaine much hope;<br>

For what obscured light the heauens did grant,<br>

Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes<br>

A doubtfull warrant of immediate death,<br>

Which though my selfe would gladly haue imbrac'd,<br>

Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br>

Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br>

And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes<br>

That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to feare,<br>

Forst me to seeke delayes for them and me,<br>

And this it was: (for other meanes was none)<br>

The Sailors sought for safety by our boate,<br>

And left the ship then sinking ripe to vs.<br>

My wife, more carefull for the latter borne,<br>

Had fastned him vnto a small spare Mast,<br>

Such as sea-faring men prouide for stormes:<br>

To him one of the other twins was bound,<br>

Whil'st I had beene like heedfull of the other.<br>

The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,<br>

Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt,<br>

Fastned our selues at eyther end the mast,<br>

And floating straight, obedient to the streame,<br>

Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br>

At length the sonne gazing vpon the earth,<br>

Disperst those vapours that offended vs,<br>

And by the benefit of his wished light<br>

The seas waxt calme, and we discouered<br>

Two shippes from farre, making amaine to vs:<br>

Of Corinth that, of Epidarus this,<br>

But ere they came, oh let me say no more,<br>

Gather the sequell by that went before<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03269">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Nay forward old man, doe not breake off so,<br>

For we may pitty, though not pardon thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03270">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merch. Oh had the gods done so, I had not now<br>

Worthily tearm'd them mercilesse to vs:<br>

For ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues,<br>

We were encountred by a mighty rocke,<br>

Which being violently borne vp,<br>

Our helpefull ship was splitted in the midst;<br>

So that in this vniust diuorce of vs,<br>

Fortune had left to both of vs alike,<br>

What to delight in, what to sorrow for,<br>

Her part, poore soule, seeming as burdened<br>

With lesser waight, but not with lesser woe,<br>

Was carried with more speed before the winde,<br>

And in our sight they three were taken vp<br>

By Fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br>

At length another ship had seiz'd on vs,<br>

And knowing whom it was their hap to saue,<br>

Gaue healthfull welcome to their ship-wrackt guests,<br>

And would haue reft the Fishers of their prey,<br>

Had not their backe beene very slow of saile;<br>

And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br>

Thus haue you heard me seuer'd from my blisse,<br>

That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,<br>

To tell sad stories of my owne mishaps<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03272">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merch. My yongest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br>

At eighteene yeeres became inquisitiue<br>

After his brother; and importun'd me<br>

That his attendant, so his case was like,<br>

Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name,<br>

Might beare him company in the quest of him:<br>

Whom whil'st I laboured of a loue to see,<br>

I hazarded the losse of whom I lou'd.<br>

Fiue Sommers haue I spent in farthest Greece,<br>

Roming cleane through the bounds of Asia,<br>

And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus:<br>

Hopelesse to finde, yet loth to leaue vnsought<br>

Or that, or any place that harbours men:<br>

But heere must end the story of my life,<br>

And happy were I in my timelie death,<br>

Could all my trauells warrant me they liue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03273">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Haplesse Egeon whom the fates haue markt<br>

To beare the extremitie of dire mishap:<br>

Now trust me, were it not against our Lawes,<br>

Against my Crowne, my oath, my dignity,<br>

But though thou art adiudged to the death,<br>

Yet will I fauour thee in what I can;<br>

Therefore Marchant, Ile limit thee this day<br>

feele his blowes; and withall so doubtfully, that I could
scarce vnderstand them</p><br>

<p id="id03323">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. But say, I prethee, is he comming home?<br>

It seemes he hath great care to please his wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03324"> E.Dro. Why Mistresse, sure my Master is horne mad</p><br>

<p id="id03325">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. Horne mad, thou villaine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. I meane not Cuckold mad,<br>

But sure he is starke mad:<br>

When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,<br>

He ask'd me for a hundred markes in gold:<br>

'Tis dinner time, quoth I: my gold, quoth he:<br>

Your meat doth burne, quoth I: my gold quoth he:<br>

Will you come, quoth I: my gold, quoth he;<br>

Where is the thousand markes I gaue thee villaine?<br>

The Pigge quoth I, is burn'd: my gold, quoth he:<br>

My mistresse, sir, quoth I: hang vp thy Mistresse:<br>

I know not thy mistresse, out on thy mistresse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03326"> Luci. Quoth who?
 E.Dr. Quoth my Master, I know quoth he, no house,
no wife, no mistresse: so that my arrant due vnto my
tongue, I thanke him, I bare home vpon my shoulders:
for in conclusion, he did beat me there</p><br>

<p id="id03327"> Adri. Go back againe, thou slaue, &amp; fetch him home</p><br>

<p id="id03328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Goe backe againe, and be new beaten home?<br>

For Gods sake send some other messenger<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03329"> Adri. Backe slaue, or I will breake thy pate a-crosse</p><br>

<p id="id03330">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. And he will blesse y crosse with other beating:<br>

Betweene you, I shall haue a holy head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03331"> Adri. Hence prating pesant, fetch thy Master home</p><br>

<p id="id03332">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Am I so round with you, as you with me,<br>

That like a foot-ball you doe spurne me thus:<br>

You spurne me hence, and he will spurne me hither,<br>

If I last in this seruice, you must case me in leather<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03333"> Luci. Fie how impatience lowreth in your face</p><br>

<p id="id03334">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. His company must do his minions grace,<br>

Whil'st I at home starue for a merrie looke:<br>

Hath homelie age th' alluring beauty tooke<br>

From my poore cheeke? then he hath wasted it.<br>

Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit,<br>

If voluble and sharpe discourse be mar'd,<br>

Vnkindnesse blunts it more then marble hard.<br>

Doe their gay vestments his affections baite?<br>

That's not my fault, hee's master of my state.<br>

What ruines are in me that can be found,<br>

By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground<br>

Of my defeatures. My decayed faire,<br>

A sunnie looke of his, would soone repaire.<br>

But, too vnruly Deere, he breakes the pale,<br>

And feedes from home; poore I am but his stale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03335"> Luci. Selfe-harming Iealousie; fie beat it hence</p><br>

<p id="id03336">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad. Vnfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispence:<br>

I know his eye doth homage other-where,<br>

Or else, what lets it but he would be here?<br>

Sister, you know he promis'd me a chaine,<br>

Would that alone, a loue he would detaine,<br>

So he would keepe faire quarter with his bed:<br>

I see the Iewell best enamaled<br>

Will loose his beautie: yet the gold bides still<br>

That others touch, and often touching will,<br>

Where gold and no man that hath a name,<br>

By falshood and corruption doth it shame:<br>

Since that my beautie cannot please his eie,<br>

Ile weepe (what's left away) and weeping die<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03337"> Luci. How manie fond fooles serue mad Ielousie?</p><br>

<p id="id03338">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id03339">Enter Antipholis Errotis.</p><br>

<p id="id03340">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. The gold I gaue to Dromio is laid vp<br>

Safe at the Centaur, and the heedfull slaue<br>

Is wandred forth in care to seeke me out<br>

By computation and mine hosts report.<br>

I could not speake with Dromio, since at first<br>

I sent him from the Mart? see here he comes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03341">Enter Dromio Siracusia.</p><br>

<p id="id03342">How now sir, is your merrie humor alter'd?<br>

As you loue stroakes, so iest with me againe:<br>

You know no Centaur? you receiu'd no gold?<br>

Your Mistresse sent to haue me home to dinner?<br>

My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,<br>

That thus so madlie thou did didst answere me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. What answer sir? when spake I such a word?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. Euen now, euen here, not halfe an howre since<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03343">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. I did not see you since you sent me hence<br>

Home to the Centaur with the gold you gaue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03344">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Villaine, thou didst denie the golds receit,<br>

And toldst me of a Mistresse, and a dinner,<br>

For which I hope thou feltst I was displeas'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03345">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. I am glad to see you in this merrie vaine,<br>

What meanes this iest, I pray you Master tell me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Yea, dost thou ieere &amp; flowt me in the teeth?<br>

Thinkst y I iest? hold, take thou that, &amp; that.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03346">Beats Dro.</p><br>

<p id="id03347">&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dr. Hold sir, for Gods sake, now your iest is earnest,<br>

Vpon what bargaine do you giue it me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Antiph. Because that I familiarlie sometimes<br>

Doe vse you for my foole, and chat with you,<br>

Your sawcinesse will iest vpon my loue,<br>

And make a Common of my serious howres,<br>

When the sunne shines, let foolish gnats make sport,<br>

But creepe in crannies, when he hides his beames:<br>

If you will iest with me, know my aspect,<br>

And fashion your demeanor to my lookes,<br>

Or I will beat this method in your sconce<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03348"> S.Dro. Sconce call you it? so you would leaue battering,
I had rather haue it a head, and you vse these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head, and Insconce it
to, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders, but I pray
sir, why am I beaten?
 Ant. Dost thou not know?
 S.Dro. Nothing sir, but that I am beaten</p><br>

<p id="id03349">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Shall I tell you why?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. I sir, and wherefore; for they say, euery why<br>

hath a wherefore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Why first for flowting me, and then wherefore,<br>

for vrging it the second time to me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03351"> S.Dro. Was there euer anie man thus beaten out of
season, when in the why and the wherefore, is neither
rime nor reason. Well sir, I thanke you</p><br>

<p id="id03352">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Thanke me sir, for what?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Marry sir, for this something that you gaue me<br>

for nothing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Ile make you amends next, to giue you nothing<br>

for something. But say sir, is it dinner time?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. No sir, I thinke the meat wants that I haue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03354">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. In good time sir: what's that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Basting<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03355"> Ant. Well sir, then 'twill be drie</p><br>

<p id="id03356"> S.Dro. If it be sir, I pray you eat none of it</p><br>

<p id="id03357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Your reason?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Lest it make you chollericke, and purchase me<br>

another drie basting<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03358">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Well sir, learne to iest in good time, there's a<br>

time for all things<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03359">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. I durst haue denied that before you were so<br>

chollericke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. By what rule sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Marry sir, by a rule as plaine as the plaine bald<br>

pate of Father time himselfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03361"> Ant. Let's heare it</p><br>

<p id="id03362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. There's no time for a man to recouer his haire<br>

that growes bald by nature<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03363">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. May he not doe it by fine and recouerie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Yes, to pay a fine for a perewig, and recouer<br>

the lost haire of another man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03364"> Ant. Why, is Time such a niggard of haire, being (as
it is) so plentifull an excrement?
 S.Dro. Because it is a blessing that hee bestowes on
beasts, and what he hath scanted them in haire, hee hath
giuen them in wit</p><br>

<p id="id03365">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Why, but theres manie a man hath more haire<br>

then wit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03366">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose<br>

his haire<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03367">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers<br>

without wit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03368">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he looseth<br>

it in a kinde of iollitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03369"> An. For what reason</p><br>

<p id="id03370"> S.Dro. For two, and sound ones to</p><br>

<p id="id03371"> An. Nay not sound I pray you</p><br>

<p id="id03372"> S.Dro. Sure ones then</p><br>

<p id="id03373"> An. Nay, not sure in a thing falsing</p><br>

<p id="id03374"> S.Dro. Certaine ones then</p><br>

<p id="id03375"> An. Name them</p><br>

<p id="id03376"> S.Dro. The one to saue the money that he spends in
trying: the other, that at dinner they should not drop in
his porrage</p><br>

<p id="id03377">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. You would all this time haue prou'd, there is no<br>

time for all things<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03378">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Marry and did sir: namely, in no time to recouer<br>

haire lost by Nature<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03379">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. But your reason was not substantiall, why there<br>

is no time to recouer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Thus I mend it: Time himselfe is bald, and<br>

therefore to the worlds end, will haue bald followers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03381">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion: but soft,<br>

who wafts vs yonder.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03382">Enter Adriana and Luciana.</p><br>

<p id="id03383">&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. I, I, Antipholus, looke strange and frowne,<br>

Some other Mistresse hath thy sweet aspects:<br>

I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.<br>

The time was once, when thou vn-vrg'd wouldst vow,<br>

That neuer words were musicke to thine eare,<br>

That neuer obiect pleasing in thine eye,<br>

That neuer touch well welcome to thy hand,<br>

That neuer meat sweet-sauour'd in thy taste,<br>

Vnlesse I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or caru'd to thee.<br>

How comes it now, my Husband, oh how comes it,<br>

That thou art then estranged from thy selfe?<br>

Thy selfe I call it, being strange to me:<br>

That vndiuidable Incorporate<br>

Am better then thy deere selfes better part.<br>

Ah doe not teare away thy selfe from me;<br>

For know my loue: as easie maist thou fall<br>

A drop of water in the breaking gulfe,<br>

And take vnmingled thence that drop againe<br>

Without addition or diminishing,<br>

As take from me thy selfe, and not me too.<br>

How deerely would it touch thee to the quicke,<br>

Shouldst thou but heare I were licencious?<br>

And that this body consecrate to thee,<br>

By Ruffian Lust should be contaminate?<br>

Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurne at me,<br>

And hurle the name of husband in my face,<br>

And teare the stain'd skin of my Harlot brow,<br>

And from my false hand cut the wedding ring,<br>

And breake it with a deepe-diuorcing vow?<br>

I know thou canst, and therefore see thou doe it.<br>

I am possest with an adulterate blot,<br>

My bloud is mingled with the crime of lust:<br>

For if we two be one, and thou play false,<br>

I doe digest the poison of thy flesh,<br>

Being strumpeted by thy contagion:<br>

Keepe then faire league and truce with thy true bed,<br>

I liue distain'd, thou vndishonoured<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03384">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antip. Plead you to me faire dame? I know you not:<br>

In Ephesus I am but two houres old,<br>

As strange vnto your towne, as to your talke,<br>

Who euery word by all my wit being scan'd,<br>

Wants wit in all, one word to vnderstand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03385">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luci. Fie brother, how the world is chang'd with you:<br>

When were you wont to vse my sister thus?<br>

She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03386">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. By Dromio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Drom. By me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03387">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. By thee, and this thou didst returne from him.<br>

That he did buffet thee, and in his blowes,<br>

Denied my house for his, me for his wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03388">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Did you conuerse sir with this gentlewoman:<br>

What is the course and drift of your compact?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. I sir? I neuer saw her till this time<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03389">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Villaine thou liest, for euen her verie words,<br>

Didst thou deliuer to me on the Mart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03390"> S.Dro. I neuer spake with her in all my life</p><br>

<p id="id03391">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. How can she thus then call vs by our names?<br>

Vnlesse it be by inspiration<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03392">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. How ill agrees it with your grauitie,<br>

To counterfeit thus grosely with your slaue,<br>

Abetting him to thwart me in my moode;<br>

Be it my wrong, you are from me exempt,<br>

But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.<br>

Come I will fasten on this sleeue of thine:<br>

Thou art an Elme my husband, I a Vine:<br>

Whose weaknesse married to thy stranger state,<br>

Makes me with thy strength to communicate:<br>

If ought possesse thee from me, it is drosse,<br>

Vsurping Iuie, Brier, or idle Mosse,<br>

Who all for want of pruning, with intrusion,<br>

Infect thy sap, and liue on thy confusion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03393">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. To mee shee speakes, shee moues mee for her<br>

theame;<br>

What, was I married to her in my dreame?<br>

Or sleepe I now, and thinke I heare all this?<br>

What error driues our eies and eares amisse?<br>

Vntill I know this sure vncertaintie,<br>

Ile entertaine the free'd fallacie<br>

We talke with Goblins, Owles and Sprights;<br>

If we obay them not, this will insue:<br>

They'll sucke our breath, or pinch vs blacke and blew<br>

Whil'st man and Master laughes my woes to scorne:<br>

Come sir to dinner, Dromio keepe the gate:<br>

Husband Ile dine aboue with you to day,<br>

And shriue you of a thousand idle prankes:<br>

Sirra, if any aske you for your Master,<br>

Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter:<br>

Come sister, Dromio play the Porter well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03404">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Am I in earth, in heauen, or in hell?<br>

Sleeping or waking, mad or well aduisde:<br>

Knowne vnto these, and to my selfe disguisde:<br>

Ile say as they say, and perseuer so:<br>

And in this mist at all aduentures go<br>

My wife is shrewish when I keepe not howres;<br>

Say that I lingerd with you at your shop<br>

To see the making of her Carkanet,<br>

And that to morrow you will bring it home.<br>

But here's a villaine that would face me downe<br>

He met me on the Mart, and that I beat him,<br>

And charg'd him with a thousand markes in gold,<br>

And that I did denie my wife and house;<br>

Thou drunkard thou, what didst thou meane by this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. Say what you wil sir, but I know what I know,<br>

That you beat me at the Mart I haue your hand to show;<br>

If y skin were parchment, &amp; y blows you gaue were ink,<br>

Your owne hand-writing would tell you what I thinke<br>

<p id="id03410"> E.Ant. I thinke thou art an asse</p><br>

By the wrongs I suffer, and the blowes I beare,<br>

I should kicke being kickt, and being at that passe,<br>

You would keepe from my heeles, and beware of an asse<br>

<p id="id03439"> Luce. Let him knocke till it ake</p><br>

<p id="id03440">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. You'll crie for this minion, if I beat the doore<br>

<p id="id03441">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luce. What needs all that, and a paire of stocks in the<br>

<p id="id03442">Enter Adriana.</p><br>

<p id="id03443">&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. Who is that at the doore y keeps all this noise?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. By my troth your towne is troubled with vnruly<br>

<p id="id03449">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. They stand at the doore, Master, bid them<br>

welcome hither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03450">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. There is something in the winde, that we cannot<br>

get in<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03451">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. You would say so Master, if your garments<br>

were thin.<br>

Your cake here is warme within: you stand here in the<br>

cold.<br>

It would make a man mad as a Bucke to be so bought<br>

and sold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03452"> Ant. Go fetch me something, Ile break ope the gate</p><br>

<p id="id03453" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> S.Dro. Breake any breaking here, and Ile breake your
knaues pate</p><br>

<p id="id03454"> E.Dro. A man may breake a word with your sir, and
words are but winde:
I and breake it in your face, so he break it not behinde</p><br>

<p id="id03455">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. It seemes thou want'st breaking, out vpon thee<br>

hinde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03456">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. Here's too much out vpon thee, I pray thee let<br>

<p id="id03457">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. I, when fowles haue no feathers, and fish haue<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id03458"> Ant. Well, Ile breake in: go borrow me a crow</p><br>

<p id="id03459">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. A crow without feather, Master meane you so;<br>

For a fish without a finne, ther's a fowle without a fether,<br>

If a crow help vs in sirra, wee'll plucke a crow together<br>

Heerein you warre against your reputation,<br>

And draw within the compasse of suspect<br>

Th' vnuiolated honor of your wife.<br>

Once this your long experience of your wisedome,<br>

Her sober vertue, yeares, and modestie,<br>

Plead on your part some cause to you vnknowne;<br>

And doubt not sir, but she will well excuse<br>

Why at this time the dores are made against you.<br>

Be rul'd by me, depart in patience,<br>

And let vs to the Tyger all to dinner,<br>

And about euening come your selfe alone,<br>

To know the reason of this strange restraint:<br>

If by strong hand you offer to breake in<br>

Now in the stirring passage of the day,<br>

A vulgar comment will be made of it;<br>

And that supposed by the common rowt<br>

Against your yet vngalled estimation,<br>

That may with foule intrusion enter in,<br>

And dwell vpon your graue when you are dead;<br>

For slander liues vpon succession:<br>

For euer hows'd, where it gets possession<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03462">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. You haue preuail'd, I will depart in quiet,<br>

And in despight of mirth meane to be merrie:<br>

I know a wench of excellent discourse,<br>

Prettie and wittie; wilde, and yet too gentle;<br>

There will we dine: this woman that I meane<br>

My wife (but I protest without desert)<br>

Hath oftentimes vpbraided me withall:<br>

To her will we to dinner, get you home<br>

And fetch the chaine, by this I know 'tis made,<br>

Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine,<br>

For there's the house: That chaine will I bestow<br>

(Be it for nothing but to spight my wife)<br>

Vpon mine hostesse there, good sir make haste:<br>

Since mine owne doores refuse to entertaine me,<br>

Ile knocke else-where, to see if they'll disdaine me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03463"> Ang. Ile meet you at that place some houre hence</p><br>

<p id="id03464"> Anti. Do so, this iest shall cost me some expence.</p><br>

<p id="id03466">Enter Iuliana, with Antipholus of Siracusia.</p><br>

<p id="id03467">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iulia. And may it be that you haue quite forgot<br>

A husbands office? shall Antipholus<br>

Euen in the spring of Loue, thy Loue-springs rot?<br>

Shall loue in buildings grow so ruinate?<br>

If you did wed my sister for her wealth,<br>

Then for her wealths-sake vse her with more kindnesse:<br>

Or if you like else-where doe it by stealth,<br>

Muffle your false loue with some shew of blindnesse:<br>

Let not my sister read it in your eye:<br>

Be not thy tongue thy owne shames Orator:<br>

Looke sweet, speake faire, become disloyaltie:<br>

Apparell vice like vertues harbenger:<br>

Beare a faire presence, though your heart be tainted,<br>

Teach sinne the carriage of a holy Saint,<br>

Be secret false: what need she be acquainted?<br>

What simple thiefe brags of his owne attaine?<br>

'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,<br>

And let her read it in thy lookes at boord:<br>

Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed,<br>

Ill deeds is doubled with an euill word:<br>

Alas poore women, make vs not beleeue<br>

(Being compact of credit) that you loue vs,<br>

Though others haue the arme, shew vs the sleeue:<br>

We in your motion turne, and you may moue vs.<br>

Then gentle brother get you in againe;<br>

Comfort my sister, cheere her, call her wise;<br>

'Tis holy sport to be a little vaine,<br>

When the sweet breath of flatterie conquers strife<br>

<p id="id03468">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Anti. Sweete Mistris, what your name is else I<br>

know not;<br>

Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine:<br>

Lesse in your knowledge, and your grace you show not,<br>

Then our earths wonder, more then earth diuine.<br>

Teach me deere creature how to thinke and speake:<br>

Lay open to my earthie grosse conceit:<br>

Smothred in errors, feeble, shallow, weake,<br>

The foulded meaning of your words deceit:<br>

Against my soules pure truth, why labour you,<br>

To make it wander in an vnknowne field?<br>

Are you a god? would you create me new?<br>

Transforme me then, and to your powre Ile yeeld.<br>

But if that I am I, then well I know,<br>

Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br>

Nor to her bed no homage doe I owe:<br>

Farre more, farre more, to you doe I decline:<br>

Oh traine me not sweet Mermaide with thy note,<br>

To drowne me in thy sister floud of teares:<br>

Sing Siren for thy selfe, and I will dote:<br>

Spread ore the siluer waues thy golden haires;<br>

And as a bud Ile take thee, and there lie:<br>

And in that glorious supposition thinke,<br>

He gaines by death, that hath such meanes to die:<br>

Let Loue, being light, be drowned if she sinke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03469">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. What are you mad, that you doe reason so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Not mad, but mated, how I doe not know<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03470"> Luc. It is a fault that springeth from your eie</p><br>

<p id="id03471"> Ant. For gazing on your beames faire sun being by</p><br>

<p id="id03472" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Luc. Gaze when you should, and that will cleere
your sight</p><br>

<p id="id03473"> Ant. As good to winke sweet loue, as looke on night</p><br>

<p id="id03474"> Luc. Why call you me loue? Call my sister so</p><br>

<p id="id03475"> Ant. Thy sisters sister</p><br>

<p id="id03476"> Luc. That's my sister</p><br>

<p id="id03477">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. No: it is thy selfe, mine owne selfes better part:<br>

Mine eies cleere eie, my deere hearts deerer heart;<br>

My foode, my fortune, and my sweet hopes aime;<br>

My sole earths heauen, and my heauens claime<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03478"> Luc. All this my sister is, or else should be</p><br>

<p id="id03479">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Call thy selfe sister sweet, for I am thee:<br>

Thee will I loue, and with thee lead my life;<br>

Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife:<br>

Giue me thy hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03480">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Oh soft sir, hold you still:<br>

Ile fetch my sister to get her good will.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03481">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id03482">Enter Dromio, Siracusia.</p><br>

<p id="id03483">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Why how now Dromio, where run'st thou so<br>

fast?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Doe you know me sir? Am I Dromio? Am I<br>

your man? Am I my selfe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art<br>

thy selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03484">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. I am an asse, I am a womans man, and besides<br>

my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03485">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. What womans man? and how besides thy<br>

selfe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Marrie sir, besides my selfe, I am due to a woman:<br>

One that claimes me, one that haunts me, one that will<br>

haue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03486"> Anti. What claime laies she to thee?
 Dro. Marry sir, such claime as you would lay to your
horse, and she would haue me as a beast, not that I beeing
a beast she would haue me, but that she being a verie
beastly creature layes claime to me</p><br>

<p id="id03487"> Anti. What is she?
 Dro. A very reuerent body: I such a one, as a man
may not speake of, without he say sir reuerence, I haue
but leane lucke in the match, and yet is she a wondrous
fat marriage</p><br>

<p id="id03488"> Anti. How dost thou meane a fat marriage?
 Dro. Marry sir, she's the Kitchin wench, &amp; al grease,
and I know not what vse to put her too, but to make a
Lampe of her, and run from her by her owne light. I
warrant, her ragges and the Tallow in them, will burne
a Poland Winter: If she liues till doomesday, she'l burne
a weeke longer then the whole World</p><br>

<p id="id03489">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. What complexion is she of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Swart like my shoo, but her face nothing like<br>

so cleane kept: for why? she sweats a man may goe ouer-shooes<br>

in the grime of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03490"> Anti. That's a fault that water will mend</p><br>

<p id="id03491">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. No sir, 'tis in graine, Noahs flood could not<br>

do it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03492">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. What's her name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Nell Sir: but her name is three quarters, that's<br>

an Ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip<br>

to hip<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03493">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. Then she beares some bredth?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. No longer from head to foot, then from hippe<br>

to hippe: she is sphericall, like a globe: I could find out<br>

Countries in her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03494">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. In what part of her body stands Ireland?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Marry sir in her buttockes, I found it out by<br>

the bogges<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03495">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Where Scotland?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. I found it by the barrennesse, hard in the palme<br>

of the hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03496">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Where France?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. In her forhead, arm'd and reuerted, making<br>

warre against her heire<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03497">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Where England?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. I look'd for the chalkle Cliffes, but I could find<br>

no whitenesse in them. But I guesse, it stood in her chin<br>

by the salt rheume that ranne betweene France, and it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03498">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Where Spaine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Faith I saw it not: but I felt it hot in her breth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03499"> Ant. Where America, the Indies?
 Dro. Oh sir, vpon her nose, all ore embellished with
Rubies, Carbuncles, Saphires, declining their rich Aspect
to the hot breath of Spaine, who sent whole Armadoes
of Carrects to be ballast at her nose</p><br>

<p id="id03500"> Anti. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
 Dro. Oh sir, I did not looke so low. To conclude,
this drudge or Diuiner layd claime to mee, call'd mee
Dromio, swore I was assur'd to her, told me what priuie
markes I had about mee, as the marke of my shoulder,
the Mole in my necke, the great Wart on my left arme,
that I amaz'd ranne from her as a witch. And I thinke, if
my brest had not beene made of faith, and my heart of
steele, she had transform'd me to a Curtull dog, &amp; made
me turne i'th wheele</p><br>

<p id="id03501">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. Go hie thee presently, post to the rode,<br>

And if the winde blow any way from shore,<br>

I will not harbour in this Towne to night.<br>

If any Barke put forth, come to the Mart,<br>

Where I will walke till thou returne to me:<br>

If euerie one knowes vs, and we know none,<br>

'Tis time I thinke to trudge, packe, and be gone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03502">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. As from a Beare a man would run for life,<br>

So flie I from her that would be my wife.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03503">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id03504">&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. There's none but Witches do inhabite heere,<br>

And therefore 'tis hie time that I were hence:<br>

She that doth call me husband, euen my soule<br>

Doth for a wife abhorre. But her faire sister<br>

Possest with such a gentle soueraigne grace,<br>

Of such inchanting presence and discourse,<br>

Hath almost made me Traitor to my selfe:<br>

But least my selfe be guilty to selfe wrong,<br>

Ile stop mine eares against the Mermaids song.<br>

I thought to haue tane you at the Porpentine,<br>

The chaine vnfinish'd made me stay thus long<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03509">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. What is your will that I shal do with this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. What please your selfe sir: I haue made it for<br>

you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03510"> Anti. Made it for me sir, I bespoke it not</p><br>

<p id="id03511">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang. Not once, nor twice, but twentie times you<br>

Go home with it, and please your Wife withall,<br>

And soone at supper time Ile visit you,<br>

And then receiue my money for the chaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03512">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti. I pray you sir receiue the money now.<br>

For feare you ne're see chaine, nor mony more<br>

<p id="id03513"> Ang. You are a merry man sir, fare you well.</p><br>

<p id="id03514">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id03515">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. What I should thinke of this, I cannot tell:<br>

But this I thinke, there's no man is so vaine,<br>

That would refuse so faire an offer'd Chaine.<br>

I see a man heere needs not liue by shifts,<br>

When in the streets he meetes such Golden gifts:<br>

Ile to the Mart, and there for Dromio stay,<br>

If any ship put out, then straight away.<br>

How much your Chaine weighs to the vtmost charect,<br>

I pray you see him presently discharg'd,<br>

For he is bound to Sea, and stayes but for it<br>

Disburse the summe, on the receit thereof,<br>

Might'st thou perceiue austeerely in his eie,<br>

Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?<br>

What obseruation mad'st thou in this case?<br>

<p id="id03571">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. With what perswasion did he tempt thy loue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. With words, that in an honest suit might moue.<br>

First, he did praise my beautie, then my speech<br>

Vicious, vngentle, foolish, blunt, vnkinde,<br>

Stigmaticall in making worse in minde<br>

And yet would herein others eies were worse:<br>

A diuell in an euerlasting garment hath him;<br>

On whose hard heart is button'd vp with steele:<br>

A Feind, a Fairie, pittilesse and ruffe:<br>

A Wolfe, nay worse, a fellow all in buffe:<br>

A back friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that counterma[n]ds<br>

The passages of allies, creekes, and narrow lands:<br>

A hound that runs Counter, and yet draws drifoot well,<br>

One that before the Iudgme[n]t carries poore soules to hel<br>

<p id="id03580">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. Why man, what is the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. No, no, the bell, 'tis time that I were gone:<br>

It was two ere I left him, and now the clocke strikes one<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03586"> Adr. The houres come backe, that did I neuer here</p><br>

backe for verie feare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03588">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. As if time were in debt: how fondly do'st thou<br>

reason?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Time is a verie bankerout, and owes more then<br>

he's worth to season.<br>

Nay, he's a theefe too: haue you not heard men say,<br>

That time comes stealing on by night and day?<br>

If I be in debt and theft, and a Serieant in the way,<br>

 S.Dro. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise: but
that Adam that keepes the prison; hee that goes in the
calues-skin, that was kil'd for the Prodigall: hee that
came behinde you sir, like an euill angel, and bid you forsake
your libertie</p><br>

<p id="id03596"> Ant. I vnderstand thee not</p><br>

gentlemen are tired giues them a sob, and rests them:
he sir, that takes pittie on decaied men, and giues them
suites of durance: he that sets vp his rest to doe more exploits
with his Mace, then a Moris Pike</p><br>

<p id="id03598"> Ant. What thou mean'st an officer?
 S.Dro. I sir, the Serieant of the Band: he that brings

<p id="id03599"> Ant. Well sir, there rest in your foolerie:
Is there any ships puts forth to night? may we be gone?

Delay: Here are the angels that you sent for to deliuer

<p id="id03608">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Auoid then fiend, what tel'st thou me of supping?<br>

Thou art, as you are all a sorceresse:<br>

I coniure thee to leaue me, and be gon<br>

Else would he neuer so demeane himselfe,<br>

A Ring he hath of mine worth fortie Duckets,<br>

And for the same he promis'd me a Chaine,<br>

Both one and other he denies me now:<br>

The reason that I gather he is mad,<br>

Besides this present instance of his rage,<br>

Is a mad tale he told to day at dinner,<br>

Of his owne doores being shut against his entrance.<br>

Belike his wife acquainted with his fits,<br>

On purpose shut the doores against his way:<br>

My way is now to hie home to his house,<br>

And tell his wife, that being Lunaticke,<br>

He rush'd into my house, and tooke perforce<br>

my long eares. I haue serued him from the houre of my
Natiuitie to this instant, and haue nothing at his hands
for my seruice but blowes. When I am cold, he heates
me with beating: when I am warme, he cooles me with
beating: I am wak'd with it when I sleepe, rais'd with
it when I sit, driuen out of doores with it when I goe
from home, welcom'd home with it when I returne, nay
I beare it on my shoulders, as a begger woont her brat:

<p id="id03696">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. How is the man esteem'd heere in the Citie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold. Of very reuerent reputation sir,<br>

Of credit infinite, highly belou'd,<br>

Good sir draw neere to me, Ile speake to him:<br>

Signior Antipholus, I wonder much<br>

That you would put me to this shame and trouble,<br>

And not without some scandall to your selfe,<br>

With circumstance and oaths, so to denie<br>

This Chaine, which now you weare so openly.<br>

Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,<br>

You haue done wrong to this my honest friend,<br>

Who but for staying on our Controuersie,<br>

Had hoisted saile, and put to sea to day:<br>

This Chaine you had of me, can you deny it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I thinke I had, I neuer did deny it<br>

<p id="id03700"> Mar. Yes that you did sir, and forswore it too</p><br>

Fie on thee wretch, 'tis pitty that thou liu'st<br>

To walke where any honest men resort<br>

<p id="id03702">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Thou art a Villaine to impeach me thus,<br>

Ile proue mine honor, and mine honestie<br>

Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. I dare and do defie thee for a villaine.<br>

<p id="id03711"> Ab. How long hath this possession held the man</p><br>

<p id="id03712">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. This weeke he hath beene heauie, sower sad,<br>

And much different from the man he was:<br>

But till this afternoone his passion<br>

Ne're brake into extremity of rage<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03713">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ab. Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea,<br>

Buried some deere friend, hath not else his eye<br>

Stray'd his affection in vnlawfull loue,<br>

A sinne preuailing much in youthfull men,<br>

Who giue their eies the liberty of gazing.<br>

Which of these sorrowes is he subiect too?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. To none of these, except it be the last,<br>

Namely, some loue that drew him oft from home<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03714"> Ab. You should for that haue reprehended him</p><br>

<p id="id03715"> Adr. Why so I did</p><br>

<p id="id03716"> Ab. I but not rough enough</p><br>

<p id="id03717"> Adr. As roughly as my modestie would let me</p><br>

<p id="id03718"> Ab. Haply in priuate</p><br>

<p id="id03719"> Adr. And in assemblies too</p><br>

<p id="id03720"> Ab. I, but not enough</p><br>

<p id="id03721">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. It was the copie of our Conference.<br>

In bed he slept not for my vrging it,<br>

At boord he fed not for my vrging it:<br>

Alone, it was the subiect of my Theame:<br>

In company I often glanced it:<br>

Still did I tell him, it was vilde and bad<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03722">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ab. And thereof came it, that the man was mad.<br>

The venome clamors of a iealous woman,<br>

Poisons more deadly then a mad dogges tooth.<br>

It seemes his sleepes were hindred by thy railing,<br>

And thereof comes it that his head is light.<br>

Thou saist his meate was sawc'd with thy vpbraidings,<br>

Vnquiet meales make ill digestions,<br>

Thereof the raging fire of feauer bred,<br>

And what's a Feauer, but a fit of madnesse?<br>

Thou sayest his sports were hindred by thy bralles.<br>

Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue<br>

But moodie and dull melancholly,<br>

Kinsman to grim and comfortlesse dispaire,<br>

And at her heeles a huge infectious troope<br>

Of pale distemperatures, and foes to life?<br>

In food, in sport, and life-preseruing rest<br>

To be disturb'd, would mad or man, or beast:<br>

The consequence is then, thy iealous fits<br>

Hath scar'd thy husband from the vse of wits<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03723">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. She neuer reprehended him but mildely,<br>

When he demean'd himselfe, rough, rude, and wildly,<br>

Why beare you these rebukes, and answer not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Adri. She did betray me to my owne reproofe,<br>

Good people enter, and lay hold on him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03724"> Ab. No, not a creature enters in my house</p><br>

<p id="id03725">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad. Then let your seruants bring my husband forth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ab. Neither: he tooke this place for sanctuary,<br>

And it shall priuiledge him from your hands,<br>

Till I haue brought him to his wits againe,<br>

Or loose my labour in assaying it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03726">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,<br>

Diet his sicknesse, for it is my Office,<br>

And will haue no atturney but my selfe,<br>

And therefore let me haue him home with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03727">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ab. Be patient, for I will not let him stirre,<br>

Till I haue vs'd the approoued meanes I haue,<br>

With wholsome sirrups, drugges, and holy prayers<br>

To make of him a formall man againe:<br>

It is a branch and parcell of mine oath,<br>

A charitable dutie of my order,<br>

Therefore depart, and leaue him heere with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03728">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. I will not hence, and leaue my husband heere:<br>

And ill it doth beseeme your holinesse<br>

To separate the husband and the wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03729"> Ab. Be quiet and depart, thou shalt not haue him</p><br>

<p id="id03730"> Luc. Complaine vnto the Duke of this indignity</p><br>

<p id="id03731">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. Come go, I will fall prostrate at his feete,<br>

And neuer rise vntill my teares and prayers<br>

Haue won his grace to come in person hither,<br>

And take perforce my husband from the Abbesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03732">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. By this I thinke the Diall points at fiue:<br>

Anon I'me sure the Duke himselfe in person<br>

Comes this way to the melancholly vale;<br>

The place of depth, and sorrie execution,<br>

Behinde the ditches of the Abbey heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03733">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold. Vpon what cause?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. To see a reuerent Siracusian Merchant,<br>

Who put vnluckily into this Bay<br>

Against the Lawes and Statutes of this Towne,<br>

Beheaded publikely for his offence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03734">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold. See where they come, we wil behold his death<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Kneele to the Duke before he passe the Abbey.<br>

<p id="id03735">Enter the Duke of Ephesus, and the Merchant of Siracuse bare
head, with
the Headsman, &amp; other Officers.</p><br>

If any friend will pay the summe for him,<br>

He shall not die, so much we tender him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03737"> Adr. Iustice most sacred Duke against the Abbesse</p><br>

<p id="id03738">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. She is a vertuous and a reuerend Lady,<br>

It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03739">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husba[n]d,<br>

Who I made Lord of me, and all I had,<br>

At your important Letters this ill day,<br>

A most outragious fit of madnesse tooke him:<br>

That desp'rately he hurried through the streete,<br>

With him his bondman, all as mad as he,<br>

Doing displeasure to the Citizens,<br>

By rushing in their houses: bearing thence<br>

Rings, Iewels, any thing his rage did like.<br>

Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,<br>

Whil'st to take order for the wrongs I went,<br>

That heere and there his furie had committed,<br>

Anon I wot not, by what strong escape<br>

He broke from those that had the guard of him,<br>

And with his mad attendant and himselfe,<br>

Each one with irefull passion, with drawne swords<br>

Met vs againe, and madly bent on vs<br>

Chac'd vs away: till raising of more aide<br>

We came againe to binde them: then they fled<br>

Into this Abbey, whether we pursu'd them,<br>

And heere the Abbesse shuts the gates on vs,<br>

And will not suffer vs to fetch him out,<br>

Nor send him forth, that we may beare him hence.<br>

Therefore most gracious Duke with thy command,<br>

Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for helpe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03740">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Long since thy husband seru'd me in my wars<br>

And I to thee ingag'd a Princes word,<br>

When thou didst make him Master of thy bed,<br>

To do him all the grace and good I could.<br>

Go some of you, knocke at the Abbey gate,<br>

And bid the Lady Abbesse come to me:<br>

I will determine this before I stirre.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03741">Enter a Messenger.</p><br>

<p id="id03742">Oh Mistris, Mistris, shift and saue your selfe,<br>

My Master and his man are both broke loose,<br>

Beaten the Maids a-row, and bound the Doctor,<br>

Whose beard they haue sindg'd off with brands of fire,<br>

And euer as it blaz'd, they threw on him<br>

Great pailes of puddled myre to quench the haire;<br>

My Mr preaches patience to him, and the while<br>

His man with Cizers nickes him like a foole:<br>

And sure (vnlesse you send some present helpe)<br>

Betweene them they will kill the Coniurer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03743">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. Peace foole, thy Master and his man are here,<br>

And that is false thou dost report to vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03744">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. Mistris, vpon my life I tel you true,<br>

I haue not breath'd almost since I did see it.<br>

He cries for you, and vowes if he can take you,<br>

To scorch your face, and to disfigure you:<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03745">Cry within.</p><br>

<p id="id03746">Harke, harke, I heare him Mistris: flie, be gone</p><br>

<p id="id03747">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Come stand by me, feare nothing: guard with<br>

Halberds<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03748">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. Ay me, it is my husband: witnesse you,<br>

That he is borne about inuisible,<br>

Euen now we hous'd him in the Abbey heere.<br>

And now he's there, past thought of humane reason.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03749">Enter Antipholus, and E.Dromio of Ephesus.</p><br>

<p id="id03750">&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. Iustice most gracious Duke, oh grant me iustice,<br>

Euen for the seruice that long since I did thee,<br>

When I bestrid thee in the warres, and tooke<br>

Deepe scarres to saue thy life; euen for the blood<br>

That then I lost for thee, now grant me iustice<br>

She whom thou gau'st to me to be my wife;<br>

That hath abused and dishonored me,<br>

Euen in the strength and height of iniurie:<br>

Beyond imagination is the wrong<br>

That she this day hath shamelesse throwne on me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03753"> Duke. Discouer how, and thou shalt finde me iust</p><br>

<p id="id03754">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. This day (great Duke) she shut the doores<br>

vpon me,<br>

While she with Harlots feasted in my house<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03755">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. A greeuous fault: say woman, didst thou so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. No my good Lord. My selfe, he, and my sister,<br>

To day did dine together: so befall my soule,<br>

As this is false he burthens me withall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03756">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Nere may I looke on day, nor sleepe on night,<br>

But she tels to your Highnesse simple truth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03757">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold. O periur'd woman! They are both forsworne,<br>

In this the Madman iustly chargeth them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03758">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. My Liege, I am aduised what I say,<br>

Neither disturbed with the effect of Wine,<br>

Nor headie-rash prouoak'd with raging ire,<br>

Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.<br>

This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;<br>

That Goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,<br>

Could witnesse it: for he was with me then,<br>

Who parted with me to go fetch a Chaine,<br>

Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>

Where Balthasar and I did dine together.<br>

Our dinner done, and he not comming thither,<br>

I went to seeke him. In the street I met him,<br>

And in his companie that Gentleman.<br>

There did this periur'd Goldsmith sweare me downe,<br>

That I this day of him receiu'd the Chaine,<br>

Which God he knowes, I saw not. For the which,<br>

He did arrest me with an Officer.<br>

I did obey, and sent my Pesant home<br>

For certaine Duckets: he with none return'd.<br>

Then fairely I bespoke the Officer<br>

To go in person with me to my house.<br>

By'th' way, we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more<br>

Of vilde Confederates: Along with them<br>

They brought one Pinch, a hungry leane-fac'd Villaine;<br>

A meere Anatomie, a Mountebanke,<br>

A thred-bare Iugler, and a Fortune-teller,<br>

A needy-hollow-ey'd-sharpe-looking-wretch;<br>

A liuing dead man. This pernicious slaue,<br>

Forsooth tooke on him as a Coniurer:<br>

And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>

And with no-face (as 'twere) out-facing me,<br>

Cries out, I was possest. Then altogether<br>

They fell vpon me, bound me, bore me thence,<br>

And in a darke and dankish vault at home<br>

There left me and my man, both bound together,<br>

Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>

I gain'd my freedome; and immediately<br>

Ran hether to your Grace, whom I beseech<br>

To giue me ample satisfaction<br>

For these deepe shames, and great indignities<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03759">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold. My Lord, in truth, thus far I witnes with him:<br>

That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03760">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. But had he such a Chaine of thee, or no?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold. He had my Lord, and when he ran in heere,<br>

These people saw the Chaine about his necke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03761">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Besides, I will be sworne these eares of mine,<br>

Heard you confesse you had the Chaine of him,<br>

After you first forswore it on the Mart,<br>

And thereupon I drew my sword on you:<br>

And then you fled into this Abbey heere,<br>

From whence I thinke you are come by Miracle<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03762">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. I neuer came within these Abbey wals,<br>

Nor euer didst thou draw thy sword on me:<br>

I neuer saw the Chaine, so helpe me heauen:<br>

And this is false you burthen me withall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03763">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Why what an intricate impeach is this?<br>

I thinke you all haue drunke of Circes cup:<br>

If heere you hous'd him, heere he would haue bin.<br>

If he were mad, he would not pleade so coldly:<br>

You say he din'd at home, the Goldsmith heere<br>

Denies that saying. Sirra, what say you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. Sir he din'de with her there, at the Porpentine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03764"> Cur. He did, and from my finger snacht that Ring</p><br>

<p id="id03765"> E.Anti. Tis true (my Liege) this Ring I had of her</p><br>

<p id="id03766">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Saw'st thou him enter at the Abbey heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Curt. As sure (my Liege) as I do see your Grace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03767">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Why this is straunge: Go call the Abbesse hither.<br>

I thinke you are all mated, or starke mad.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03768">Exit one to the Abbesse.</p><br>

<p id="id03769">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:<br>

Haply I see a friend will saue my life,<br>

And pay the sum that may deliuer me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03770"> Duke. Speake freely Siracusian what thou wilt</p><br>

<p id="id03771">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fath. Is not your name sir call'd Antipholus?<br>

And is not that your bondman Dromio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. Within this houre I was his bondman sir,<br>

But he I thanke him gnaw'd in two my cords,<br>

Now am I Dromio, and his man, vnbound<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03772"> Fath. I am sure you both of you remember me</p><br>

<p id="id03773">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. Our selues we do remember sir by you:<br>

For lately we were bound as you are now.<br>

You are not Pinches patient, are you sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Father. Why looke you strange on me? you know<br>

me well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03774"> E.Ant. I neuer saw you in my life till now</p><br>

<p id="id03775">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. Oh! griefe hath chang'd me since you saw me last,<br>

And carefull houres with times deformed hand,<br>

Haue written strange defeatures in my face:<br>

But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Neither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03776">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat. Dromio, nor thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dro. No trust me sir, nor I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03777">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. I am sure thou dost?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dromio. I sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoeuer<br>

a man denies, you are now bound to beleeue him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03778">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fath. Not know my voice, oh times extremity<br>

Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poore tongue<br>

In seuen short yeares, that heere my onely sonne<br>

Knowes not my feeble key of vntun'd cares?<br>

Though now this grained face of mine be hid<br>

In sap-consuming Winters drizled snow,<br>

And all the Conduits of my blood froze vp:<br>

Yet hath my night of life some memorie:<br>

My wasting lampes some fading glimmer left;<br>

My dull deafe eares a little vse to heare:<br>

All these old witnesses, I cannot erre.<br>

Tell me, thou art my sonne Antipholus<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03779"> Ant. I neuer saw my Father in my life</p><br>

<p id="id03780">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. But seuen yeares since, in Siracusa boy<br>

Thou know'st we parted, but perhaps my sonne,<br>

Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in miserie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. The Duke, and all that know me in the City,<br>

Can witnesse with me that it is not so.<br>

I ne're saw Siracusa in my life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I tell thee Siracusian, twentie yeares<br>

Haue I bin Patron to Antipholus,<br>

During which time, he ne're saw Siracusa:<br>

I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03783">Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus Siracusa, and Dromio Sir.</p><br>

<p id="id03784" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Abbesse. Most mightie Duke, behold a man much
wrong'd.</p><br>

<p id="id03785">All gather to see them.</p><br>

<p id="id03786"> Adr. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceiue me</p><br>

<p id="id03787">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. One of these men is genius to the other:<br>

And so of these, which is the naturall man,<br>

And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dromio. I Sir am Dromio, command him away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03788"> E.Dro. I Sir am Dromio, pray let me stay</p><br>

<p id="id03789"> S.Ant. Egeon art thou not? or else his ghost</p><br>

<p id="id03790">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Drom. Oh my olde Master, who hath bound him<br>

heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Abb. Who euer bound him, I will lose his bonds,<br>

And gaine a husband by his libertie:<br>

Speake olde Egeon, if thou bee'st the man<br>

That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,<br>

That bore thee at a burthen two faire sonnes?<br>

Oh if thou bee'st the same Egeon, speake:<br>

And speake vnto the same Aemilia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03791">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Why heere begins his Morning storie right:<br>

These two Antipholus, these two so like,<br>

And these two Dromio's, one in semblance:<br>

Besides her vrging of her wracke at sea,<br>

These are the parents to these children,<br>

Which accidentally are met together<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03792">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. If I dreame not, thou art Aemilia,<br>

If thou art she, tell me, where is that sonne<br>

That floated with thee on the fatall rafte<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03793">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abb. By men of Epidamium, he, and I,<br>

And the twin Dromio, all were taken vp;<br>

But by and by, rude Fishermen of Corinth<br>

By force tooke Dromio, and my sonne from them,<br>

And me they left with those of Epidamium.<br>

What then became of them, I cannot tell:<br>

I, to this fortune that you see mee in<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03794"> Duke. Antipholus thou cam'st from Corinth first</p><br>

<p id="id03795"> S.Ant. No sir, not I, I came from Siracuse</p><br>

<p id="id03796"> Duke. Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which</p><br>

<p id="id03797">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. I came from Corinth my most gracious Lord<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. And I with him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03798">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. Brought to this Town by that most famous<br>

Warriour,<br>

Duke Menaphon your most renowned Vnckle<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03799">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. Which of you two did dine with me to day?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Ant. I, gentle Mistris<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03800">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. And are not you my husband?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. No, I say nay to that<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03801">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Ant. And so do I, yet did she call me so:<br>

And this faire Gentlewoman her sister heere<br>

Did call me brother. What I told you then,<br>

I hope I shall haue leisure to make good,<br>

If this be not a dreame I see and heare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03802">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldsmith. That is the Chaine sir, which you had of<br>

mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03803"> S.Ant. I thinke it be sir, I denie it not</p><br>

<p id="id03804"> E.Ant. And you sir for this Chaine arrested me</p><br>

<p id="id03805"> Gold. I thinke I did sir, I deny it not</p><br>

<p id="id03806">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adr. I sent you monie sir to be your baile<br>

By Dromio, but I thinke he brought it not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03807"> E.Dro. No, none by me</p><br>

<p id="id03808">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Ant. This purse of Duckets I receiu'd from you,<br>

And Dromio my man did bring them me:<br>

I see we still did meete each others man,<br>

And I was tane for him, and he for me,<br>

And thereupon these errors are arose<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03809"> E.Ant. These Duckets pawne I for my father heere</p><br>

<p id="id03810"> Duke. It shall not neede, thy father hath his life</p><br>

<p id="id03811"> Cur. Sir I must haue that Diamond from you</p><br>

<p id="id03812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Ant. There take it, and much thanks for my good<br>

cheere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abb. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the paines<br>

To go with vs into the Abbey heere,<br>

And heare at large discoursed all our fortunes,<br>

And all that are assembled in this place:<br>

And we shall make full satisfaction.<br>

Thirtie three yeares haue I but gone in trauaile<br>

Of you my sonnes, and till this present houre<br>

My heauie burthen are deliuered:<br>

The Duke my husband, and my children both,<br>

And you the Kalenders of their Natiuity,<br>

Go to a Gossips feast, and go with mee,<br>

After so long greefe such Natiuitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03814"> Duke. With all my heart, Ile Gossip at this feast.</p><br>

<p id="id03815">Exeunt. omnes. Manet the two Dromio's and two Brothers.</p><br>

<p id="id03816">&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Mast[er]. shall I fetch your stuffe from shipbord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.An. Dromio, what stuffe of mine hast thou imbarkt<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Ant. He speakes to me, I am your master Dromio.<br>

Come go with vs, wee'l looke to that anon,<br>

Embrace thy brother there, reioyce with him.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03818">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id03819">&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. There is a fat friend at your masters house,<br>

That kitchin'd me for you to day at dinner:<br>

She now shall be my sister, not my wife,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;E.D. Me thinks you are my glasse, &amp; not my brother:<br>

I see by you, I am a sweet-fac'd youth,<br>

Will you walke in to see their gossipping?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Not I sir, you are my elder<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03820"> E.Dro. That's a question, how shall we trie it</p><br>

<p id="id03821">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.Dro. Wee'l draw Cuts for the Signior, till then,<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id03822">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.Dro. Nay then thus:<br>

We came into the world like brother and brother:<br>

And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.<br>

<p id="id03824">FINIS. The Comedie of Errors.</p><br>

<p id="id03825" style="margin-top: 2em">Much adoe about Nothing</p><br>

<p id="id03826">Actus primus, Scena prima.</p><br>

<p id="id03827">Enter Leonato Gouernour of Messina, Innogen his wife, Hero his
daughter,
and Beatrice his Neece, with a messenger.</p><br>

<p id="id03828">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. I learne in this Letter, that Don Peter of Arragon,<br>

comes this night to Messina<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03829">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. He is very neere by this: he was not<br>

three Leagues off when I left him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03830">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. How many Gentlemen haue you lost in this<br>

action?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. But few of any sort, and none of name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03831"> Leon. A victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer
brings home full numbers: I finde heere, that Don Peter
hath bestowed much honor on a yong Florentine, called
Claudio</p><br>

<p id="id03832"> Mess. Much deseru'd on his part, and equally remembred
by Don Pedro, he hath borne himselfe beyond the
promise of his age, doing in the figure of a Lambe, the
feats of a Lion, he hath indeede better bettred expectation,
then you must expect of me to tell you how</p><br>

<p id="id03833" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leo. He hath an Vnckle heere in Messina, wil be very
much glad of it</p><br>

<p id="id03834"> Mess. I haue alreadie deliuered him letters, and there
appeares much ioy in him, euen so much, that ioy could
not shew it selfe modest enough, without a badg of bitternesse</p><br>

<p id="id03835">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Did he breake out into teares?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. In great measure<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03836"> Leo. A kinde ouerflow of kindnesse, there are no faces
truer, then those that are so wash'd, how much better
is it to weepe at ioy, then to ioy at weeping?
 Bea. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from
the warres, or no?
 Mess. I know none of that name, Lady, there was
none such in the armie of any sort</p><br>

<p id="id03837">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. What is he that you aske for Neece?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. My cousin meanes Signior Benedick of Padua<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. O he's return'd, and as pleasant as euer he was<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03838"> Beat. He set vp his bils here in Messina, &amp; challeng'd
Cupid at the Flight: and my Vnckles foole reading the
Challenge, subscrib'd for Cupid, and challeng'd him at
the Burbolt. I pray you, how many hath hee kil'd and
eaten in these warres? But how many hath he kil'd? for
indeed, I promis'd to eate all of his killing</p><br>

<p id="id03839" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leon. 'Faith Neece, you taxe Signior Benedicke too
much, but hee'l be meete with you, I doubt it not</p><br>

<p id="id03840"> Mess. He hath done good seruice Lady in these wars</p><br>

<p id="id03841"> Beat. You had musty victuall, and he hath holpe to
ease it: he's a very valiant Trencher-man, hee hath an
excellent stomacke</p><br>

<p id="id03842"> Mess. And a good souldier too Lady</p><br>

<p id="id03843">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. And a good souldier to a Lady. But what is he<br>

to a Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, stuft with<br>

all honourable vertues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03844">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. It is so indeed, he is no lesse then a stuft man:<br>

but for the stuffing well, we are all mortall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03845"> Leon. You must not (sir) mistake my Neece, there is
a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick, &amp; her:
they neuer meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between
them</p><br>

<p id="id03846"> Bea. Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict,
foure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is
the whole man gouern'd with one: so that if hee haue
wit enough to keepe himselfe warme, let him beare it
for a difference betweene himselfe and his horse: For it
is all the wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a reasonable
creature. Who is his companion now? He hath
euery month a new sworne brother</p><br>

<p id="id03847">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. Is't possible?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Very easily possible: he weares his faith but as<br>

the fashion of his hat, it euer changes with y next block<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03848">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. I see (Lady) the Gentleman is not in your<br>

bookes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03849">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bea. No, and he were, I would burne my study. But<br>

I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young<br>

squarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the<br>

diuell?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. He is most in the company of the right noble<br>

Claudio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03850"> Beat. O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a disease:
he is sooner caught then the pestilence, and the taker
runs presently mad. God helpe the noble Claudio, if hee
haue caught the Benedict, it will cost him a thousand
pound ere he be cur'd</p><br>

<p id="id03851"> Mess. I will hold friends with you Lady</p><br>

<p id="id03852"> Bea. Do good friend</p><br>

<p id="id03853"> Leo. You'l ne're run mad Neece</p><br>

<p id="id03854"> Bea. No, not till a hot Ianuary</p><br>

<p id="id03855"> Mess. Don Pedro is approach'd.</p><br>

<p id="id03856">Enter don Pedro, Claudio, Benedicke, Balthasar, and Iohn the
bastard.</p><br>

<p id="id03857"> Pedro. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet
your trouble: the fashion of the world is to auoid cost,
and you encounter it</p><br>

<p id="id03858"> Leon. Neuer came trouble to my house in the likenes
of your Grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
remaine: but when you depart from me, sorrow abides,
and happinesse takes his leaue</p><br>

<p id="id03859" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pedro. You embrace your charge too willingly: I
thinke this is your daughter</p><br>

<p id="id03860"> Leonato. Her mother hath many times told me so</p><br>

<p id="id03861">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bened. Were you in doubt that you askt her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. Signior Benedicke, no, for then were you a<br>

childe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03862"> Pedro. You haue it full Benedicke, we may ghesse by
this, what you are, being a man, truely the Lady fathers
her selfe: be happie Lady, for you are like an honorable
father</p><br>

<p id="id03863"> Ben. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
haue his head on her shoulders for al Messina, as like him
as she is</p><br>

<p id="id03864">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. I wonder that you will still be talking, signior<br>

Benedicke, no body markes you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03865"> Ben. What my deere Ladie Disdaine! are you yet
liuing?
 Beat. Is it possible Disdaine should die, while shee
hath such meete foode to feede it, as Signior Benedicke?
Curtesie it selfe must conuert to Disdaine, if you come in
her presence</p><br>

<p id="id03866">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Then is curtesie a turne-coate, but it is certaine<br>

I am loued of all Ladies, onely you excepted: and<br>

I would I could finde in my heart that I had not a hard<br>

heart, for truely I loue none<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03867"> Beat. A deere happinesse to women, they would else
haue beene troubled with a pernitious Suter, I thanke
God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that, I
had rather heare my Dog barke at a Crow, than a man
sweare he loues me</p><br>

<p id="id03868"> Bene. God keepe your Ladiship still in that minde,
so some Gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
scratcht face</p><br>

<p id="id03869" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. Scratching could not make it worse, and 'twere
such a face as yours were</p><br>

<p id="id03870"> Bene. Well, you are a rare Parrat teacher</p><br>

<p id="id03871" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. A bird of my tongue, is better than a beast of
your</p><br>

<p id="id03872"> Ben. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,
and so good a continuer, but keepe your way a Gods
name, I haue done</p><br>

<p id="id03873" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. You alwaies end with a Iades tricke, I know
you of old</p><br>

<p id="id03874"> Pedro. This is the summe of all: Leonato, signior Claudio,
and signior Benedicke; my deere friend Leonato, hath
inuited you all, I tell him we shall stay here, at the least
a moneth, and he heartily praies some occasion may detaine
vs longer: I dare sweare hee is no hypocrite, but
praies from his heart</p><br>

<p id="id03875"> Leon. If you sweare, my Lord, you shall not be forsworne,
let mee bid you welcome, my Lord, being reconciled
to the Prince your brother: I owe you all
duetie</p><br>

<p id="id03876">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I thanke you, I am not of many words, but I<br>

thanke you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03877">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Please it your grace leade on?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Your hand Leonato, we will goe together.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03878">Exeunt. Manet Benedicke and Claudio.</p><br>

<p id="id03879">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Benedicke, didst thou note the daughter of signior<br>

Leonato?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. I noted her not, but I lookt on her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03880">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Is she not a modest yong Ladie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Doe you question me as an honest man should<br>

doe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue<br>

me speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant<br>

to their sexe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. No, I pray thee speake in sober iudgement<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03881"> Bene. Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie
praise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for a
great praise, onely this commendation I can affoord her,
that were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,
and being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her</p><br>

<p id="id03882">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Thou think'st I am in sport, I pray thee tell me<br>

truely how thou lik'st her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03883">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Would you buie her, that you enquier after<br>

her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Can the world buie such a iewell?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you this<br>

with a sad brow? Or doe you play the flowting iacke, to<br>

tell vs Cupid is a good Hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare<br>

Carpenter: Come, in what key shall a man take you to<br>

goe in the song?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. In mine eie, she is the sweetest Ladie that euer<br>

I lookt on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03884"> Bene. I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no
such matter: there's her cosin, and she were not possest
with a furie, exceedes her as much in beautie, as the first
of Maie doth the last of December: but I hope you haue
no intent to turne husband, haue you?
 Clau. I would scarce trust my selfe, though I had
sworne the contrarie, if Hero would be my wife</p><br>

<p id="id03885"> Bene. Ist come to this? in faith hath not the world one
man but he will weare his cap with suspition? shall I neuer
see a batcheller of three score againe? goe to yfaith,
and thou wilt needes thrust thy necke into a yoke, weare
the print of it, and sigh away sundaies: looke, don Pedro
is returned to seeke you.</p><br>

<p id="id03886">Enter don Pedro, Iohn the bastard.</p><br>

<p id="id03887">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedr. What secret hath held you here, that you followed<br>

not to Leonatoes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bened. I would your Grace would constraine mee to<br>

tell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03888"> Pedro. I charge thee on thy allegeance</p><br>

<p id="id03889"> Ben. You heare, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a
dumbe man, I would haue you thinke so (but on my allegiance,
marke you this, on my allegiance) hee is in
loue, With who? now that is your Graces part: marke
how short his answere is, with Hero, Leonatoes short
daughter</p><br>

<p id="id03890"> Clau. If this were so, so were it vttred</p><br>

<p id="id03891">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bened. Like the old tale, my Lord, it is not so, nor 'twas<br>

not so: but indeede, God forbid it should be so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03892">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it<br>

should be otherwise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03893">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Amen, if you loue her, for the Ladie is verie<br>

well worthie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03894"> Clau. You speake this to fetch me in, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03895"> Pedr. By my troth I speake my thought</p><br>

<p id="id03896"> Clau. And in faith, my Lord, I spoke mine</p><br>

<p id="id03897" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bened. And by my two faiths and troths, my Lord, I
speake mine</p><br>

<p id="id03898"> Clau. That I loue her, I feele</p><br>

<p id="id03899"> Pedr. That she is worthie, I know</p><br>

<p id="id03900"> Bened. That I neither feele how shee should be loued,
nor know how shee should be worthie, is the
opinion that fire cannot melt out of me, I will die in it at
the stake</p><br>

<p id="id03901" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pedr. Thou wast euer an obstinate heretique in the despight
of Beautie</p><br>

<p id="id03902"> Clau. And neuer could maintaine his part, but in the
force of his will
 Ben. That a woman conceiued me, I thanke her: that
she brought mee vp, I likewise giue her most humble
thankes: but that I will haue a rechate winded in my
forehead, or hang my bugle in an inuisible baldricke, all
women shall pardon me: because I will not do them the
wrong to mistrust any, I will doe my selfe the right to
trust none: and the fine is, (for the which I may goe the
finer) I will liue a Batchellor</p><br>

<p id="id03903"> Pedro. I shall see thee ere I die, looke pale with loue</p><br>

<p id="id03904"> Bene. With anger, with sicknesse, or with hunger,
my Lord, not with loue: proue that euer I loose more
blood with loue, then I will get againe with drinking,
picke out mine eyes with a Ballet-makers penne, and
hang me vp at the doore of a brothel-house for the signe
of blinde Cupid</p><br>

<p id="id03905" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pedro. Well, if euer thou doost fall from this faith,
thou wilt proue a notable argument</p><br>

<p id="id03906"> Bene. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a Cat, &amp; shoot
at me, and he that hit's me, let him be clapt on the shoulder,
and cal'd Adam</p><br>

<p id="id03907">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Well, as time shall trie: In time the sauage<br>

Bull doth beare the yoake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03908"> Bene. The sauage bull may, but if euer the sensible
Benedicke beare it, plucke off the bulles hornes, and set
them in my forehead, and let me be vildely painted, and
in such great Letters as they write, heere is good horse
to hire: let them signifie vnder my signe, here you may
see Benedicke the married man</p><br>

<p id="id03909">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. If this should euer happen, thou wouldst bee<br>

horne mad<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03910">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Nay, if Cupid haue not spent all his Quiuer in<br>

Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03911"> Bene. I looke for an earthquake too then</p><br>

<p id="id03912"> Pedro. Well, you will temporize with the houres, in
the meane time, good Signior Benedicke, repaire to Leonatoes,
commend me to him, and tell him I will not faile
him at supper, for indeede he hath made great preparation</p><br>

<p id="id03913">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. I haue almost matter enough in me for such an<br>

Embassage, and so I commit you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03914">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. To the tuition of God. From my house, if I<br>

had it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03915"> Pedro. The sixt of Iuly. Your louing friend, Benedick</p><br>

<p id="id03916"> Bene. Nay mocke not, mocke not; the body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the
guardes are but slightly basted on neither, ere you flout
old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I
leaue you.</p><br>

<p id="id03917">Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id03918">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. My Liege, your Highnesse now may doe mee<br>

good<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03919">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. My loue is thine to teach, teach it but how,<br>

And thou shalt see how apt it is to learne<br>

Any hard Lesson that may do thee good<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03920">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Hath Leonato any sonne my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. No childe but Hero, she's his onely heire.<br>

Dost thou affect her Claudio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. O my Lord,<br>

When you went onward on this ended action,<br>

I look'd vpon her with a souldiers eie,<br>

That lik'd, but had a rougher taske in hand,<br>

Than to driue liking to the name of loue:<br>

But now I am return'd, and that warre-thoughts<br>

Haue left their places vacant: in their roomes,<br>

Come thronging soft and delicate desires,<br>

All prompting mee how faire yong Hero is,<br>

Saying I lik'd her ere I went to warres<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03921">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Thou wilt be like a louer presently,<br>

And tire the hearer with a booke of words:<br>

If thou dost loue faire Hero, cherish it,<br>

And I will breake with her: wast not to this end,<br>

That thou beganst to twist so fine a story?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. How sweetly doe you minister to loue,<br>

That know loues griefe by his complexion!<br>

But lest my liking might too sodaine seeme,<br>

I would haue salu'd it with a longer treatise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03922">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ped. What need y bridge much broder then the flood?<br>

The fairest graunt is the necessitie:<br>

Looke what will serue, is fit: 'tis once, thou louest,<br>

And I will fit thee with the remedie,<br>

I know we shall haue reuelling to night,<br>

I will assume thy part in some disguise,<br>

And tell faire Hero I am Claudio,<br>

And in her bosome Ile vnclaspe my heart,<br>

And take her hearing prisoner with the force<br>

And strong incounter of my amorous tale:<br>

Then after, to her father will I breake,<br>

And the conclusion is, shee shall be thine,<br>

In practise let vs put it presently.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03923">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id03924">Enter Leonato and an old man, brother to Leonato.</p><br>

<p id="id03925">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. How now brother, where is my cosen your son:<br>

hath he prouided this musicke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Old. He is very busie about it, but brother, I can tell<br>

you newes that you yet dreamt not of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03926"> Lo. Are they good?
 Old. As the euents stamps them, but they haue a good
couer: they shew well outward, the Prince and Count
Claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard,
were thus ouer-heard by a man of mine: the Prince discouered
to Claudio that hee loued my niece your daughter,
and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance,
and if hee found her accordant, hee meant to take the
present time by the top, and instantly breake with you
of it</p><br>

<p id="id03927">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Old. A good sharpe fellow, I will send for him, and<br>

question him your selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03928"> Leo. No, no; wee will hold it as a dreame, till it appeare
it selfe: but I will acquaint my daughter withall,
that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peraduenture
this bee true: goe you and tell her of it: coosins,
you know what you haue to doe, O I crie you mercie
friend, goe you with mee and I will vse your skill,
good cosin haue a care this busie time.</p><br>

<p id="id03929">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id03930">Enter Sir Iohn the Bastard, and Conrade his companion.</p><br>

<p id="id03931">&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. What the good yeere my Lord, why are you<br>

thus out of measure sad?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,<br>

therefore the sadnesse is without limit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03932"> Con. You should heare reason</p><br>

<p id="id03933">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. And when I haue heard it, what blessing bringeth<br>

it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. If not a present remedy, yet a patient sufferance<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03934"> Ioh. I wonder that thou (being as thou saist thou art,
borne vnder Saturne) goest about to apply a morall medicine,
to a mortifying mischiefe: I cannot hide what I
am: I must bee sad when I haue cause, and smile at no
mans iests, eat when I haue stomacke, and wait for no
mans leisure: sleepe when I am drowsie, and tend on no
mans businesse, laugh when I am merry, and claw no man
in his humor</p><br>

<p id="id03935"> Con. Yea, but you must not make the ful show of this,
till you may doe it without controllment, you haue of
late stood out against your brother, and hee hath tane
you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you
should take root, but by the faire weather that you make
your selfe, it is needful that you frame the season for your
owne haruest</p><br>

<p id="id03936"> Iohn. I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a rose
in his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be disdain'd of
all, then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any: in this
(though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man)
it must not be denied but I am a plaine dealing villaine, I
am trusted with a mussell, and enfranchisde with a clog,
therefore I haue decreed, not to sing in my cage: if I had
my mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I would do
my liking: in the meane time, let me be that I am, and
seeke not to alter me</p><br>

<p id="id03937">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. Can you make no vse of your discontent?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I will make all vse of it, for I vse it onely.<br>

Who comes here? what newes Borachio?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03938">Enter Borachio.</p><br>

<p id="id03939"> Bor. I came yonder from a great supper, the Prince
your brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can
giue you intelligence of an intended marriage</p><br>

<p id="id03940">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Will it serue for any Modell to build mischiefe<br>

on? What is hee for a foole that betrothes himselfe to<br>

vnquietnesse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Mary it is your brothers right hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03941">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Who, the most exquisite Claudio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Euen he<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03942">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. A proper squier, and who, and who, which way<br>

lookes he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Mary on Hero, the daughter and Heire of Leonato<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03943"> Iohn. A very forward March-chicke, how came you
to this:
 Bor. Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoaking
a musty roome, comes me the Prince and Claudio,
hand in hand in sad conference: I whipt behind the Arras,
and there heard it agreed vpon, that the Prince should
wooe Hero for himselfe, and hauing obtain'd her, giue
her to Count Claudio</p><br>

<p id="id03944"> Iohn. Come, come, let vs thither, this may proue food
to my displeasure, that young start-vp hath all the glorie
of my ouerthrow: if I can crosse him any way, I blesse
my selfe euery way, you are both sure, and will assist
mee?
 Conr. To the death my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id03945">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Let vs to the great supper, their cheere is the<br>

greater that I am subdued, would the Cooke were of my<br>

minde: shall we goe proue whats to be done?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Wee'll wait vpon your Lordship.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03946">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id03947" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Secundus.</p><br>

<p id="id03948">Enter Leonato, his brother, his wife, Hero his daughter, and
Beatrice his
neece, and a kinsman.</p><br>

<p id="id03949">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. Was not Count Iohn here at supper?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother. I saw him not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03950">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice. How tartly that Gentleman lookes, I neuer<br>

can see him, but I am heart-burn'd an howre after<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03951"> Hero. He is of a very melancholy disposition</p><br>

<p id="id03952"> Beatrice. Hee were an excellent man that were made
iust in the mid-way betweene him and Benedicke, the one
is too like an image and saies nothing, and the other too
like my Ladies eldest sonne, euermore tatling</p><br>

<p id="id03953">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Then halfe signior Benedicks tongue in Count<br>

Iohns mouth, and halfe Count Iohns melancholy in Signior<br>

Benedicks face<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03954"> Beat. With a good legge, and a good foot vnckle, and
money enough in his purse, such a man would winne any
woman in the world, if he could get her good will</p><br>

<p id="id03955" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leon. By my troth Neece, thou wilt neuer get thee a
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue</p><br>

<p id="id03956"> Brother. Infaith shee's too curst</p><br>

<p id="id03957"> Beat. Too curst is more then curst, I shall lessen Gods
sending that way: for it is said, God sends a curst Cow
short hornes, but to a Cow too curst he sends none</p><br>

<p id="id03958" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leon. So, by being too curst, God will send you no
hornes</p><br>

<p id="id03959"> Beat. Iust, if he send me no husband, for the which
blessing, I am at him vpon my knees euery morning and
euening: Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen</p><br>

<p id="id03960" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leonato. You may light vpon a husband that hath no
beard</p><br>

<p id="id03961"> Beatrice. What should I doe with him? dresse him in
my apparell, and make him my waiting gentlewoman? he
that hath a beard, is more then a youth: and he that hath
no beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a
youth, is not for mee: and he that is lesse then a man, I am
not for him: therefore I will euen take sixepence in earnest
of the Berrord, and leade his Apes into hell</p><br>

<p id="id03962"> Leon. Well then, goe you into hell</p><br>

<p id="id03963"> Beat. No, but to the gate, and there will the Deuill
meete mee like an old Cuckold with hornes on his head,
and say, get you to heauen Beatrice, get you to heauen,
heere's no place for you maids, so deliuer I vp my Apes,
and away to S[aint]. Peter: for the heauens, hee shewes mee
where the Batchellers sit, and there liue wee as merry as
the day is long</p><br>

<p id="id03964" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Brother. Well neece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
father</p><br>

<p id="id03965"> Beatrice. Yes faith, it is my cosens dutie to make curtsie,
and say, as it please you: but yet for all that cosin, let
him be a handsome fellow, or else make an other cursie,
and say, father, as it please me</p><br>

<p id="id03966" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leonato. Well neece, I hope to see you one day fitted
with a husband</p><br>

<p id="id03967"> Beatrice. Not till God make men of some other mettall
then earth, would it not grieue a woman to be ouermastred
with a peece of valiant dust: to make account of
her life to a clod of waiward marle? no vnckle, ile none:
Adams sonnes are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sinne
to match in my kinred</p><br>

<p id="id03968">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Daughter, remember what I told you, if the<br>

Prince doe solicit you in that kinde, you know your answere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03969"> Beatrice. The fault will be in the musicke cosin, if you
be not woed in good time: if the Prince bee too important,
tell him there is measure in euery thing, &amp; so dance
out the answere, for heare me Hero, wooing, wedding, &amp;
repenting, is as a Scotch jigge, a measure, and a cinquepace:
the first suite is hot and hasty like a Scotch jigge
(and full as fantasticall) the wedding manerly modest,
(as a measure) full of state &amp; aunchentry, and then comes
repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace
faster and faster, till he sinkes into his graue</p><br>

<p id="id03970"> Leonato. Cosin you apprehend passing shrewdly</p><br>

<p id="id03971">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice. I haue a good eye vnckle, I can see a Church<br>

by daylight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03972">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. The reuellers are entring brother, make good<br>

roome.<br>

Enter Prince, Pedro, Claudio, and Benedicke, and Balthasar, or<br>

dumbe Iohn,<br>

Maskers with a drum.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03973">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Lady, will you walke about with your friend?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. So you walke softly, and looke sweetly, and say<br>

nothing, I am yours for the walke, and especially when I<br>

walke away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03974"> Pedro. With me in your company</p><br>

<p id="id03975"> Hero. I may say so when I please</p><br>

<p id="id03976">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. And when please you to say so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. When I like your fauour, for God defend the<br>

Lute should be like the case<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03977">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. My visor is Philemons roofe, within the house<br>

is Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03978"> Hero. Why then your visor should be thatcht</p><br>

<p id="id03979"> Pedro. Speake low if you speake Loue</p><br>

<p id="id03980"> Bene. Well, I would you did like me</p><br>

<p id="id03981">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. So would not I for your owne sake, for I haue<br>

manie ill qualities<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03982">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Which is one?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. I say my prayers alowd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03983"> Ben. I loue you the better, the hearers may cry Amen</p><br>

<p id="id03984"> Mar. God match me with a good dauncer</p><br>

<p id="id03985"> Balt. Amen</p><br>

<p id="id03986" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Mar. And God keepe him out of my sight when the
daunce is done: answer Clarke</p><br>

<p id="id03987"> Balt. No more words, the Clarke is answered</p><br>

<p id="id03988"> Vrsula. I know you well enough, you are Signior Anthonio</p><br>

<p id="id03989"> Anth. At a word, I am not</p><br>

<p id="id03990"> Vrsula. I know you by the wagling of your head</p><br>

<p id="id03991"> Anth. To tell you true, I counterfet him</p><br>

<p id="id03992"> Vrsu. You could neuer doe him so ill well, vnlesse
you were the very man: here's his dry hand vp &amp; down,
you are he, you are he</p><br>

<p id="id03993"> Anth. At a word I am not</p><br>

<p id="id03994"> Vrsula. Come, come, doe you thinke I doe not know
you by your excellent wit? can vertue hide it selfe? goe
to mumme, you are he, graces will appeare, and there's
an end</p><br>

<p id="id03995">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Will you not tell me who told you so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. No, you shall pardon me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03996">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Nor will you not tell me who you are?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bened. Not now<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03997"> Beat. That I was disdainfull, and that I had my good
wit out of the hundred merry tales: well, this was Signior
Benedicke that said so</p><br>

<p id="id03998">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. What's he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. I am sure you know him well enough<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id03999"> Bene. Not I, beleeue me</p><br>

<p id="id04000"> Beat. Did he neuer make you laugh?
 Bene. I pray you what is he?
 Beat. Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole,
onely his gift is, in deuising impossible slanders, none
but Libertines delight in him, and the commendation is
not in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee both pleaseth
men and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and
beat him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had
boorded me</p><br>

<p id="id04001" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bene. When I know the Gentleman, Ile tell him what
you say</p><br>

<p id="id04002"> Beat. Do, do, hee'l but breake a comparison or two
on me, which peraduenture (not markt, or not laugh'd
at) strikes him into melancholly, and then there's a Partridge
wing saued, for the foole will eate no supper that
night. We must follow the Leaders</p><br>

<p id="id04003"> Ben. In euery good thing</p><br>

<p id="id04004" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bea. Nay, if they leade to any ill, I will leaue them
at the next turning.</p><br>

<p id="id04005">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id04006">Musicke for the dance.</p><br>

<p id="id04007"> Iohn. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath
withdrawne her father to breake with him about it: the
Ladies follow her, and but one visor remaines</p><br>

<p id="id04008"> Borachio. And that is Claudio, I know him by his bearing</p><br>

<p id="id04009">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Are not you signior Benedicke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. You know me well, I am hee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04010"> Iohn. Signior, you are verie neere my Brother in his
loue, he is enamor'd on Hero, I pray you disswade him
from her, she is no equall for his birth: you may do the
part of an honest man in it</p><br>

<p id="id04011">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claudio. How know you he loues her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I heard him sweare his affection<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04012">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. So did I too, and he swore he would marrie her<br>

to night<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04013"> Iohn. Come, let vs to the banquet.</p><br>

<p id="id04014">Ex. manet Clau.</p><br>

<p id="id04015">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Thus answere I in name of Benedicke,<br>

But heare these ill newes with the eares of Claudio:<br>

'Tis certaine so, the Prince woes for himselfe:<br>

Friendship is constant in all other things,<br>

Saue in the Office and affaires of loue:<br>

Therefore all hearts in loue vse their owne tongues.<br>

Let euerie eye negotiate for it selfe,<br>

And trust no Agent: for beautie is a witch,<br>

Against whose charmes, faith melteth into blood:<br>

This is an accident of hourely proofe,<br>

Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero.<br>

Enter Benedicke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04016"> Ben. Count Claudio</p><br>

<p id="id04017"> Clau. Yea, the same</p><br>

<p id="id04018"> Ben. Come, will you goe with me?
 Clau. Whither?
 Ben. Euen to the next Willow, about your own businesse,
Count. What fashion will you weare the Garland
off? About your necke, like an Vsurers chaine? Or
vnder your arme, like a Lieutenants scarfe? You must
weare it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero</p><br>

<p id="id04019"> Clau . I wish him ioy of her</p><br>

<p id="id04020">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Why that's spoken like an honest Drouier, so<br>

they sel Bullockes: but did you thinke the Prince wold<br>

haue serued you thus?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. I pray you leaue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04021">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Ho now you strike like the blindman, 'twas the<br>

boy that stole your meate, and you'l beat the post<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04022">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. If it will not be, Ile leaue you.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04023"> Ben. Alas poore hurt fowle, now will he creepe into
sedges: But that my Ladie Beatrice should know me, &amp;
not know me: the Princes foole! Hah? It may be I goe
vnder that title, because I am merrie: yea but so I am
apt to do my selfe wrong: I am not so reputed, it is the
base (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice, that putt's
the world into her person, and so giues me out: well, Ile
be reuenged as I may.
Enter the Prince.</p><br>

<p id="id04024"> Pedro. Now Signior, where's the Count, did you
see him?
 Bene. Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady
Fame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a
Warren, I told him, and I thinke, told him true, that your
grace had got the will of this young Lady, and I offered
him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a
garland, as being forsaken, or to binde him a rod, as being
worthy to be whipt</p><br>

<p id="id04025">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. To be whipt, what's his fault?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. The flat transgression of a Schoole-boy, who<br>

being ouer-ioyed with finding a birds nest, shewes it his<br>

companion, and he steales it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04026">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Wilt thou make a trust, a transgression? the<br>

transgression is in the stealer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04027"> Ben. Yet it had not been amisse the rod had beene
made, and the garland too, for the garland he might haue
worne himselfe, and the rod hee might haue bestowed on
you, who (as I take it) haue stolne his birds nest</p><br>

<p id="id04028">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them<br>

to the owner<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04029">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith<br>

you say honestly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04030"> Pedro. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrell to you, the
Gentleman that daunst with her, told her shee is much
wrong'd by you</p><br>

<p id="id04031"> Bene. O she misusde me past the indurance of a block:
an oake but with one greene leafe on it, would haue answered
her: my very visor began to assume life, and scold
with her: shee told mee, not thinking I had beene my
selfe, that I was the Princes Iester, and that I was duller
then a great thaw, hudling iest vpon iest, with such impossible
conueiance vpon me, that I stood like a man at a
marke, with a whole army shooting at me: shee speakes
poynyards, and euery word stabbes: if her breath were
as terrible as terminations, there were no liuing neere
her, she would infect to the north starre: I would not
marry her, though she were indowed with all that Adam
had left him before he transgrest, she would haue made
 Hercules haue turnd spit, yea, and haue cleft his club to
make the fire too: come, talke not of her, you shall finde
her the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to God
some scholler would coniure her, for certainely while she
is heere, a man may liue as quiet in hell, as in a sanctuary,
and people sinne vpon purpose, because they would goe
thither, so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation
followes her.
Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero.</p><br>

<p id="id04032"> Pedro. Looke heere she comes</p><br>

<p id="id04033"> Bene. Will your Grace command mee any seruice to
the worlds end? I will goe on the slightest arrand now
to the Antypodes that you can deuise to send me on: I
will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the furthest inch
of Asia: bring you the length of Prester Iohns foot: fetch
you a hayre off the great Chams beard: doe you any embassage
to the Pigmies, rather then hould three words
conference, with this Harpy: you haue no employment
for me?
 Pedro. None, but to desire your good company</p><br>

<p id="id04034">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. O God sir, heeres a dish I loue not, I cannot indure<br>

this Lady tongue.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04035">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedr. Come Lady, come, you haue lost the heart of<br>

Signior Benedicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04036"> Beatr. Indeed my Lord, hee lent it me a while, and I
gaue him vse for it, a double heart for a single one, marry
once before he wonne it of mee, with false dice, therefore
your Grace may well say I haue lost it</p><br>

<p id="id04037">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. You haue put him downe Lady, you haue put<br>

him downe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04038">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. So I would not he should do me, my Lord, lest<br>

I should prooue the mother of fooles: I haue brought<br>

Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seeke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04039">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. Why how now Count, wherfore are you sad?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Not sad my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04040">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro. How then? sicke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Neither, my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04041"> Beat. The Count is neither sad, nor sicke, nor merry,
nor well: but ciuill Count, ciuill as an Orange, and something
of a iealous complexion</p><br>

<p id="id04042"> Pedro. Ifaith Lady, I thinke your blazon to be true.
though Ile be sworne, if hee be so, his conceit is false:
heere Claudio, I haue wooed in thy name, and faire Hero
is won, I haue broke with her father, and his good will
obtained, name the day of marriage, and God giue
thee ioy</p><br>

<p id="id04043"> Leona. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her
my fortunes: his grace hath made the match, &amp; all grace
say, Amen to it</p><br>

<p id="id04044"> Beatr. Speake Count, tis your Qu</p><br>

<p id="id04045"> Claud. Silence is the perfectest Herault of ioy, I were
but little happy if I could say, how much? Lady, as you
are mine, I am yours, I giue away my selfe for you, and
doat vpon the exchange</p><br>

<p id="id04046" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. Speake cosin, or (if you cannot) stop his mouth
with a kisse, and let not him speake neither</p><br>

<p id="id04047"> Pedro. In faith Lady you haue a merry heart</p><br>

<p id="id04048"> Beatr. Yea my Lord I thanke it, poore foole it keepes
on the windy side of Care, my coosin tells him in his eare
that he is in my heart</p><br>

<p id="id04049"> Clau. And so she doth coosin</p><br>

<p id="id04050"> Beat. Good Lord for alliance: thus goes euery one
to the world but I, and I am sun-burn'd, I may sit in a corner
and cry, heigh ho for a husband</p><br>

<p id="id04051"> Pedro. Lady Beatrice, I will get you one</p><br>

<p id="id04052"> Beat. I would rather haue one of your fathers getting:
hath your Grace ne're a brother like you? your father
got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them</p><br>

<p id="id04053"> Prince. Will you haue me? Lady</p><br>

<p id="id04054"> Beat. No, my Lord, vnlesse I might haue another for
working-daies, your Grace is too costly to weare euerie
day: but I beseech your Grace pardon mee, I was borne
to speake all mirth, and no matter</p><br>

<p id="id04055"> Prince. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry,
best becomes you, for out of question, you were born
in a merry howre</p><br>

<p id="id04056"> Beatr. No sure my Lord, my Mother cried, but then
there was a starre daunst, and vnder that was I borne: cosins
God giue you ioy</p><br>

<p id="id04057">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. Neece, will you looke to those things I told<br>

you of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. I cry you mercy Vncle, by your Graces pardon.<br>

<p id="id04058">Exit Beatrice.</p><br>

<p id="id04059"> Prince. By my troth a pleasant spirited Lady</p><br>

<p id="id04060"> Leon. There's little of the melancholy element in her
my Lord, she is neuer sad, but when she sleepes, and not
euer sad then: for I haue heard my daughter say, she hath
often dreamt of vnhappinesse, and wakt her selfe with
laughing</p><br>

<p id="id04061"> Pedro. Shee cannot indure to heare tell of a husband</p><br>

out of suite</p><br>

<p id="id04063"> Prince. She were an excellent wife for Benedick</p><br>

<p id="id04064">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. O Lord, my Lord, if they were but a weeke<br>

married, they would talke themselues madde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04065">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Counte Claudio, when meane you to goe to<br>

Church?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. To morrow my Lord, Time goes on crutches,<br>

till Loue haue all his rites<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04066"> Leonato. Not till monday, my deare sonne, which is
hence a iust seuen night, and a time too briefe too, to haue
all things answer minde</p><br>

<p id="id04067"> Prince. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing,
but I warrant thee Claudio, the time shall not goe
dully by vs, I will in the interim, vndertake one of Hercules
labors, which is, to bring Signior Benedicke and the
Lady Beatrice into a mountaine of affection, th' one with
th' other, I would faine haue it a match, and I doubt not
but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance
as I shall giue you direction</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. I will doe any modest office, my Lord, to helpe<br>

my cosin to a good husband<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04071"> Prin. And Benedick is not the vnhopefullest husband
that I know: thus farre can I praise him, hee is of a noble
straine, of approued valour, and confirm'd honesty, I will
teach you how to humour your cosin, that shee shall fall
in loue with Benedicke, and I, with your two helpes, will
so practise on Benedicke, that in despight of his quicke
wit, and his queasie stomacke, hee shall fall in loue with
Beatrice: if wee can doe this, Cupid is no longer an Archer,
his glory shall be ours, for wee are the onely louegods,
goe in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

medicinable to me, I am sicke in displeasure to him, and
whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges euenly

dishonesty shall appeare in me</p><br>

<p id="id04076"> Iohn. Shew me breefely how</p><br>

<p id="id04077"> Bor. I thinke I told your Lordship a yeere since, how

to Hero</p><br>

<p id="id04078"> Iohn. I remember</p><br>

<p id="id04079" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bor. I can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,
appoint her to looke out at her Ladies chamber window</p><br>

<p id="id04080"> Iohn. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
 Bor. The poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe
you to the Prince your brother, spare not to tell him, that
hee hath wronged his Honor in marrying the renowned
Claudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold vp, to a
contaminated stale, such a one as Hero</p><br>

<p id="id04081">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. What proofe shall I make of that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Proofe enough, to misuse the Prince, to vexe<br>

Claudio, to vndoe Hero, and kill Leonato, looke you for any<br>

other issue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Onely to despight them, I will endeauour any<br>

Pedro and the Count Claudio alone, tell them that you

to the Prince and Claudio (as in a loue of your brothers
honor who hath made this match) and his friends reputation,
who is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance
of a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they will scarcely
beleeue this without triall: offer them instances which
shall beare no lesse likelihood, than to see mee at her
chamber window, heare me call Margaret, Hero; heare
Margaret terme me Claudio, and bring them to see this
the very night before the intended wedding, for in the
meane time, I will so fashion the matter, that Hero shall
be absent, and there shall appeare such seeming truths of
Heroes disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd assurance,
and all the preparation ouerthrowne</p><br>

<p id="id04083"> Iohn. Grow this to what aduerse issue it can, I will
put it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and

<p id="id04089">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. In my chamber window lies a booke, bring it<br>

hither to me in the orchard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04090">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. I am heere already sir.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04091"> Bene. I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and
heere againe. I doe much wonder, that one man seeing
how much another man is a foole, when he dedicates his
behauiours to loue, will after hee hath laught at such
shallow follies in others, become the argument of his
owne scorne, by falling in loue, &amp; such a man is Claudio.
I haue known when there was no musicke with him but
the drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the
taber and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue
walkt ten mile afoot, to see a good armor, and now will
he lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet:
he was wont to speake plaine, &amp; to the purpose (like
an honest man &amp; a souldier) and now is he turn'd orthography,
his words are a very fantasticall banquet, iust so
many strange dishes: may I be so conuerted, &amp; see with
these eyes? I cannot tell, I thinke not: I will not bee
sworne, but loue may transforme me to an oyster, but Ile
take my oath on it, till he haue made an oyster of me, he
shall neuer make me such a foole: one woman is faire, yet
I am well: another is wise, yet I am well: another vertuous,
yet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,
one woman shall not come in my grace: rich shee shall
be, that's certaine: wise, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile neuer
cheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,
or come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of
good discourse: an excellent Musitian, and her haire shal
be of what colour it please God, hah! the Prince and
Monsieur Loue, I will hide me in the Arbor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Yea my good Lord: how still the euening is.<br>

As husht on purpose to grace harmonie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04093">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. See you where Benedicke hath hid himselfe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. O very well my Lord: the musicke ended,<br>

Wee'll fit the kid-foxe with a penny worth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04094"> Prince. Come Balthasar, wee'll heare that song again</p><br>

To slander musicke any more then once<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04096">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. It is the witnesse still of excellency,<br>

To slander Musicke any more then once<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04097">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. It is the witnesse still of excellencie,<br>

To put a strange face on his owne perfection,<br>

I pray thee sing, and let me woe no more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04098">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balth. Because you talke of wooing, I will sing,<br>

Since many a wooer doth commence his suit,<br>

To her he thinkes not worthy, yet he wooes,<br>

Yet will he sweare he loues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04099">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Nay pray thee come,<br>

Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br>

Doe it in notes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04100">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balth. Note this before my notes,<br>

Theres not a note of mine that's worth the noting<br>

Note notes forsooth, and nothing<br>

<p id="id04102"> Bene. Now diuine aire, now is his soule rauisht, is it

<p id="id04108"> Ben. And he had been a dog that should haue howld

<p id="id04109"> Prince. Yea marry, dost thou heare Balthasar? I pray

<p id="id04111">Exit Balthasar.</p><br>

<p id="id04112"> Prince. Do so, farewell. Come hither Leonato, what
was it you told me of to day, that your Niece Beatrice
was in loue with signior Benedicke?
 Cla. O I, stalke on, stalke on, the foule sits. I did neuer
thinke that Lady would haue loued any man</p><br>

<p id="id04113"> Leon. No, nor I neither, but most wonderful, that she
should so dote on Signior Benedicke, whom shee hath in
all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre</p><br>

<p id="id04114">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Is't possible? sits the winde in that corner?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. By my troth my Lord, I cannot tell what to<br>

thinke of it, but that she loues him with an inraged affection,<br>

it is past the infinite of thought<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04115"> Prince. May be she doth but counterfeit</p><br>

<p id="id04116"> Claud. Faith like enough</p><br>

<p id="id04117"> Leon. O God! counterfeit? there was neuer counterfeit
of passion, came so neere the life of passion as she discouers
it</p><br>

<p id="id04118">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Why what effects of passion shewes she?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Baite the hooke well, this fish will bite<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04119">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. What effects my Lord? shee will sit you, you<br>

heard my daughter tell you how<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04120"> Clau. She did indeed</p><br>

<p id="id04121"> Prince. How, how I pray you? you amaze me, I would
haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all
assaults of affection</p><br>

<p id="id04122" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Leo. I would haue sworne it had, my Lord, especially
against Benedicke</p><br>

<p id="id04123"> Bene. I should thinke this a gull, but that the whitebearded
fellow speakes it: knauery cannot sure hide
himselfe in such reuerence</p><br>

<p id="id04124"> Claud. He hath tane th' infection, hold it vp</p><br>

<p id="id04125">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Hath shee made her affection known to Benedicke:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. No, and sweares she neuer will, that's her<br>

torment<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04126"> Claud. 'Tis true indeed, so your daughter saies: shall
I, saies she, that haue so oft encountred him with scorne,
write to him that I loue him?
 Leo. This saies shee now when shee is beginning to
write to him, for shee'll be vp twenty times a night, and
there will she sit in her smocke, till she haue writ a sheet
of paper: my daughter tells vs all</p><br>

<p id="id04127">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Now you talke of a sheet of paper, I remember<br>

a pretty iest your daughter told vs of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. O when she had writ it, &amp; was reading it ouer,<br>

she found Benedicke and Beatrice betweene the sheete<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04129"> Clau. That</p><br>

<p id="id04130"> Leon. O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,
raild at her self, that she should be so immodest to write,
to one that shee knew would flout her: I measure him,
saies she, by my owne spirit, for I should flout him if hee
writ to mee, yea though I loue him, I should</p><br>

<p id="id04131"> Clau. Then downe vpon her knees she falls, weepes,
sobs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, curses, O
sweet Benedicke, God giue me patience</p><br>

<p id="id04132"> Leon. She doth indeed, my daughter saies so, and the
extasie hath so much ouerborne her, that my daughter is
somtime afeard she will doe a desperate out-rage to her
selfe, it is very true</p><br>

<p id="id04133">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. It were good that Benedicke knew of it by some<br>

other, if she will not discouer it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04134">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. To what end? he would but make a sport of it,<br>

and torment the poore Lady worse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04135"> Prin. And he should, it were an almes to hang him,
shee's an excellent sweet Lady, and (out of all suspition,)
she is vertuous</p><br>

<p id="id04136"> Claudio. And she is exceeding wise</p><br>

<p id="id04137"> Prince. In euery thing, but in louing Benedicke</p><br>

<p id="id04138"> Leon. O my Lord, wisedome and bloud combating in
so tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud
hath the victory, I am sorry for her, as I haue iust cause,
being her Vncle, and her Guardian</p><br>

<p id="id04139"> Prince. I would shee had bestowed this dotage on
mee, I would haue daft all other respects, and made her
halfe my selfe: I pray you tell Benedicke of it, and heare
what he will say</p><br>

<p id="id04140"> Leon. Were it good thinke you?
 Clau. Hero thinkes surely she wil die, for she saies she
will die, if hee loue her not, and shee will die ere shee
make her loue knowne, and she will die if hee wooe her,
rather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed
crossenesse</p><br>

<p id="id04141"> Prince. She doth well, if she should make tender of her
loue, 'tis very possible hee'l scorne it, for the man (as you
know all) hath a contemptible spirit</p><br>

<p id="id04142"> Clau. He is a very proper man</p><br>

<p id="id04143"> Prin. He hath indeed a good outward happines</p><br>

<p id="id04144"> Clau. 'Fore God, and in my minde very wise</p><br>

<p id="id04145" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Prin. He doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like
wit</p><br>

<p id="id04146"> Leon. And I take him to be valiant</p><br>

<p id="id04147"> Prin. As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of
quarrels you may see hee is wise, for either hee auoydes
them with great discretion, or vndertakes them with a
Christian-like feare</p><br>

<p id="id04148"> Leon. If hee doe feare God, a must necessarilie keepe
peace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a
quarrell with feare and trembling</p><br>

<p id="id04149"> Prin. And so will he doe, for the man doth fear God,
howsoeuer it seemes not in him, by some large ieasts hee
will make: well, I am sorry for your niece, shall we goe
see Benedicke, and tell him of her loue</p><br>

<p id="id04150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Neuer tell him, my Lord, let her weare it out<br>

with good counsell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04151">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Nay that's impossible, she may weare her heart<br>

out first<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04152"> Prin. Well, we will heare further of it by your daughter,
let it coole the while, I loue Benedicke well, and I
could wish he would modestly examine himselfe, to see
how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a Lady</p><br>

<p id="id04153"> Leon. My Lord, will you walke? dinner is ready</p><br>

<p id="id04154" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clau. If he do not doat on her vpon this, I wil neuer
trust my expectation</p><br>

<p id="id04155"> Prin. Let there be the same Net spread for her, and
that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry:
the sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of anothers
dotage, and no such matter, that's the Scene that I
would see, which will be meerely a dumbe shew: let vs
send her to call him into dinner.</p><br>

<p id="id04156">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id04157"> Bene. This can be no tricke, the conference was sadly
borne, they haue the truth of this from Hero, they seeme
to pittie the Lady: it seemes her affections haue the full
bent: loue me? why it must be requited: I heare how I
am censur'd, they say I will beare my selfe proudly, if I
perceiue the loue come from her: they say too, that she
will rather die than giue any signe of affection: I did neuer
thinke to marry, I must not seeme proud, happy are
they that heare their detractions, and can put them to
mending: they say the Lady is faire, 'tis a truth, I can
beare them witnesse: and vertuous, tis so, I cannot reprooue
it, and wise, but for louing me, by my troth it is
no addition to her witte, nor no great argument of her
folly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may chance
haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken
on mee, because I haue rail'd so long against marriage:
but doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in
his youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips
and sentences, and these paper bullets of the braine awe
a man from the careere of his humour? No, the world
must be peopled. When I said I would die a batcheler, I
did not think I should liue till I were maried, here comes
Beatrice: by this day, shee's a faire Lady, I doe spie some
markes of loue in her.
Enter Beatrice.</p><br>

<p id="id04158" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Beat. Against my wil I am sent to bid you come in to
dinner</p><br>

<p id="id04159"> Bene. Faire Beatrice, I thanke you for your paines</p><br>

<p id="id04160"> Beat. I tooke no more paines for those thankes, then
you take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I
would not haue come</p><br>

<p id="id04161"> Bene. You take pleasure then in the message</p><br>

<p id="id04162"> Beat. Yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues
point, and choake a daw withall: you haue no stomacke
signior, fare you well.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id04163"> Bene. Ha, against my will I am sent to bid you come
into dinner: there's a double meaning in that: I tooke
no more paines for those thankes then you took paines
to thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that I
take for you is as easie as thankes: if I do not take pitty
of her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I
will goe get her picture.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id04164" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Tertius.</p><br>

<p id="id04165">Enter Hero and two Gentlemen, Margaret, and Vrsula.</p><br>

<p id="id04166">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Good Margaret runne thee to the parlour,<br>

There shalt thou finde my Cosin Beatrice,<br>

Proposing with the Prince and Claudio,<br>

Whisper her eare, and tell her I and Vrsula,<br>

Walke in the Orchard, and our whole discourse<br>

Is all of her, say that thou ouer-heardst vs,<br>

And bid her steale into the pleached bower,<br>

Where hony-suckles ripened by the sunne,<br>

Forbid the sunne to enter: like fauourites,<br>

Made proud by Princes, that aduance their pride,<br>

Against that power that bred it, there will she hide her,<br>

To listen our purpose, this is thy office,<br>

Beare thee well in it, and leaue vs alone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04167"> Marg. Ile make her come I warrant you presently</p><br>

<p id="id04168">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Now Vrsula, when Beatrice doth come,<br>

As we do trace this alley vp and downe,<br>

Our talke must onely be of Benedicke,<br>

When I doe name him, let it be thy part,<br>

To praise him more then euer man did merit,<br>

My talke to thee must be how Benedicke<br>

Is sicke in loue with Beatrice; of this matter,<br>

Is little Cupids crafty arrow made,<br>

That onely wounds by heare-say: now begin,<br>

Enter Beatrice.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04169">For looke where Beatrice like a Lapwing runs<br>

Close by the ground, to heare our conference<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04170">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrs. The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish<br>

Cut with her golden ores the siluer streame,<br>

And greedily deuoure the treacherous baite:<br>

So angle we for Beatrice, who euen now,<br>

Is couched in the wood-bine couerture,<br>

Feare you not my part of the Dialogue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing,<br>

Of the false sweete baite that we lay for it:<br>

No truely Vrsula, she is too disdainfull,<br>

I know her spirits are as coy and wilde,<br>

As Haggerds of the rocke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04172">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsula. But are you sure,<br>

That Benedicke loues Beatrice so intirely?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. So saies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04173">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrs. And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,<br>

But I perswaded them, if they lou'd Benedicke,<br>

To wish him wrastle with affection,<br>

And neuer to let Beatrice know of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04174">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsula. Why did you so, doth not the Gentleman<br>

Deserue as full as fortunate a bed,<br>

As euer Beatrice shall couch vpon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. O God of loue! I know he doth deserue,<br>

As much as may be yeelded to a man:<br>

But Nature neuer fram'd a womans heart,<br>

Of prowder stuffe then that of Beatrice:<br>

Disdaine and Scorne ride sparkling in her eyes,<br>

Mis-prizing what they looke on, and her wit<br>

Values it selfe so highly, that to her<br>

All matter else seemes weake: she cannot loue,<br>

Nor take no shape nor proiect of affection,<br>

Shee is so selfe indeared<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04175">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsula. Sure I thinke so,<br>

And therefore certainely it were not good<br>

She knew his loue, lest she make sport at it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04176">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Why you speake truth, I neuer yet saw man,<br>

How wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.<br>

But she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,<br>

She would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:<br>

If blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,<br>

Made a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:<br>

If low, an agot very vildlie cut:<br>

If speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:<br>

If silent, why a blocke moued with none.<br>

So turnes she euery man the wrong side out,<br>

And neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that<br>

Which simplenesse and merit purchaseth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04177"> Vrsu. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable</p><br>

<p id="id04178">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. No, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,<br>

As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable,<br>

But who dare tell her so? if I should speake,<br>

She would mocke me into ayre, O she would laugh me<br>

Out of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,<br>

Therefore let Benedicke like couered fire,<br>

Consume away in sighes, waste inwardly:<br>

It were a better death, to die with mockes,<br>

Which is as bad as die with tickling<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04179"> Vrsu. Yet tell her of it, heare what shee will say</p><br>

<p id="id04180">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. No, rather I will goe to Benedicke,<br>

And counsaile him to fight against his passion,<br>

And truly Ile deuise some honest slanders,<br>

To staine my cosin with, one doth not know,<br>

How much an ill word may impoison liking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04181">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsu. O doe not doe your cosin such a wrong,<br>

She cannot be so much without true iudgement,<br>

Hauing so swift and excellent a wit<br>

As she is prisde to haue, as to refuse<br>

So rare a Gentleman as signior Benedicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04182">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. He is the onely man of Italy,<br>

Alwaies excepted, my deare Claudio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04183">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsu. I pray you be not angry with me, Madame,<br>

Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedicke,<br>

For shape, for bearing argument and valour,<br>

Goes formost in report through Italy<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04184"> Hero. Indeed he hath an excellent good name</p><br>

<p id="id04185">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsu. His excellence did earne it ere he had it:<br>

When are you married Madame?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Why euerie day to morrow, come goe in,<br>

Ile shew thee some attires, and haue thy counsell,<br>

Which is the best to furnish me to morrow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04186">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vrsu. Shee's tane I warrant you,<br>

We haue caught her Madame?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. If it proue so, then louing goes by haps,<br>

Some Cupid kills with arrowes, some with traps.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04187">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. What fire is in mine eares? can this be true?<br>

Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorne so much?<br>

Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adew,<br>

No glory liues behinde the backe of such.<br>

And Benedicke, loue on, I will requite thee,<br>

Taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand:<br>

If thou dost loue, my kindnesse shall incite thee<br>

To binde our loues vp in a holy band.<br>

For others say thou dost deserue, and I<br>

Beleeue it better then reportingly.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04188">Enter Prince, Claudio, Benedicke, and Leonato.</p><br>

<p id="id04189">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. I doe but stay till your marriage be consummate,<br>

and then go I toward Arragon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04190">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Ile bring you thither my Lord, if you'l vouchsafe<br>

me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04191"> Prin. Nay, that would be as great a soyle in the new
glosse of your marriage, as to shew a childe his new coat
and forbid him to weare it, I will onely bee bold with
Benedicke for his companie, for from the crowne of his
head, to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth, he hath twice
or thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and the little hang-man
dare not shoot at him, he hath a heart as sound as a bell,
and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinkes,
his tongue speakes</p><br>

<p id="id04192"> Bene. Gallants, I am not as I haue bin</p><br>

<p id="id04193"> Leo. So say I, methinkes you are sadder</p><br>

<p id="id04194"> Claud. I hope he be in loue</p><br>

<p id="id04195"> Prin. Hang him truant, there's no true drop of bloud
in him to be truly toucht with loue, if he be sad, he wants
money</p><br>

<p id="id04196"> Bene. I haue the tooth-ach</p><br>

<p id="id04197"> Prin. Draw it</p><br>

<p id="id04198"> Bene. Hang it</p><br>

<p id="id04199"> Claud. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards</p><br>

<p id="id04200"> Prin. What? sigh for the tooth-ach</p><br>

<p id="id04201"> Leon. Where is but a humour or a worme</p><br>

<p id="id04202" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bene. Well, euery one cannot master a griefe, but hee
that has it</p><br>

<p id="id04203"> Clau. Yet say I, he is in loue</p><br>

<p id="id04204"> Prin. There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnlesse
it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to bee a
Dutchman to day, a Frenchman to morrow: vnlesse hee
haue a fancy to this foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee
is no foole for fancy, as you would haue it to appeare
he is</p><br>

<p id="id04205"> Clau. If he be not in loue with some woman, there
is no beleeuing old signes, a brushes his hat a mornings,
What should that bode?
 Prin. Hath any man seene him at the Barbers?
 Clau. No, but the Barbers man hath beene seen with
him, and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie
stuft tennis balls</p><br>

<p id="id04206">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Indeed he lookes yonger than hee did, by the<br>

losse of a beard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04207">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Nay a rubs himselfe with Ciuit, can you smell<br>

him out by that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in<br>

loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04208"> Prin. The greatest note of it is his melancholy</p><br>

<p id="id04209">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. And when was he wont to wash his face?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Yea, or to paint himselfe? for the which I heare<br>

what they say of him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04210">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Nay, but his iesting spirit, which is now crept<br>

into a lute-string, and now gouern'd by stops<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04211">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Indeed that tels a heauy tale for him: conclude,<br>

he is in loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04212"> Clau. Nay, but I know who loues him</p><br>

<p id="id04213">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. That would I know too, I warrant one that<br>

knowes him not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04214">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Yes, and his ill conditions, and in despight of all,<br>

dies for him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04215"> Prin. Shee shall be buried with her face vpwards</p><br>

<p id="id04216"> Bene. Yet is this no charme for the tooth-ake, old signior,
walke aside with mee, I haue studied eight or nine
wise words to speake to you, which these hobby-horses
must not heare</p><br>

<p id="id04217"> Prin. For my life to breake with him about Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04218"> Clau. 'Tis euen so, Hero and Margaret haue by this
played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two Beares
will not bite one another when they meete.
Enter Iohn the Bastard.</p><br>

<p id="id04219"> Bast. My Lord and brother, God saue you</p><br>

<p id="id04220"> Prin. Good den brother</p><br>

<p id="id04221"> Bast. If your leisure seru'd, I would speake with you</p><br>

<p id="id04222">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. In priuate?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. If it please you, yet Count Claudio may heare,<br>

for what I would speake of, concernes him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04223">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. What's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Basta. Meanes your Lordship to be married to morrow?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. You know he does<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04224"> Bast. I know not that when he knowes what I know</p><br>

<p id="id04225" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clau. If there be any impediment, I pray you discouer
it</p><br>

<p id="id04226"> Bast. You may thinke I loue you not, let that appeare
hereafter, and ayme better at me by that I now will manifest,
for my brother (I thinke, he holds you well, and in
dearenesse of heart) hath holpe to effect your ensuing
marriage: surely sute ill spent, and labour ill bestowed</p><br>

<p id="id04227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Why, what's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bastard. I came hither to tell you, and circumstances<br>

shortned, (for she hath beene too long a talking of) the<br>

Lady is disloyall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04228">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Who Hero?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Euen shee, Leonatoes Hero, your Hero, euery<br>

mans Hero<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04229"> Clau. Disloyall?
 Bast. The word is too good to paint out her wickednesse,
I could say she were worse, thinke you of a worse
title, and I will fit her to it: wonder not till further warrant:
goe but with mee to night, you shal see her chamber
window entred, euen the night before her wedding
day, if you loue her, then to morrow wed her: But it
would better fit your honour to change your minde</p><br>

<p id="id04230">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. May this be so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Princ. I will not thinke it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04231"> Bast. If you dare not trust that you see, confesse not
that you know: if you will follow mee, I will shew you
enough, and when you haue seene more, &amp; heard more,
proceed accordingly</p><br>

<p id="id04232"> Clau. If I see any thing to night, why I should not
marry her to morrow in the congregation, where I shold
wedde, there will I shame her</p><br>

<p id="id04233" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Prin. And as I wooed for thee to obtaine her, I will
ioyne with thee to disgrace her</p><br>

<p id="id04234"> Bast. I will disparage her no farther, till you are my
witnesses, beare it coldly but till night, and let the issue
shew it selfe</p><br>

<p id="id04235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. O day vntowardly turned!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. O mischiefe strangelie thwarting!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bastard. O plague right well preuented! so will you<br>

say, when you haue seene the sequele.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04236">Enter Dogbery and his compartner with the watch.</p><br>

<p id="id04237">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog. Are you good men and true?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Verg. Yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer<br>

saluation body and soule<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04238"> Dogb. Nay, that were a punishment too good for
them, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being
chosen for the Princes watch</p><br>

<p id="id04239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verges. Well, giue them their charge, neighbour<br>

Dogbery<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04240">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog. First, who thinke you the most desartlesse man<br>

to be Constable<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch.1. Hugh Ote-cake sir, or George Sea-coale, for<br>

they can write and reade<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04242"> Dogb. Come hither neighbour Sea-coale, God hath
blest you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,
is the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes by
Nature</p><br>

<p id="id04243"> Watch 2. Both which Master Constable
 Dogb. You haue: I knew it would be your answere:
well, for your fauour sir, why giue God thankes, &amp; make
no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that
appeare when there is no need of such vanity, you are
thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the
Constable of the watch: therefore beare you the lanthorne:
this is your charge: You shall comprehend all
vagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the Princes
name</p><br>

<p id="id04244">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch 2. How if a will not stand?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogb. Why then take no note of him, but let him go,<br>

and presently call the rest of the Watch together, and<br>

thanke God you are ridde of a knaue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verges. If he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is<br>

none of the Princes subiects<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04246"> Dogb. True, and they are to meddle with none but
the Princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the
streetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is most
tollerable, and not to be indured</p><br>

<p id="id04247" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Watch. We will rather sleepe than talke, wee know
what belongs to a Watch</p><br>

<p id="id04248"> Dog. Why you speake like an ancient and most quiet
watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:
only haue a care that your bills be not stolne: well, you
are to call at all the Alehouses, and bid them that are
drunke get them to bed</p><br>

<p id="id04249">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch. How if they will not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogb. Why then let them alone till they are sober, if<br>

they make you not then the better answere, you may say,<br>

they are not the men you tooke them for<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04250"> Watch. Well sir,
 Dogb. If you meet a theefe, you may suspect him, by
vertue of your office, to be no true man: and for such
kinde of men, the lesse you meddle or make with them,
why the more is for your honesty</p><br>

<p id="id04251" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Watch. If wee know him to be a thiefe, shall wee not
lay hands on him</p><br>

<p id="id04252"> Dogb. Truly by your office you may, but I think they
that touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable way
for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him shew himselfe
what he is, and steale out of your company</p><br>

<p id="id04253"> Ver. You haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful ma[n] partner</p><br>

<p id="id04254">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog. Truely I would not hang a dog by my will, much<br>

more a man who hath anie honestie in him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04255">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verges. If you heare a child crie in the night you must<br>

call to the nurse, and bid her still it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04256"> Watch. How if the nurse be asleepe and will not
heare vs?
 Dog. Why then depart in peace, and let the childe
wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare
her Lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when
he bleates</p><br>

<p id="id04257"> Verges. 'Tis verie true</p><br>

<p id="id04258"> Dog. This is the end of the charge: you constable
are to present the Princes owne person, if you meete the
Prince in the night, you may staie him</p><br>

<p id="id04259"> Verges. Nay birladie that I thinke a cannot</p><br>

<p id="id04260"> Dog. Fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that
knowes the Statutes, he may staie him, marrie not without
the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to
offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against
his will</p><br>

<p id="id04261"> Verges. Birladie I thinke it be so</p><br>

<p id="id04262"> Dog. Ha, ah ha, well masters good night, and there be
anie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe your
fellowes counsailes, and your owne, and good night,
come neighbour</p><br>

<p id="id04263"> Watch. Well masters, we heare our charge, let vs go
sit here vpon the Church bench till two, and then all to
bed</p><br>

<p id="id04264"> Dog. One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you
watch about signior Leonatoes doore, for the wedding being
there to morrow, there is a great coyle to night,
adiew, be vigitant I beseech you.</p><br>

<p id="id04265">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id04266">Enter Borachio and Conrade.</p><br>

<p id="id04267">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. What, Conrade?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch. Peace, stir not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04268"> Bor. Conrade I say</p><br>

<p id="id04269"> Con. Here man, I am at thy elbow</p><br>

<p id="id04270">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Mas and my elbow itcht, I thought there would<br>

a scabbe follow<br>

<p id="id04271">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. I will owe thee an answere for that, and now<br>

forward with thy tale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04272"> Bor. Stand thee close then vnder this penthouse, for it
drissels raine, and I will, like a true drunkard, vtter all to
thee</p><br>

<p id="id04273"> Watch. Some treason masters, yet stand close</p><br>

<p id="id04274" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bor. Therefore know, I haue earned of Don Iohn a
thousand Ducates</p><br>

<p id="id04275"> Con. Is it possible that anie villanie should be so deare?
 Bor. Thou should'st rather aske if it were possible anie
villanie should be so rich? for when rich villains haue
neede of poore ones, poore ones may make what price
they will</p><br>

<p id="id04276"> Con. I wonder at it</p><br>

<p id="id04277"> Bor. That shewes thou art vnconfirm'd, thou knowest
that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloake, is nothing
to a man</p><br>

<p id="id04278"> Con. Yes, it is apparell</p><br>

<p id="id04279"> Bor. I meane the fashion</p><br>

<p id="id04280"> Con. Yes the fashion is the fashion</p><br>

<p id="id04281"> Bor. Tush, I may as well say the foole's the foole, but
seest thou not what a deformed theefe this fashion is?
 Watch. I know that deformed, a has bin a vile theefe,
this vii. yeares, a goes vp and downe like a gentle man:
I remember his name</p><br>

<p id="id04282">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Did'st thou not heare some bodie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. No, 'twas the vaine on the house<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04283"> Bor. Seest thou not (I say) what a deformed thiefe
this fashion is, how giddily a turnes about all the Hotblouds,
betweene, foureteene &amp; fiue &amp; thirtie, sometimes
fashioning them like Pharaoes souldiours in the rechie
painting, sometime like god Bels priests in the old
Church window, sometime like the shauen Hercules in
the smircht worm-eaten tapestrie, where his cod-peece
seemes as massie as his club</p><br>

<p id="id04284"> Con. All this I see, and see that the fashion weares out
more apparrell then the man; but art not thou thy selfe
giddie with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of
thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
 Bor. Not so neither, but know that I haue to night
wooed Margaret the Lady Heroes gentle-woman, by the
name of Hero, she leanes me out at her mistris chamberwindow,
bids me a thousand times good night: I tell
this tale vildly. I should first tell thee how the Prince
Claudio and my Master planted, and placed, and possessed
by my Master Don Iohn, saw a far off in the Orchard this
amiable incounter</p><br>

<p id="id04285"> Con. And thought thy Margaret was Hero?
 Bor. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the
diuell my Master knew she was Margaret and partly by
his oathes, which first possest them, partly by the darke
night which did deceiue them, but chiefely, by my villanie,
which did confirme any slander that Don Iohn had
made, away went Claudio enraged, swore hee would
meete her as he was apointed next morning at the Temple,
and there, before the whole congregation shame her
with what he saw o're night, and send her home againe
without a husband</p><br>

<p id="id04286"> Watch.1. We charge you in the Princes name stand</p><br>

doe not wrest true speaking, Ile offend no body, is
there any harme in the heauier for a husband? none I

that I thinke you are in loue, nay birlady I am not
such a foole to thinke what I list, nor I list not to thinke
what I can, nor indeed, I cannot thinke, if I would thinke
my hart out of thinking, that you are in loue, or that you
will be in loue, or that you can be in loue: yet Benedicke
was such another, and now is he become a man, he swore
hee would neuer marry, and yet now in despight of his
heart he eates his meat without grudging, and how you
may be conuerted I know not, but me thinkes you looke
with your eies as other women doe</p><br>

men daily do!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. How now! interiections? why then, some be<br>

May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?<br>

There Leonato, take her backe againe,<br>

Giue not this rotten Orenge to your friend,<br>

Shee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:<br>

Behold how like a maid she blushes heere!<br>

O what authoritie and shew of truth<br>

Can cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!<br>

Comes not that bloud, as modest euidence,<br>

To witnesse simple Vertue? would you not sweare<br>

All you that see her, that she were a maide,<br>

By these exterior shewes? But she is none:<br>

She knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:<br>

Her blush is guiltinesse, not modestie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04373">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. What doe you meane, my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Not to be married,<br>

Not to knit my soule to an approued wanton<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04374">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Deere my Lord, if you in your owne proofe,<br>

Haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,<br>

And made defeat of her virginitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04375">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. I know what you would say: if I haue knowne<br>

(her,<br>

You will say, she did imbrace me as a husband,<br>

And so extenuate the forehand sinne: No Leonato,<br>

I neuer tempted her with word too large,<br>

But as a brother to his sister, shewed<br>

Bashfull sinceritie and comely loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04376">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. And seem'd I euer otherwise to you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Out on thee seeming, I will write against it,<br>

You seeme to me as Diane in her Orbe,<br>

As chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne:<br>

But you are more intemperate in your blood,<br>

Than Venus, or those pampred animalls,<br>

That rage in sauage sensualitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04377">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Is my Lord well, that he doth speake so wide?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Sweete Prince, why speake not you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. What should I speake?<br>

I stand dishonour'd that haue gone about,<br>

To linke my deare friend to a common stale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04378">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Are these things spoken, or doe I but dreame?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04379"> Bene. This lookes not like a nuptiall</p><br>

<p id="id04380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. True, O God!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Leonato, stand I here?<br>

Is this the Prince? is this the Princes brother?<br>

Is this face Heroes? are our eies our owne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. All this is so, but what of this my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Let me but moue one question to your daughter,<br>

And by that fatherly and kindly power,<br>

That you haue in her, bid her answer truly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04381"> Leo. I charge thee doe, as thou art my childe</p><br>

<p id="id04382">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. O God defend me how am I beset,<br>

What kinde of catechizing call you this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. To make you answer truly to your name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04383">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Is it not Hero? who can blot that name<br>

With any iust reproach?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. Marry that can Hero,<br>

Hero it selfe can blot out Heroes vertue.<br>

What man was he, talkt with you yesternight,<br>

Out at your window betwixt twelue and one?<br>

Now if you are a maid, answer to this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04384"> Hero. I talkt with no man at that howre my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id04385">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Why then you are no maiden. Leonato,<br>

I am sorry you must heare: vpon mine honor,<br>

My selfe, my brother, and this grieued Count<br>

Did see her, heare her, at that howre last night,<br>

Talke with a ruffian at her chamber window,<br>

Who hath indeed most like a liberall villaine,<br>

Confest the vile encounters they haue had<br>

A thousand times in secret<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04386">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Fie, fie, they are not to be named my Lord,<br>

Not to be spoken of,<br>

There is not chastitie enough in language,<br>

Without offence to vtter them: thus pretty Lady<br>

I am sorry for thy much misgouernment<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04387">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claud. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou beene<br>

If halfe thy outward graces had beene placed<br>

About thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart?<br>

But fare thee well, most foule, most faire, farewell<br>

Thou pure impiety, and impious puritie,<br>

For thee Ile locke vp all the gates of Loue,<br>

And on my eie-lids shall Coniecture hang,<br>

To turne all beauty into thoughts of harme,<br>

And neuer shall it more be gracious<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04388">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Hath no mans dagger here a point for me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Why how now cosin, wherfore sink you down?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Come, let vs go: these things come thus to light,<br>

Smother her spirits vp<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04389">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. How doth the Lady?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Dead I thinke, helpe vncle,<br>

Hero, why Hero, Vncle, Signor Benedicke, Frier<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04390">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonato. O Fate! take not away thy heauy hand,<br>

Death is the fairest couer for her shame<br>

That may be wisht for<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04391">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatr. How now cosin Hero?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. Haue comfort Ladie<br>

<p id="id04392">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Dost thou looke vp?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Frier. Yea, wherefore should she not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Wherfore? Why doth not euery earthly thing<br>

Cry shame vpon her? Could she heere denie<br>

The storie that is printed in her blood?<br>

Do not liue Hero, do not ope thine eyes:<br>

For did I thinke thou wouldst not quickly die,<br>

Thought I thy spirits were stronger then thy shames,<br>

My selfe would on the reward of reproaches<br>

Strike at thy life. Grieu'd I, I had but one?<br>

Chid I, for that at frugal Natures frame?<br>

O one too much by thee: why had I one?<br>

Why euer was't thou louelie in my eies?<br>

Why had I not with charitable hand<br>

Tooke vp a beggars issue at my gates,<br>

Who smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie,<br>

I might haue said, no part of it is mine:<br>

This shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,<br>

But mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd,<br>

And mine that I was proud on mine so much,<br>

That I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:<br>

Valewing of her, why she, O she is falne<br>

Into a pit of Inke, that the wide sea<br>

Hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe,<br>

And salt too little, which may season giue<br>

To her foule tainted flesh<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04393">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Sir, sir, be patient: for my part, I am so attired<br>

in wonder, I know not what to say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04394"> Bea. O on my soule my cosin is belied</p><br>

<p id="id04395">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Ladie, were you her bedfellow last night?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bea. No, truly: not although vntill last night,<br>

I haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04396">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Confirm'd, confirm'd, O that is stronger made<br>

Which was before barr'd vp with ribs of iron.<br>

Would the Princes lie, and Claudio lie,<br>

Who lou'd her so, that speaking of her foulnesse,<br>

Wash'd it with teares? Hence from her, let her die<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04397">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. Heare me a little, for I haue onely bene silent so<br>

long, and giuen way vnto this course of fortune, by noting<br>

of the Ladie, I haue markt.<br>

A thousand blushing apparitions,<br>

To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames,<br>

In Angel whitenesse beare away those blushes,<br>

And in her eie there hath appear'd a fire<br>

To burne the errors that these Princes hold<br>

Against her maiden truth. Call me a foole,<br>

Trust not my reading, nor my obseruations,<br>

Which with experimental seale doth warrant<br>

The tenure of my booke: trust not my age,<br>

My reuerence, calling, nor diuinitie,<br>

If this sweet Ladie lye not guiltlesse heere,<br>

Vnder some biting error<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04398">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Friar, it cannot be:<br>

Thou seest that all the Grace that she hath left,<br>

Is, that she wil not adde to her damnation,<br>

A sinne of periury, she not denies it:<br>

Why seek'st thou then to couer with excuse,<br>

That which appeares in proper nakednesse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. Ladie, what man is he you are accus'd of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. They know that do accuse me, I know none:<br>

If I know more of any man aliue<br>

Then that which maiden modestie doth warrant,<br>

Let all my sinnes lacke mercy. O my Father,<br>

Proue you that any man with me conuerst,<br>

At houres vnmeete, or that I yesternight<br>

Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,<br>

Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04399"> Fri. There is some strange misprision in the Princes</p><br>

<p id="id04400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Two of them haue the verie bent of honor,<br>

And if their wisedomes be misled in this:<br>

The practise of it liues in Iohn the bastard,<br>

Whose spirits toile in frame of villanies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04401">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. I know not: if they speake but truth of her,<br>

These hands shall teare her: If they wrong her honour,<br>

The proudest of them shall wel heare of it.<br>

Time hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine,<br>

Nor age so eate vp my inuention,<br>

Nor Fortune made such hauocke of my meanes,<br>

Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br>

But they shall finde, awak'd in such a kinde,<br>

Both strength of limbe, and policie of minde,<br>

Ability in meanes, and choise of friends,<br>

To quit me of them throughly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04402">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. Pause awhile:<br>

And let my counsell sway you in this case,<br>

Your daughter heere the Princesse (left for dead)<br>

Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br>

And publish it, that she is dead indeed:<br>

Maintaine a mourning ostentation,<br>

And on your Families old monument,<br>

Hang mournfull Epitaphes, and do all rites,<br>

That appertaine vnto a buriall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04403">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. What shall become of this? What wil this do?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri. Marry this wel carried, shall on her behalfe,<br>

Change slander to remorse, that is some good,<br>

But not for that dreame I on this strange course,<br>

But on this trauaile looke for greater birth:<br>

She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,<br>

Vpon the instant that she was accus'd,<br>

Shal be lamented, pittied, and excus'd<br>

Of euery hearer: for it so fals out,<br>

That what we haue, we prize not to the worth,<br>

Whiles we enioy it; but being lack'd and lost,<br>

Why then we racke the value, then we finde<br>

The vertue that possession would not shew vs<br>

Whiles it was ours, so will it fare with Claudio:<br>

When he shal heare she dyed vpon his words,<br>

Th' Idea of her life shal sweetly creepe<br>

Into his study of imagination.<br>

And euery louely Organ of her life,<br>

Shall come apparel'd in more precious habite:<br>

More mouing delicate, and ful of life,<br>

Into the eye and prospect of his soule<br>

Then when she liu'd indeed: then shal he mourne,<br>

If euer Loue had interest in his Liuer,<br>

And wish he had not so accused her:<br>

No, though he thought his accusation true:<br>

Let this be so, and doubt not but successe<br>

Wil fashion the euent in better shape,<br>

Then I can lay it downe in likelihood.<br>

But if all ayme but this be leuelld false,<br>

The supposition of the Ladies death,<br>

Will quench the wonder of her infamie.<br>

And if it sort not well, you may conceale her<br>

As best befits her wounded reputation,<br>

In some reclusiue and religious life,<br>

Out of all eyes, tongues, mindes and iniuries<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04404">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Signior Leonato, let the Frier aduise you,<br>

And though you know my inwardnesse and loue<br>

Is very much vnto the Prince and Claudio.<br>

Yet, by mine honor, I will deale in this,<br>

As secretly and iustlie, as your soule<br>

Should with your bodie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04405">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Being that I flow in greefe,<br>

The smallest twine may lead me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04406">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frier. 'Tis well consented, presently away,<br>

For to strange sores, strangely they straine the cure,<br>

Come Lady, die to liue, this wedding day<br>

Perhaps is but prolong'd, haue patience &amp; endure.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04407">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Lady Beatrice, haue you wept all this while?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Yea, and I will weepe a while longer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04408"> Bene. I will not desire that</p><br>

<p id="id04409"> Beat. You haue no reason, I doe it freely</p><br>

<p id="id04410"> Bene. Surelie I do beleeue your fair cosin is wrong'd</p><br>

<p id="id04411">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Ah, how much might the man deserue of mee<br>

that would right her!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Is there any way to shew such friendship?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. A verie euen way, but no such friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04412">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. May a man doe it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. It is a mans office, but not yours<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04413"> Bene. I doe loue nothing in the world so well as you,
is not that strange?
 Beat. As strange as the thing I know not, it were as
possible for me to say, I loued nothing so well as you, but
beleeue me not, and yet I lie not, I confesse nothing, nor
I deny nothing, I am sorry for my cousin</p><br>

<p id="id04414"> Bene. By my sword Beatrice thou lou'st me</p><br>

<p id="id04415"> Beat. Doe not sweare by it and eat it</p><br>

<p id="id04416">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. I will sweare by it that you loue mee, and I will<br>

make him eat it that sayes I loue not you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04417">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Will you not eat your word?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. With no sawce that can be deuised to it, I protest<br>

I loue thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04418"> Beat. Why then God forgiue me</p><br>

<p id="id04419">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. What offence sweet Beatrice?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. You haue stayed me in a happy howre, I was about<br>

to protest I loued you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04420"> Bene. And doe it with all thy heart</p><br>

<p id="id04421" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. I loue you with so much of my heart, that none
is left to protest</p><br>

<p id="id04422"> Bened. Come, bid me doe any thing for thee</p><br>

<p id="id04423"> Beat. Kill Claudio</p><br>

<p id="id04424"> Bene. Ha, not for the wide world</p><br>

<p id="id04425"> Beat. You kill me to denie, farewell</p><br>

<p id="id04426"> Bene. Tarrie sweet Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04427" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. I am gone, though I am heere, there is no loue
in you, nay I pray you let me goe</p><br>

<p id="id04428"> Bene. Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04429"> Beat. Infaith I will goe</p><br>

<p id="id04430"> Bene. Wee'll be friends first</p><br>

<p id="id04431" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. You dare easier be friends with mee, than fight
with mine enemy</p><br>

<p id="id04432"> Bene. Is Claudio thine enemie?
 Beat. Is a not approued in the height a villaine, that
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
that I were a man! what, beare her in hand vntill they
come to take hands, and then with publike accusation
vncouered slander, vnmittigated rancour? O God that I
were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place</p><br>

<p id="id04433"> Bene. Heare me Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04434" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. Talke with a man out at a window, a proper
saying</p><br>

<p id="id04435"> Bene. Nay but Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04436" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Beat. Sweet Hero, she is wrong'd, shee is slandered,
she is vndone</p><br>

<p id="id04437"> Bene. Beat?
 Beat. Princes and Counties! surelie a Princely testimonie,
a goodly Count, Comfect, a sweet Gallant surelie,
O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any
friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted
into cursies, valour into complement, and men are
onelie turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now
as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and sweares it:
I cannot be a man with wishing, therfore I will die a woman
with grieuing</p><br>

<p id="id04438"> Bene. Tarry good Beatrice, by this hand I loue thee</p><br>

<p id="id04439">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Vse it for my loue some other way then swearing<br>

by it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04440">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bened. Thinke you in your soule the Count Claudio<br>

hath wrong'd Hero?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Yea, as sure as I haue a thought, or a soule<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04441"> Bene. Enough, I am engagde, I will challenge him, I
will kisse your hand, and so leaue you: by this hand Claudio
shall render me a deere account: as you heare of me,
so thinke of me: goe comfort your coosin, I must say she
is dead, and so farewell.

words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch. This is all<br>

I will goe before, and shew him their examination</p><br>

which is more, an officer, and which is more, a houshoulder,
and which is more, as pretty a peece of flesh as any in
Messina, and one that knowes the Law, goe to, &amp; a rich

And 'tis not wisedome thus to second griefe,<br>

Against your selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04473">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. I pray thee cease thy counsaile,<br>

Which falls into mine eares as profitlesse,<br>

As water in a siue: giue not me counsaile,<br>

Nor let no comfort delight mine eare,<br>

But such a one whose wrongs doth sute with mine.<br>

Bring me a father that so lou'd his childe,<br>

Whose ioy of her is ouer-whelmed like mine,<br>

And bid him speake of patience,<br>

Measure his woe the length and bredth of mine,<br>

And let it answere euery straine for straine,<br>

As thus for thus, and such a griefe for such,<br>

In euery lineament, branch, shape, and forme:<br>

If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,<br>

And sorrow, wagge, crie hem, when he should grone,<br>

Patch griefe with prouerbs, make misfortune drunke,<br>

With candle-wasters: bring him yet to me,<br>

And I of him will gather patience:<br>

But there is no such man, for brother, men<br>

Can counsaile, and speake comfort to that griefe,<br>

Which they themselues not feele, but tasting it,<br>

Their counsaile turnes to passion, which before,<br>

Would giue preceptiall medicine to rage,<br>

Fetter strong madnesse in a silken thred,<br>

Charme ache with ayre, and agony with words,<br>

No, no, 'tis all mens office, to speake patience<br>

To those that wring vnder the load of sorrow:<br>

But no mans vertue nor sufficiencie<br>

To be so morall, when he shall endure<br>

The like himselfe: therefore giue me no counsaile,<br>

How euer they haue writ the stile of gods,<br>

Thou hast so wrong'd my innocent childe and me,<br>

That I am forc'd to lay my reuerence by,<br>

And with grey haires and bruise of many daies,<br>

Doe challenge thee to triall of a man,<br>

Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,<br>

Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boyes,<br>

<p id="id04511">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. In a false quarrell there is no true valour, I came<br>

to seeke you both<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04512">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke thee, for<br>

we are high proofe melancholly, and would faine haue it<br>

beaten away, wilt thou vse thy wit?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. It is in my scabberd, shall I draw it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Doest thou weare thy wit by thy side?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Neuer any did so, though verie many haue been<br>

beside their wit, I will bid thee drawe, as we do the minstrels,<br>

draw to pleasure vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04513">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. As I am an honest man he lookes pale, art thou<br>

sicke, or angrie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. What, courage man: what though care kil'd a<br>

cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04514">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Sir, I shall meete your wit in the careere, and<br>

you charge it against me, I pray you chuse another subiect<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04515">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Nay then giue him another staffe, this last was<br>

broke crosse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04516">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. By this light, he changes more and more, I thinke<br>

he be angrie indeede<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04517"> Clau. If he be, he knowes how to turne his girdle</p><br>

<p id="id04518">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Shall I speake a word in your eare?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. God blesse me from a challenge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04519"> Ben. You are a villaine, I iest not, I will make it good
how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare:
do me right, or I will protest your cowardise: you haue
kill'd a sweete Ladie, and her death shall fall heauie on
you, let me heare from you</p><br>

<p id="id04520">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Well, I will meete you, so I may haue good<br>

cheare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04521">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. What, a feast, a feast?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. I faith I thanke him, he hath bid me to a calues<br>

head and a Capon, the which if I doe not carue most curiously,<br>

say my knife's naught, shall I not finde a woodcocke<br>

too?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04522"> Prin. Ile tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other
day: I said thou hadst a fine wit: true saies she, a fine
little one: no said I, a great wit: right saies shee, a great
grosse one: nay said I, a good wit: iust said she, it hurts
no body: nay said I, the gentleman is wise: certaine said
she, a wise gentleman: nay said I, he hath the tongues:
that I beleeue said shee, for hee swore a thing to me on
munday night, which he forswore on tuesday morning:
there's a double tongue, there's two tongues: thus did
shee an howre together trans-shape thy particular vertues,
yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the
proprest man in Italie</p><br>

<p id="id04523" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Claud. For the which she wept heartily, and said shee
car'd not</p><br>

<p id="id04524"> Prin. Yea that she did, but yet for all that, and if shee
did not hate him deadlie, shee would loue him dearely,
the old mans daughter told vs all</p><br>

<p id="id04525">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. All, all, and moreouer, God saw him when he<br>

was hid in the garden<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04526">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. But when shall we set the sauage Bulls hornes<br>

on the sensible Benedicks head?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Yea and text vnderneath, heere dwells Benedicke<br>

the married man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04527"> Ben. Fare you well, Boy, you know my minde, I will
leaue you now to your gossep-like humor, you breake
iests as braggards do their blades, which God be thanked
hurt not: my Lord, for your manie courtesies I thank
you, I must discontinue your companie, your brother
the Bastard is fled from Messina: you haue among you,
kill'd a sweet and innocent Ladie: for my Lord Lackebeard
there, he and I shall meete, and till then peace be
with him</p><br>

<p id="id04528"> Prin. He is in earnest</p><br>

<p id="id04529" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clau. In most profound earnest, and Ile warrant you,
for the loue of Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04530"> Prin. And hath challeng'd thee</p><br>

<p id="id04531"> Clau. Most sincerely</p><br>

<p id="id04532"> Prin. What a prettie thing man is, when he goes in his
doublet and hose, and leaues off his wit.
Enter Constable, Conrade, and Borachio.</p><br>

<p id="id04533" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Clau. He is then a Giant to an Ape, but then is an Ape
a Doctor to such a man</p><br>

<p id="id04534"> Prin. But soft you, let me be, plucke vp my heart, and
be sad, did he not say my brother was fled?
 Const. Come you sir, if iustice cannot tame you, shee
shall nere weigh more reasons in her ballance, nay, and
you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be lookt to</p><br>

<p id="id04535" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Prin. How now, two of my brothers men bound? Borachio
one</p><br>

<p id="id04536"> Clau. Harken after their offence my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id04537"> Prin. Officers, what offence haue these men done?
 Const. Marrie sir, they haue committed false report,
moreouer they haue spoken vntruths, secondarily they
are slanders, sixt and lastly, they haue belyed a Ladie,
thirdly, they haue verified vniust things, and to conclude
they are lying knaues</p><br>

<p id="id04538"> Prin. First I aske thee what they haue done, thirdlie
I aske thee what's their offence, sixt and lastlie why they
are committed, and to conclude, what you lay to their
charge</p><br>

<p id="id04539" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clau. Rightlie reasoned, and in his owne diuision, and
by my troth there's one meaning well suted</p><br>

<p id="id04540"> Prin. Who haue you offended masters, that you are
thus bound to your answer? this learned Constable is too
cunning to be vnderstood, what's your offence?
 Bor. Sweete Prince, let me go no farther to mine answere:
do you heare me, and let this Count kill mee: I
haue deceiued euen your verie eies: what your wisedomes
could not discouer, these shallow fooles haue
brought to light, who in the night ouerheard me confessing
to this man, how Don Iohn your brother incensed
me to slander the Ladie Hero, how you were brought
into the Orchard, and saw me court Margaret in Heroes
garments, how you disgrac'd her when you should
marrie her: my villanie they haue vpon record, which
I had rather seale with my death, then repeate ouer to
my shame: the Ladie is dead vpon mine and my masters
false accusation: and briefelie, I desire nothing but the
reward of a villaine</p><br>

<p id="id04541">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Runs not this speech like yron through your<br>

bloud?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. I haue drunke poison whiles he vtter'd it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04542">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. But did my Brother set thee on to this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04543">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. He is compos'd and fram'd of treacherie,<br>

And fled he is vpon this villanie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04544">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appeare<br>

In the rare semblance that I lou'd it first<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04545"> Const. Come, bring away the plaintiffes, by this time
our Sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
and masters, do not forget to specifie when time &amp; place
shall serue, that I am an Asse</p><br>

<p id="id04546">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Con.2. Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and<br>

the Sexton too.<br>

Enter Leonato.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04547">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Which is the villaine? let me see his eies,<br>

That when I note another man like him,<br>

I may auoide him: which of these is he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. If you would know your wronger, looke on me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04548">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. Art thou the slaue that with thy breath<br>

hast kild mine innocent childe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. Yea, euen I alone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04549">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. No, not so villaine, thou beliest thy selfe,<br>

Here stand a paire of honourable men,<br>

A third is fled that had a hand in it:<br>

I thanke you Princes for my daughters death,<br>

Record it with your high and worthie deedes,<br>

'Twas brauely done, if you bethinke you of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04550">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. I know not how to pray your patience,<br>

Yet I must speake, choose your reuenge your selfe,<br>

Impose me to what penance your inuention<br>

Can lay vpon my sinne, yet sinn'd I not,<br>

But in mistaking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04551">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. By my soule nor I,<br>

And yet to satisfie this good old man,<br>

I would bend vnder anie heauie waight,<br>

That heele enioyne me to<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04552">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. I cannot bid you bid my daughter liue,<br>

That were impossible, but I praie you both,<br>

Possesse the people in Messina here,<br>

How innocent she died, and if your loue<br>

Can labour aught in sad inuention,<br>

Hang her an epitaph vpon her toomb,<br>

And sing it to her bones, sing it to night:<br>

To morrow morning come you to my house,<br>

And since you could not be my sonne in law,<br>

Be yet my Nephew: my brother hath a daughter,<br>

Almost the copie of my childe that's dead,<br>

And she alone is heire to both of vs,<br>

Giue her the right you should haue giu'n her cosin,<br>

And so dies my reuenge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04553">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. O noble sir!<br>

Your ouerkindnesse doth wring teares from me,<br>

I do embrace your offer, and dispose<br>

For henceforth of poore Claudio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04554">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. To morrow then I will expect your comming,<br>

To night I take my leaue, this naughtie man<br>

Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,<br>

Who I beleeue was packt in all this wrong,<br>

Hired to it by your brother<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04555">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bor. No, by my soule she was not,<br>

Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,<br>

But alwaies hath bin iust and vertuous,<br>

In anie thing that I do know by her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04556"> Const. Moreouer sir, which indeede is not vnder white
and black, this plaintiffe here, the offendour did call mee
asse, I beseech you let it be remembred in his punishment,
and also the watch heard them talke of one Deformed,
they say he weares a key in his eare and a lock hanging
by it, and borrowes monie in Gods name, the which
he hath vs'd so long, and neuer paied, that now men grow
hard-harted and will lend nothing for Gods sake: praie
you examine him vpon that point</p><br>

<p id="id04557"> Leon. I thanke thee for thy care and honest paines</p><br>

well at my hands, by helping mee to the speech of Beatrice</p><br>

<p id="id04572"> Mar. Will you then write me a Sonnet in praise of

 Bene. In so high a stile Margaret, that no man liuing
shall come ouer it, for in most comely truth thou deseruest
it</p><br>

<p id="id04573">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. To haue no man come ouer me, why, shall I alwaies<br>

keepe below staires?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Thy wit is as quicke as the grey-hounds mouth,<br>

it catches<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04574">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. And yours, as blunt as the Fencers foiles, which<br>

hit, but hurt not<br>

<p id="id04580"> Ben. And therefore will come. The God of loue that
sits aboue, and knowes me, and knowes me, how pittifull
I deserue. I meane in singing, but in louing, Leander
the good swimmer, Troilous the first imploier of
pandars, and a whole booke full of these quondam carpet-mongers,
whose name yet runne smoothly in the euen
rode of a blanke verse, why they were neuer so truely
turned ouer and ouer as my poore selfe in loue: marrie
I cannot shew it rime, I haue tried, I can finde out no
rime to Ladie but babie, an innocent rime: for scorne,
horne, a hard rime: for schoole foole, a babling rime:
verie ominous endings, no, I was not borne vnder a riming
Plannet, for I cannot wooe in festiuall tearmes:
Enter Beatrice.</p><br>

<p id="id04581">sweete Beatrice would'st thou come when I cal'd

<p id="id04582"> Bene. O stay but till then</p><br>

<p id="id04583"> Beat. Then, is spoken: fare you well now, and yet ere
I goe, let me goe with that I came, which is, with knowing
what hath past betweene you and Claudio</p><br>

<p id="id04584" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bene. Onely foule words, and thereupon I will kisse
thee</p><br>

is but foule breath, and foule breath is noisome, therefore
I will depart vnkist</p><br>

<p id="id04586"> Bene. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right
sence, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainely,
Claudio vndergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly
heare from him, or I will subscribe him a coward, and
I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst
thou first fall in loue with me?
 Beat. For them all together, which maintain'd so
politique a state of euill, that they will not admit any
good part to intermingle with them: but for which of
my good parts did you first suffer loue for me?
 Bene. Suffer loue! a good epithite, I do suffer loue indeede,
for I loue thee against my will,
 Beat. In spight of your heart I think, alas poore heart,
if you spight it for my sake, I will spight it for yours, for
I will neuer loue that which my friend hates</p><br>

<p id="id04587"> Bened. Thou and I are too wise to wooe peaceablie</p><br>

weepes</p><br>

<p id="id04590"> Beat. And how long is that thinke you?
 Ben. Question, why an hower in clamour and a quarter
in rhewme, therfore is it most expedient for the wise,
if Don worme (his conscience) finde no impediment to
the contrarie, to be the trumpet of his owne vertues, as
I am to my selfe so much for praising my selfe, who I my
selfe will beare witnesse is praise worthie, and now tell
me, how doth your cosin?

A got a Calfe in that same noble feat,<br>

Much like to you, for you haue iust his bleat.<br>

Enter brother, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Vrsula.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04628">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. For this I owe you: here comes other recknings.<br>

Which is the Lady I must seize vpon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. This same is she, and I doe giue you her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04629"> Cla. Why then she's mine, sweet let me see your face</p><br>

<p id="id04630">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon. No that you shal not, till you take her hand,<br>

Before this Frier, and sweare to marry her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04631">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Giue me your hand before this holy Frier,<br>

I am your husband if you like of me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04632">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. And when I liu'd I was your other wife,<br>

And when you lou'd, you were my other husband<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04633">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. Another Hero?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. Nothing certainer.<br>

One Hero died, but I doe liue,<br>

And surely as I liue, I am a maid<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04634"> Prin. The former Hero, Hero that is dead</p><br>

<p id="id04635"> Leon. Shee died my Lord, but whiles her slander liu'd</p><br>

<p id="id04636">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frier. All this amazement can I qualifie,<br>

When after that the holy rites are ended,<br>

Ile tell you largely of faire Heroes death:<br>

Meane time let wonder seeme familiar,<br>

And to the chappell let vs presently<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04637">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben. Soft and faire Frier, which is Beatrice?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. I answer to that name, what is your will?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Doe not you loue me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Why no, no more then reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04638">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Why then your Vncle, and the Prince, &amp; Claudio,<br>

haue beene deceiued, they swore you did<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04639">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Doe not you loue mee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Troth no, no more then reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04640">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. Why then my Cosin Margaret and Vrsula<br>

Are much deceiu'd, for they did sweare you did<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04641"> Bene. They swore you were almost sicke for me</p><br>

<p id="id04642"> Beat. They swore you were wel-nye dead for me</p><br>

<p id="id04643">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. 'Tis no matter, then you doe not loue me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat. No truly, but in friendly recompence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04644"> Leon. Come Cosin, I am sure you loue the gentlema[n]</p><br>

<p id="id04645">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clau. And Ile be sworne vpon't, that he loues her,<br>

For heres a paper written in his hand,<br>

A halting sonnet of his owne pure braine,<br>

Fashioned to Beatrice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04646">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero. And heeres another,<br>

Writ in my cosins hand, stolne from her pocket,<br>

Containing her affection vnto Benedicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04647"> Bene. A miracle, here's our owne hands against our
hearts: come I will haue thee, but by this light I take
thee for pittie</p><br>

<p id="id04648"> Beat. I would not denie you, but by this good day, I
yeeld vpon great perswasion, &amp; partly to saue your life,
for I was told, you were in a consumption</p><br>

<p id="id04649"> Leon. Peace I will stop your mouth</p><br>

<p id="id04650"> Prin. How dost thou Benedicke the married man?
 Bene. Ile tell thee what Prince: a Colledge of witte-crackers
cannot flout mee out of my humour, dost thou
think I care for a Satyre or an Epigram? no, if a man will
be beaten with braines, a shall weare nothing handsome
about him: in briefe, since I do purpose to marry, I will
thinke nothing to any purpose that the world can say against
it, and therefore neuer flout at me, for I haue said
against it: for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion:
for thy part Claudio, I did thinke to haue beaten
thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, liue vnbruis'd,
and loue my cousin</p><br>

<p id="id04651"> Cla. I had well hop'd y wouldst haue denied Beatrice, y
I might haue cudgel'd thee out of thy single life, to make
thee a double dealer, which out of questio[n] thou wilt be,
if my Cousin do not looke exceeding narrowly to thee</p><br>

<p id="id04652"> Bene. Come, come, we are friends, let's haue a dance
ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts,
and our wiues heeles</p><br>

<p id="id04653"> Leon. Wee'll haue dancing afterward</p><br>

<p id="id04654"> Bene. First, of my word, therfore play musick. Prince,
thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife, there is no
staff more reuerend then one tipt with horn.
Enter. Mes.</p><br>

<p id="id04655">&nbsp;&nbsp;Messen. My Lord, your brother Iohn is tane in flight,<br>

And brought with armed men backe to Messina<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04656">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bene. Thinke not on him till to morrow, ile deuise<br>

thee braue punishments for him: strike vp Pipers.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04657">Dance.</p><br>

<p id="id04658">FINIS. Much adoe about Nothing.</p><br>

<p id="id04661">Enter Ferdinand King of Nauarre, Berowne, Longauill, and<br>

Dumane.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04662">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand. Let Fame, that all hunt after in their liues,<br>

Liue registred vpon our brazen Tombes,<br>

And then grace vs in the disgrace of death:<br>

when spight of cormorant deuouring Time,<br>

Th' endeuour of this present breath may buy:<br>

That honour which shall bate his sythes keene edge,<br>

And make vs heyres of all eternitie.<br>

Therefore braue Conquerours, for so you are,<br>

That warre against your owne affections,<br>

And the huge Armie of the worlds desires.<br>

Our late edict shall strongly stand in force,<br>

Nauar shall be the wonder of the world.<br>

Our Court shall be a little Achademe,<br>

Still and contemplatiue in liuing Art.<br>

You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longauill,<br>

Haue sworne for three yeeres terme, to liue with me:<br>

My fellow Schollers, and to keepe those statutes<br>

That are recorded in this scedule heere.<br>

Your oathes are past, and now subscribe your names:<br>

That his owne hand may strike his honour downe,<br>

That violates the smallest branch heerein:<br>

If you are arm'd to doe, as sworne to do,<br>

Subscribe to your deepe oathes, and keepe it to<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04663">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longauill. I am resolu'd, 'tis but a three yeeres fast:<br>

The minde shall banquet, though the body pine,<br>

Fat paunches haue leane pates: and dainty bits,<br>

Make rich the ribs, but bankerout the wits<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04664">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumane. My louing Lord, Dumane is mortified,<br>

The grosser manner of these worlds delights,<br>

He throwes vpon the grosse worlds baser slaues:<br>

To loue, to wealth, to pompe, I pine and die,<br>

With all these liuing in Philosophie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04665">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berowne. I can but say their protestation ouer,<br>

So much, deare Liege, I haue already sworne,<br>

That is, to liue and study heere three yeeres.<br>

But there are other strict obseruances:<br>

As not to see a woman in that terme,<br>

Which I hope well is not enrolled there.<br>

And one day in a weeke to touch no foode:<br>

And but one meale on euery day beside:<br>

The which I hope is not enrolled there.<br>

And then to sleepe but three houres in the night,<br>

And not be seene to winke of all the day.<br>

When I was wont to thinke no harme all night,<br>

And make a darke night too of halfe the day:<br>

Which I hope well is not enrolled there.<br>

O, these are barren taskes, too hard to keepe,<br>

Not to see Ladies, study, fast, not sleepe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04666"> Ferd. Your oath is past, to passe away from these</p><br>

<p id="id04667">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berow. Let me say no my Liedge, and if you please,<br>

I onely swore to study with your grace,<br>

And stay heere in your Court for three yeeres space<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04668"> Longa. You swore to that Berowne, and to the rest</p><br>

<p id="id04669">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berow. By yea and nay sir, than I swore in iest.<br>

What is the end of study, let me know?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. Why that to know which else wee should not<br>

know<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04670"> Ber. Things hid &amp; bard (you meane) fro[m] co[m]mon sense</p><br>

<p id="id04671"> Ferd. I, that is studies god-like recompence</p><br>

<p id="id04672">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bero. Come on then, I will sweare to studie so,<br>

To know the thing I am forbid to know:<br>

As thus, to study where I well may dine,<br>

When I to fast expressely am forbid.<br>

Or studie where to meete some Mistresse fine,<br>

When Mistresses from common sense are hid.<br>

Or hauing sworne too hard a keeping oath,<br>

Studie to breake it, and not breake my troth.<br>

If studies gaine be thus, and this be so,<br>

Studie knowes that which yet it doth not know,<br>

Sweare me to this, and I will nere say no<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04673">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferd. These be the stops that hinder studie quite,<br>

And traine our intellects to vaine delight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04674">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Why? all delights are vaine, and that most vaine<br>

Which with paine purchas'd, doth inherit paine,<br>

As painefully to poare vpon a Booke,<br>

To seeke the light of truth, while truth the while<br>

Doth falsely blinde the eye-sight of his looke:<br>

Light seeking light, doth light of light beguile:<br>

So ere you finde where light in darkenesse lies,<br>

Your light growes darke by losing of your eyes.<br>

Studie me how to please the eye indeede,<br>

By fixing it vpon a fairer eye,<br>

Who dazling so, that eye shall be his heed,<br>

And giue him light that it was blinded by.<br>

Studie is like the heauens glorious Sunne,<br>

That will not be deepe search'd with sawcy lookes:<br>

Small haue continuall plodders euer wonne,<br>

Saue base authoritie from others Bookes.<br>

These earthly Godfathers of heauens lights,<br>

That giue a name to euery fixed Starre,<br>

Haue no more profit of their shining nights,<br>

Then those that walke and wot not what they are.<br>

Too much to know, is to know nought but fame:<br>

And euery Godfather can giue a name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04675"> Fer. How well hee's read, to reason against reading</p><br>

<p id="id04676"> Dum. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding</p><br>

<p id="id04677">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon. Hee weedes the corne, and still lets grow the<br>

weeding<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04678">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. The Spring is neare when greene geesse are a<br>

breeding<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04679">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dum. How followes that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Fit in his place and time<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04680"> Dum. In reason nothing</p><br>

<p id="id04681"> Ber. Something then in rime</p><br>

<p id="id04682">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferd. Berowne is like an enuious sneaping Frost,<br>

That bites the first borne infants of the Spring<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04683">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Wel, say I am, why should proud Summer boast,<br>

Before the Birds haue any cause to sing?<br>

Why should I ioy in any abortiue birth?<br>

At Christmas I no more desire a Rose,<br>

Then wish a Snow in Mayes new fangled showes:<br>

But like of each thing that in season growes.<br>

So you to studie now it is too late,<br>

That were to clymbe ore the house to vnlocke the gate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04684"> Fer. Well, sit you out: go home Berowne: adue</p><br>

<p id="id04685">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. No my good Lord, I haue sworn to stay with you.<br>

And though I haue for barbarisme spoke more,<br>

Then for that Angell knowledge you can say,<br>

Yet confident Ile keepe what I haue sworne,<br>

And bide the pennance of each three yeares day.<br>

Giue me the paper, let me reade the same,<br>

And to the strictest decrees Ile write my name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04686"> Fer. How well this yeelding rescues thee from shame</p><br>

<p id="id04687">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Item. That no woman shall come within a mile<br>

of my Court.<br>

Hath this bin proclaimed?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon. Foure dayes agoe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04688">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Let's see the penaltie.<br>

On paine of loosing her tongue.<br>

Who deuis'd this penaltie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon. Marry that did I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04689"> Ber. Sweete Lord, and why?
 Lon. To fright them hence with that dread penaltie,
A dangerous law against gentilitie.
Item, If any man be seene to talke with a woman within
the tearme of three yeares, hee shall indure such
publique shame as the rest of the Court shall possibly
deuise</p><br>

<p id="id04690">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. This Article my Liedge your selfe must breake,<br>

For well you know here comes in Embassie<br>

The French Kings daughter, with your selfe to speake:<br>

A Maide of grace and compleate maiestie,<br>

About surrender vp of Aquitaine:<br>

To her decrepit, sicke, and bed-rid Father.<br>

Therefore this Article is made in vaine,<br>

Or vainly comes th' admired Princesse hither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04691">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. What say you Lords?<br>

Why, this was quite forgot<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04692">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. So Studie euermore is ouershot,<br>

While it doth study to haue what it would,<br>

It doth forget to doe the thing it should:<br>

And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,<br>

'Tis won as townes with fire, so won, so lost<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04693">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. We must of force dispence with this Decree,<br>

She must lye here on meere necessitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04694">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Necessity will make vs all forsworne<br>

Three thousand times within this three yeeres space:<br>

For euery man with his affects is borne,<br>

Not by might mastred, but by speciall grace.<br>

If I breake faith, this word shall breake for me,<br>

I am forsworne on meere necessitie.<br>

So to the Lawes at large I write my name,<br>

And he that breakes them in the least degree,<br>

Stands in attainder of eternall shame.<br>

Suggestions are to others as to me:<br>

But I beleeue although I seeme so loth,<br>

I am the last that will last keepe his oth.<br>

But is there no quicke recreation granted?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fer. I that there is, our Court you know is hanted<br>

With a refined trauailer of Spaine,<br>

A man in all the worlds new fashion planted,<br>

That hath a mint of phrases in his braine:<br>

One, who the musicke of his owne vaine tongue,<br>

Doth rauish like inchanting harmonie:<br>

A man of complements whom right and wrong<br>

Haue chose as vmpire of their mutinie.<br>

This childe of fancie that Armado hight,<br>

For interim to our studies shall relate,<br>

In high-borne words the worth of many a Knight:<br>

From tawnie Spaine lost in the worlds debate.<br>

How you delight my Lords, I know not I,<br>

But I protest I loue to heare him lie,<br>

And I will vse him for my Minstrelsie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04695">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bero. Armado is a most illustrious wight,<br>

A man of fire, new words, fashions owne Knight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04696">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon. Costard the swaine and he, shall be our sport,<br>

And so to studie, three yeeres is but short.<br>

Enter a Constable with Costard with a Letter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04697"> Const. Which is the Dukes owne person</p><br>

<p id="id04698">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. This fellow, What would'st?<br>

The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04709"> Ber. In what manner?
 Clo. In manner and forme following sir all those three.
I was seene with her in the Mannor house, sitting with
her vpon the Forme, and taken following her into the

following. Now sir for the manner; It is the manner
of a man to speake to a woman, for the forme in some

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. As we would heare an Oracle<br>

<p id="id04770"> Brag. I will heereupon confesse I am in loue: and as
it is base for a Souldier to loue; so am I in loue with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection, would deliuer mee from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransome
him to any French Courtier for a new deuis'd curtsie. I
thinke scorne to sigh, me thinkes I should out-sweare
Cupid. Comfort me Boy, What great men haue beene
in loue?
 Boy. Hercules Master</p><br>

<p id="id04771"> Brag. Most sweete Hercules: more authority deare
Boy, name more; and sweet my childe let them be men
of good repute and carriage</p><br>

<p id="id04772"> Boy. Sampson Master, he was a man of good carriage,
great carriage: for hee carried the Towne-gates on his
backe like a Porter: and he was in loue</p><br>

<p id="id04773">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. O well-knit Sampson, strong ioynted Sampson;<br>

I doe excell thee in my rapier, as much as thou didst mee<br>

in carrying gates. I am in loue too. Who was Sampsons<br>

loue my deare Moth?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. A Woman, Master<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04774">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. Of what complexion?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Of all the foure, or the three, or the two, or one<br>

of the foure<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04775">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. Tell me precisely of what complexion?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Of the sea-water Greene sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04776">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. Is that one of the foure complexions?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. As I haue read sir, and the best of them too<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04777"> Brag. Greene indeed is the colour of Louers: but to
haue a Loue of that colour, methinkes Sampson had small
reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit</p><br>

<p id="id04778"> Boy. It was so sir, for she had a greene wit</p><br>

<p id="id04779"> Brag. My Loue is most immaculate white and red</p><br>

patheticall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04784">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. If shee be made of white and red,<br>

Her faults will nere be knowne:<br>

For blushin cheekes by faults are bred,<br>

And feares by pale white showne:<br>

Then if she feare, or be to blame,<br>

By this you shall not know,<br>

For still her cheekes possesse the same,<br>

Which natiue she doth owe:<br>

A dangerous rime master against the reason of white<br>

if it were, it would neither serue for the writing, nor the
tune</p><br>

that be true loue, which is falsly attempted? Loue is a familiar,
Loue is a Diuell. There is no euill Angell but
Loue, yet Sampson was so tempted, and he had an excellent

One paiment of a hundred thousand Crownes,<br>

To haue his title liue in Aquitaine.<br>

To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.<br>

His hart like an Agot with your print impressed,<br>

Proud with his forme, in his eie pride expressed.<br>

His tongue all impatient to speake and not see,<br>

Did stumble with haste in his eie-sight to be,<br>

All sences to that sence did make their repaire,<br>

To feele onely looking on fairest of faire:<br>

Me thought all his sences were lockt in his eye,<br>

As Iewels in Christall for some Prince to Buy.<br>

Who tendring their own worth from whence they were glast,<br>

Did point out to buy them along as you past.<br>

His faces owne margent did coate such amazes,<br>

That all eyes saw his eies inchanted with gazes.<br>

 Boy. No my compleat master, but to Iigge off a tune
at the tongues end, canarie to it with the feete, humour
it with turning vp your eie: sigh a note and sing a note,
sometime through the throate: if you swallowed loue
with singing, loue sometime through: nose as if you
snuft vp loue by smelling loue with your hat penthouselike

these are complements, these are humours, these betraie

thought, my spleene, the heauing of my lunges prouokes<br>

me to rediculous smyling: O pardon me my stars, doth<br>

the inconsiderate take salue for lenuoy, and the word lenuoy<br>

for a salue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pag. Doe the wise thinke them other, is not lenuoy a<br>

salue?<br>

Some obscure precedence that hath tofore bin faine.<br>

Sir, your penny-worth is good, and your Goose be fat.<br>

Let me see a fat Lenuoy, I that's a fat Goose<br>

<p id="id04948">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Come hither, come hither:<br>

How did this argument begin?<br>

Then cal'd you for the Lenuoy<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id04949">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. True, and I for a Plantan:<br>

Thus came your argument in:<br>

Then the Boyes fat Lenuoy, the Goose that you bought,<br>

And he ended the market<br>

side? the King: the captiue is inricht: On whose side?
the Beggers. The catastrophe is a Nuptiall: on whose
side? the Kings: no, on both in one, or one in both. I am
the King (for so stands the comparison) thou the Begger,
for so witnesseth thy lowlinesse. Shall I command
thy loue? I may. Shall I enforce thy loue? I could.
Shall I entreate thy loue? I will. What, shalt thou exchange
for ragges, roabes: for tittles titles, for thy selfe
mee. Thus expecting thy reply, I prophane my lips on
thy foote, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy
euerie part.
Thine in the dearest designe of industrie,
Don Adriana de Armatho.
Thus dost thou heare the Nemean Lion roare,
Gainst thee thou Lambe, that standest as his pray:
Submissiue fall his princely feete before,
And he from forrage will incline to play.
But if thou striue (poore soule) what art thou then?
Foode for his rage, repasture for his den</p><br>

Though to my selfe forsworn, to thee Ile faithfull proue.<br>

Well learned is that tongue, that well can thee co[m]mend.<br>

Thy eye Ioues lightning beares, thy voyce his dreadfull<br>

Wish himselfe the heauens breath.<br>

Ayre (quoth he) thy cheekes may blowe,<br>

Ayre, would I might triumph so.<br>

But alacke my hand is sworne,<br>

Nere to plucke thee from thy throne:<br>

Vow alacke for youth vnmeete,<br>

youth so apt to plucke a sweet.<br>

Doe not call it sinne in me,<br>

That I am forsworne for thee.<br>

Thou for whom Ioue would sweare,<br>

Iuno but an aethiop were,<br>

And denie himselfe for Ioue.<br>

Turning mortall for thy Loue.<br>

This will I send, and something else more plaine.<br>

That shall expresse my true-loues fasting paine.<br>

O would the King, Berowne and Longauill,<br>

Were Louers too, ill to example ill,<br>

Would from my forehead wipe a periur'd note:<br>

For none offend, where all alike doe dote<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05106">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon. Dumaine, thy Loue is farre from charitie,<br>

That in Loues griefe desir'st societie:<br>

You may looke pale, but I should blush I know,<br>

To be ore-heard, and taken napping so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Come sir, you blush: as his, your case is such,<br>

You chide at him, offending twice as much.<br>

You doe not loue Maria? Longauile,<br>

Did neuer Sonnet for her sake compile;<br>

Nor neuer lay his wreathed armes athwart<br>

His louing bosome, to keepe downe his heart.<br>

I haue beene closely shrowded in this bush,<br>

And markt you both, and for you both did blush.<br>

I heard your guilty Rimes, obseru'd your fashion:<br>

Saw sighes reeke from you, noted well your passion.<br>

Aye me, sayes one! O Ioue, the other cries!<br>

On her haires were Gold, Christall the others eyes.<br>

You would for Paradise breake Faith and troth,<br>

And Ioue for your Loue would infringe an oath.<br>

What will Berowne say when that he shall heare<br>

Faith infringed, which such zeale did sweare.<br>

How will he scorne? how will he spend his wit?<br>

How will he triumph, leape, and laugh at it?<br>

For all the wealth that euer I did see,<br>

I would not haue him know so much by me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05108">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bero. Now step I forth to whip hypocrisie.<br>

Ah good my Liedge, I pray thee pardon me.<br>

Good heart, What grace hast thou thus to reproue<br>

These wormes for louing, that art most in loue?<br>

Your eyes doe make no couches in your teares.<br>

There is no certaine Princesse that appeares.<br>

You'll not be periur'd, 'tis a hatefull thing:<br>

Tush, none but Minstrels like of Sonnetting.<br>

But are you not asham'd? nay, are you not<br>

All three of you, to be thus much ore'shot?<br>

You found his Moth, the King your Moth did see:<br>

But I a Beame doe finde in each of three.<br>

O what a Scene of fool'ry haue I seene.<br>

Of sighes, of grones, of sorrow, and of teene:<br>

O me, with what strict patience haue I sat,<br>

To see a King transformed to a Gnat?<br>

To see great Hercules whipping a Gigge,<br>

And profound Salomon tuning a Iygge?<br>

And Nestor play at push-pin with the boyes,<br>

And Critticke Tymon laugh at idle toyes.<br>

Where lies thy griefe? O tell me good Dumaine;<br>

And gentle Longauill, where lies thy paine?<br>

And where my Liedges? all about the brest:<br>

A Candle hoa!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Too bitter is thy iest.<br>

Are wee betrayed thus to thy ouer-view?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Not you by me, but I betrayed to you.<br>

I that am honest, I that hold it sinne<br>

To breake the vow I am ingaged in.<br>

I am betrayed by keeping company<br>

With men, like men of inconstancie.<br>

When shall you see me write a thing in rime?<br>

Or grone for Ioane? or spend a minutes time,<br>

In pruning mee, when shall you heare that I will praise a<br>

hand, a foot, a face, an eye: a gate, a state, a brow, a brest,<br>

a waste, a legge, a limme<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05109">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Soft, Whither away so fast?<br>

A true man, or a theefe, that gallops so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05110">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. I post from Loue, good Louer let me go.<br>

Enter Iaquenetta and Clowne.<br>

<p id="id05111"> Iaqu. God blesse the King</p><br>

<p id="id05112">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. What Present hast thou there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Some certaine treason<br>

<p id="id05113">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. What makes treason heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Nay it makes nothing sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05114">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. If it marre nothing neither,<br>

The treason and you goe in peace away together<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05115">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaqu. I beseech your Grace let this Letter be read,<br>

Our person mis-doubts it: it was treason he said<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. A toy my Liedge, a toy: your grace needes not<br>

feare it<br>

heare it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05122"> Dum. It is Berowns writing, and heere is his name</p><br>

<p id="id05123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Ah you whoreson loggerhead, you were borne<br>

to doe me shame.<br>

Guilty my Lord, guilty: I confesse, I confesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05124">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. What?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. That you three fooles, lackt mee foole, to make<br>

He, he, and you: and you my Liedge, and I,<br>

Are picke-purses in Loue, and we deserue to die.<br>

O dismisse this audience, and I shall tell you more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05125"> Dum. Now the number is euen</p><br>

<p id="id05126">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berow. True true, we are fowre: will these Turtles<br>

be gone?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Hence sirs, away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05127"> Clo. Walk aside the true folke, &amp; let the traytors stay</p><br>

<p id="id05128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Sweet Lords, sweet Louers, O let vs imbrace,<br>

As true we are as flesh and bloud can be,<br>

The Sea will ebbe and flow, heauen will shew his face:<br>

Young bloud doth not obey an old decree.<br>

We cannot crosse the cause why we are borne:<br>

Therefore of all hands must we be forsworne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05129">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. What, did these rent lines shew some loue of<br>

thine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heauenly Rosaline,<br>

That (like a rude and sauage man of Inde.)<br>

At the first opening of the gorgeous East,<br>

Bowes not his vassall head, and strooken blinde,<br>

Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?<br>

What peremptory Eagle-sighted eye<br>

Dares looke vpon the heauen of her brow,<br>

That is not blinded by her maiestie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. What zeale, what furie, hath inspir'd thee now?<br>

My Loue (her Mistres) is a gracious Moone,<br>

Shee (an attending Starre) scarce seene a light<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05130">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.<br>

O, but for my Loue, day would turne to night,<br>

Of all complexions the cul'd soueraignty,<br>

Doe meet as at a faire in her faire cheeke,<br>

Where seuerall Worthies make one dignity,<br>

Where nothing wants, that want it selfe doth seeke.<br>

Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,<br>

Fie painted Rethoricke, O she needs it not,<br>

To things of sale, a sellers praise belongs:<br>

She passes prayse, then prayse too short doth blot.<br>

A withered Hermite, fiuescore winters worne,<br>

Might shake off fiftie, looking in her eye:<br>

Beauty doth varnish Age, as if new borne,<br>

And giues the Crutch the Cradles infancie.<br>

O 'tis the Sunne that maketh all things shine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05131"> King. By heauen, thy Loue is blacke as Ebonie</p><br>

<p id="id05132">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berow. Is Ebonie like her? O word diuine?<br>

A wife of such wood were felicite.<br>

O who can giue an oth? Where is a booke?<br>

That I may sweare Beauty doth beauty lacke,<br>

If that she learne not of her eye to looke:<br>

No face is faire that is not full so blacke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05133">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. O paradoxe, Blacke is the badge of hell,<br>

The hue of dungeons, and the Schoole of night:<br>

And beauties crest becomes the heauens well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05134">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Diuels soonest tempt resembling spirits of light.<br>

O if in blacke my Ladies browes be deckt,<br>

It mournes, that painting vsurping haire<br>

Should rauish doters with a false aspect:<br>

And therfore is she borne to make blacke, faire.<br>

Her fauour turnes the fashion of the dayes,<br>

For natiue bloud is counted painting now:<br>

And therefore red that would auoyd dispraise,<br>

Paints it selfe blacke, to imitate her brow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05135"> Dum. To look like her are Chimny-sweepers blacke</p><br>

<p id="id05136"> Lon. And since her time, are Colliers counted bright</p><br>

<p id="id05137"> King. And Aethiops of their sweet complexion crake</p><br>

<p id="id05138"> Dum. Dark needs no Candles now, for dark is light</p><br>

<p id="id05139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Your mistresses dare neuer come in raine,<br>

For feare their colours should be washt away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. 'Twere good yours did: for sir to tell you plaine,<br>

Ile finde a fairer face not washt to day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05141"> Ber. Ile proue her faire, or talke till dooms-day here</p><br>

<p id="id05142"> Kin. No Diuell will fright thee then so much as shee</p><br>

<p id="id05144"> Lon. Looke, heer's thy loue, my foot and her face see</p><br>

<p id="id05145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. O if the streets were paued with thine eyes,<br>

Her feet were much too dainty for such tread<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05146">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duma. O vile, then as she goes what vpward lyes?<br>

The street should see as she walk'd ouer head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05147">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. But what of this, are we not all in loue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. O nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05148">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Then leaue this chat, &amp; good Berown now proue<br>

Our louing lawfull, and our fayth not torne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05149"> Dum. I marie there, some flattery for this euill</p><br>

<p id="id05150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long. O some authority how to proceed,<br>

Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the diuell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05151">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dum. Some salue for periurie,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. O 'tis more then neede.<br>

Haue at you then affections men at armes,<br>

Consider what you first did sweare vnto:<br>

To fast, to study, and to see no woman:<br>

Flat treason against the Kingly state of youth.<br>

Say, Can you fast? your stomacks are too young:<br>

And abstinence ingenders maladies.<br>

And where that you haue vow'd to studie (Lords)<br>

In that each of you haue forsworne his Booke.<br>

Can you still dreame and pore, and thereon looke.<br>

For when would you my Lord, or you, or you,<br>

Haue found the ground of studies excellence,<br>

Without the beauty of a womans face;<br>

From womens eyes this doctrine I deriue,<br>

They are the Ground, the Bookes, the Achadems,<br>

From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.<br>

Why, vniuersall plodding poysons vp<br>

The nimble spirits in the arteries,<br>

As motion and long during action tyres<br>

The sinnowy vigour of the trauailer.<br>

Now for not looking on a womans face,<br>

You haue in that forsworne the vse of eyes:<br>

And studie too, the causer of your vow.<br>

For where is any Author in the world,<br>

Teaches such beauty as a womans eye:<br>

Learning is but an adiunct to our selfe,<br>

And where we are, our Learning likewise is.<br>

Then when our selues we see in Ladies eyes,<br>

With our selues.<br>

Doe we not likewise see our learning there?<br>

O we haue made a Vow to studie, Lords,<br>

And in that vow we haue forsworne our Bookes:<br>

For when would you (my Leege) or you, or you?<br>

In leaden contemplation haue found out<br>

Such fiery Numbers as the prompting eyes,<br>

Of beauties tutors haue inrich'd you with:<br>

Other slow Arts intirely keepe the braine:<br>

And therefore finding barraine practizers,<br>

Scarce shew a haruest of their heauy toyle.<br>

But Loue first learned in a Ladies eyes,<br>

Liues not alone emured in the braine:<br>

But with the motion of all elements,<br>

Courses as swift as thought in euery power,<br>

And giues to euery power a double power,<br>

Aboue their functions and their offices.<br>

It addes a precious seeing to the eye:<br>

A Louers eyes will gaze an Eagle blinde.<br>

A Louers eare will heare the lowest sound.<br>

When the suspicious head of theft is stopt.<br>

Loues feeling is more soft and sensible,<br>

Then are the tender hornes of Cockle Snayles.<br>

Loues tongue proues dainty, Bachus grosse in taste,<br>

For Valour, is not Loue a Hercules?<br>

Still climing trees in the Hesperides.<br>

Subtill as Sphinx, as sweet and musicall,<br>

As bright Apollo's Lute, strung with his haire.<br>

And when Loue speakes, the voyce of all the Gods,<br>

Make heauen drowsie with the harmonie.<br>

Neuer durst Poet touch a pen to write,<br>

Vntill his Inke were tempred with Loues sighes:<br>

O then his lines would rauish sauage eares,<br>

And plant in Tyrants milde humilitie.<br>

From womens eyes this doctrine I deriue.<br>

They sparcle still the right promethean fire,<br>

They are the Bookes, the Arts, the Achademes,<br>

That shew, containe, and nourish all the world.<br>

Else none at all in ought proues excellent.<br>

Then fooles you were these women to forsweare:<br>

Or keeping what is sworne, you will proue fooles,<br>

For Wisedomes sake, a word that all men loue:<br>

Or for Loues sake, a word that loues all men.<br>

Or for Mens sake, the author of these Women:<br>

Or Womens sake, by whom we men are Men.<br>

Let's once loose our oathes to finde our selues,<br>

Or else we loose our selues, to keepe our oathes:<br>

It is religion to be thus forsworne.<br>

For Charity it selfe fulfills the Law:<br>

And who can seuer loue from Charity<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05152"> Kin. Saint Cupid then, and Souldiers to the field</p><br>

<p id="id05153">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Aduance your standards, &amp; vpon them Lords,<br>

Pell, mell, downe with them: but be first aduis'd,<br>

In conflict that you get the Sunne of them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05154">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long. Now to plaine dealing, Lay these glozes by,<br>

Shall we resolue to woe these girles of France?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. And winne them too, therefore let vs deuise,<br>

Some entertainment for them in their Tents<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. First from the Park let vs conduct them thither,<br>

Then homeward euery man attach the hand<br>

Of his faire Mistresse, in the afternoone<br>

We will with some strange pastime solace them:<br>

Such as the shortnesse of the time can shape,<br>

For Reuels, Dances, Maskes, and merry houres,<br>

Fore-runne faire Loue, strewing her way with flowres<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05156">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Away, away, no time shall be omitted,<br>

That will be time, and may by vs be fitted<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05157">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Alone, alone sowed Cockell, reap'd no Corne,<br>

And Iustice alwaies whirles in equall measure:<br>

Light Wenches may proue plagues to men forsworne,<br>

If so, our Copper buyes no better treasure.<br>

<p id="id05194">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curat. Where will you finde men worthy enough to<br>

present them?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Peda. Iosua, your selfe: my selfe, and this gallant gentleman<br>

Iudas Machabeus; this Swaine (because of his<br>

great limme or ioynt) shall passe Pompey the great, the<br>

Page Hercules<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05195"> Brag. Pardon sir, error: He is not quantitie enough
for that Worthies thumb, hee is not so big as the end of
his Club</p><br>

<p id="id05196"> Peda. Shall I haue audience: he shall present Hercules
in minoritie: his enter and exit shall bee strangling a
Snake; and I will haue an Apologie for that purpose</p><br>

<p id="id05197"> Pag. An excellent deuice: so if any of the audience
hisse, you may cry, Well done Hercules, now thou crushest
the Snake; that is the way to make an offence gracious,
though few haue the grace to doe it</p><br>

<p id="id05198">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. For the rest of the Worthies?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Peda. I will play three my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05199"> Pag. Thrice worthy Gentleman</p><br>

<p id="id05200">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. Shall I tell you a thing?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Peda. We attend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05201">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. We will haue, if this fadge not, an Antique. I<br>

beseech you follow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05202">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ped. Via good-man Dull, thou hast spoken no word<br>

all this while<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05203"> Dull. Nor vnderstood none neither sir</p><br>

<p id="id05204"> Ped. Alone, we will employ thee</p><br>

<p id="id05205">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull. Ile make one in a dance, or so: or I will play<br>

on the taber to the Worthies, &amp; let them dance the hey<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05206">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ped. Most Dull, honest Dull, to our sport away.<br>

<p id="id05207">Enter Ladies.</p><br>

<p id="id05208">&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart,<br>

If fairings come thus plentifully in.<br>

A Lady wal'd about with Diamonds: Look you, what I<br>

haue from the louing King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05209">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. Madam, came nothing else along with that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Nothing but this: yes as much loue in Rime,<br>

As would be cram'd vp in a sheet of paper<br>

Writ on both sides the leafe, margent and all,<br>

That he was faine to seale on Cupids name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05210">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. That was the way to make his god-head wax:<br>

For he hath beene fiue thousand yeeres a Boy<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05211"> Kath. I, and a shrewd vnhappy gallowes too</p><br>

<p id="id05212"> Ros. You'll nere be friends with him, a kild your sister</p><br>

<p id="id05213"> Kath. He made her melancholy, sad, and heauy, and
so she died: had she beene Light like you, of such a merrie
nimble stirring spirit, she might a bin a Grandam ere
she died. And so may you: For a light heart liues long</p><br>

<p id="id05214">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. What's your darke meaning mouse, of this light<br>

word?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. A light condition in a beauty darke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05215"> Ros. We need more light to finde your meaning out</p><br>

<p id="id05216">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. You'll marre the light by taking it in snuffe:<br>

Therefore Ile darkely end the argument<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05217"> Ros. Look what you doe, you doe it stil i'th darke</p><br>

<p id="id05218"> Kat. So do not you, for you are a light Wench</p><br>

<p id="id05219"> Ros. Indeed I waigh not you, and therefore light</p><br>

<p id="id05220"> Ka. You waigh me not, O that's you care not for me</p><br>

<p id="id05221"> Ros. Great reason: for past care, is still past cure</p><br>

<p id="id05222">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Well bandied both, a set of Wit well played.<br>

But Rosaline, you haue a Fauour too?<br>

Who sent it? and what is it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I would you knew.<br>

And if my face were but as faire as yours,<br>

My Fauour were as great, be witnesse this.<br>

Nay, I haue Verses too, I thanke Berowne,<br>

The numbers true, and were the numbring too.<br>

I were the fairest goddesse on the ground.<br>

I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs.<br>

O he hath drawne my picture in his letter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05223">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Any thing like?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Much in the letters, nothing in the praise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05224"> Qu. Beauteous as Incke: a good conclusion</p><br>

<p id="id05225"> Kat. Faire as a text B. in a Coppie booke</p><br>

My red Dominicall, my golden letter.<br>

O that your face were full of Oes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. A Pox of that iest, and I beshrew all Shrowes:<br>

But Katherine, what was sent to you<br>

From faire Dumaine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. Madame, this Gloue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05228">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Did he not send you twaine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. Yes Madame: and moreouer,<br>

Some thousand Verses of a faithfull Louer.<br>

A huge translation of hypocrisie,<br>

Vildly compiled, profound simplicitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. This, and these Pearls, to me sent Longauile.<br>

The Letter is too long by halfe a mile<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05230">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. I thinke no lesse: Dost thou wish in heart<br>

The Chaine were longer, and the Letter short<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05231"> Mar. I, or I would these hands might neuer part</p><br>

<p id="id05232"> Quee. We are wise girles to mocke our Louers so</p><br>

<p id="id05233">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. They are worse fooles to purchase mocking so.<br>

That same Berowne ile torture ere I goe.<br>

O that I knew he were but in by th' weeke,<br>

How I would make him fawne, and begge, and seeke,<br>

And wait the season, and obserue the times,<br>

And spend his prodigall wits in booteles rimes,<br>

And shape his seruice wholly to my deuice,<br>

And make him proud to make me proud that iests.<br>

So pertaunt like would I o'resway his state,<br>

That he shold be my foole, and I his fate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. None are so surely caught, when they are catcht,<br>

As Wit turn'd foole, follie in Wisedome hatch'd:<br>

Hath wisedoms warrant, and the helpe of Schoole,<br>

And Wits owne grace to grace a learned Foole?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. The bloud of youth burns not with such excesse,<br>

As grauities reuolt to wantons be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Follie in Fooles beares not so strong a note,<br>

As fool'ry in the Wise, when Wit doth dote:<br>

Since all the power thereof it doth apply,<br>

To proue by Wit, worth in simplicitie.<br>

Enter Boyet.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05236"> Qu. Heere comes Boyet, and mirth in his face</p><br>

<p id="id05237">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. O I am stab'd with laughter, Wher's her Grace?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Thy newes Boyet?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Prepare Madame, prepare.<br>

Arme Wenches arme, incounters mounted are,<br>

Against your Peace, Loue doth approach, disguis'd:<br>

Armed in arguments, you'll be surpriz'd.<br>

Muster your Wits, stand in your owne defence,<br>

Or hide your heads like Cowards, and flie hence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05238">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Saint Dennis to S[aint]. Cupid: What are they,<br>

That charge their breath against vs? Say scout say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Vnder the coole shade of a Siccamore,<br>

I thought to close mine eyes some halfe an houre:<br>

When lo to interrupt my purpos'd rest,<br>

Toward that shade I might behold addrest,<br>

The King and his companions: warely<br>

I stole into a neighbour thicket by,<br>

And ouer-heard, what you shall ouer-heare:<br>

That by and by disguis'd they will be heere.<br>

Their Herald is a pretty knauish Page:<br>

That well by heart hath con'd his embassage,<br>

Action and accent did they teach him there.<br>

Thus must thou speake, and thus thy body beare.<br>

And euer and anon they made a doubt,<br>

Presence maiesticall would put him out:<br>

For quoth the King, an Angell shalt thou see:<br>

Yet feare not thou, but speake audaciously.<br>

The Boy reply'd, An Angell is not euill:<br>

I should haue fear'd her, had she beene a deuill.<br>

With that all laugh'd, and clap'd him on the shoulder,<br>

Making the bold wagg by their praises bolder.<br>

One rub'd his elboe thus, and fleer'd, and swore,<br>

A better speech was neuer spoke before.<br>

Another with his finger and his thumb,<br>

Cry'd via, we will doo't, come what will come.<br>

The third he caper'd and cried, All goes well.<br>

The fourth turn'd on the toe, and downe he fell:<br>

With that they all did tumble on the ground,<br>

With such a zelous laughter so profound,<br>

That in this spleene ridiculous appeares,<br>

To checke their folly passions solemne teares<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05240">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Que. But what, but what, come they to visit vs?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. They do, they do; and are apparel'd thus,<br>

Like Muscouites; or Russians, as I gesse.<br>

Their purpose is to parlee, to court, and dance,<br>

And euery one his Loue-feat will aduance,<br>

Vnto his seuerall mistresse: which they'll know<br>

By fauours seuerall, which they did bestow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen. And will they so? the Gallants shall be taskt:<br>

For Ladies; we will euery one be maskt,<br>

And not a man of them shall haue the grace<br>

Despight of sute, to see a Ladies face.<br>

Hold Rosaline, this Fauour thou shalt weare,<br>

And then the King will court thee for his Deare:<br>

Hold, take thou this my sweet, and giue me thine,<br>

So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.<br>

And change your Fauours too, so shall your Loues<br>

Woo contrary, deceiu'd by these remoues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05242"> Rosa. Come on then, weare the fauours most in sight</p><br>

<p id="id05243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. But in this changing, What is your intent?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen. The effect of my intent is to crosse theirs:<br>

They doe it but in mocking merriment,<br>

And mocke for mocke is onely my intent.<br>

Their seuerall counsels they vnbosome shall,<br>

To Loues mistooke, and so be mockt withall.<br>

Vpon the next occasion that we meete,<br>

With Visages displayd to talke and greete<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05244">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But shall we dance, if they desire vs too't?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quee. No, to the death we will not moue a foot,<br>

Nor to their pen'd speech render we no grace:<br>

But while 'tis spoke, each turne away his face<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Why that contempt will kill the keepers heart,<br>

And quite diuorce his memory from his part<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05246">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quee. Therefore I doe it, and I make no doubt,<br>

The rest will ere come in, if he be out.<br>

Theres no such sport, as sport by sport orethrowne:<br>

To make theirs ours, and ours none but our owne.<br>

So shall we stay mocking entended game,<br>

And they well mockt, depart away with shame.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05247">Sound.</p><br>

<p id="id05248">&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. The Trompet sounds, be maskt, the maskers<br>

come.<br>

Enter Black moores with musicke, the Boy with a speech, and the<br>

rest of<br>

the Lords disguised.<br>
</p><br>

That some plaine man recount their purposes.<br>

To tread a Measure with you on the grasse<br>

<p id="id05266">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. They say that they haue measur'd many a mile,<br>

To tread a Measure with you on this grasse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05267">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. It is not so. Aske them how many inches<br>

Is in one mile? If they haue measur'd manie,<br>

The measure then of one is easlie told<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05268">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. If to come hither, you haue measur'd miles,<br>

How many inches doth fill vp one mile?<br>

Our dutie is so rich, so infinite,<br>

Wee'll not be nice, take hands, we will not dance<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05280">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Why take you hands then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. Onelie to part friends.<br>

Curtsie sweet hearts, and so the Measure ends<br>

<p id="id05281"> Kin. More measure of this measure, be not nice</p><br>

<p id="id05282"> Rosa. We can afford no more at such a price</p><br>

<p id="id05328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boyet. Madam, and prettie mistresses giue eare,<br>

Immediately they will againe be heere<br>

In their owne shapes: for it can neuer be,<br>

They will digest this harsh indignitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05329">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Will they returne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. They will they will, God knowes,<br>

And leape for ioy, though they are lame with blowes:<br>

Therefore change Fauours, and when they repaire,<br>

Blow like sweet Roses, in this summer aire<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05330"> Qu. How blow? how blow? Speake to bee vnderstood</p><br>

<p id="id05331">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Faire Ladies maskt, are Roses in their bud:<br>

Dismaskt, their damaske sweet commixture showne,<br>

Are Angels vailing clouds, or Roses blowne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05332">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Auant perplexitie: What shall we do,<br>

If they returne in their owne shapes to wo?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. Good Madam, if by me you'l be aduis'd.<br>

Let's mocke them still as well knowne as disguis'd:<br>

Let vs complaine to them what fooles were heare,<br>

Disguis'd like Muscouites in shapelesse geare:<br>

And wonder what they were, and to what end<br>

Their shallow showes, and Prologue vildely pen'd:<br>

And their rough carriage so ridiculous,<br>

Should be presented at our Tent to vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05333"> Boyet. Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand</p><br>

<p id="id05334"> Quee. Whip to our Tents, as Roes runnes ore Land.</p><br>

<p id="id05337">&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Faire sir, God saue you. Wher's the Princesse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Gone to her Tent.<br>

Please it your Maiestie command me any seruice to her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. That she vouchsafe me audience for one word<br>

<p id="id05338">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. I will, and so will she, I know my Lord.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05339">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. This fellow pickes vp wit as Pigeons pease,<br>

And vtters it againe, when Ioue doth please.<br>

He is Wits Pedler, and retailes his Wares,<br>

At Wakes, and Wassels, Meetings, Markets, Faires.<br>

And we that sell by grosse, the Lord doth know,<br>

Haue not the grace to grace it with such show.<br>

This Gallant pins the Wenches on his sleeue.<br>

Had he bin Adam, he had tempted Eue.<br>

He can carue too, and lispe: Why this is he,<br>

That kist away his hand in courtesie.<br>

This is the Ape of Forme, Monsieur the nice,<br>

That when he plaies at Tables, chides the Dice<br>

In honorable tearmes: Nay he can sing<br>

A meane most meanly, and in Vshering<br>

Mend him who can: the Ladies call him sweete.<br>

The staires as he treads on them kisse his feete.<br>

This is the flower that smiles on euerie one,<br>

To shew his teeth as white as Whales bone.<br>

And consciences that wil not die in debt,<br>

Pay him the dutie of honie-tongued Boyet<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05340">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. A blister on his sweet tongue with my hart,<br>

That put Armathoes Page out of his part.<br>

Enter the Ladies.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05341">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. See where it comes. Behauiour what wer't thou,<br>

Till this madman shew'd thee? And what art thou now?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. All haile sweet Madame, and faire time of day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05342"> Qu. Faire in all Haile is foule, as I conceiue</p><br>

<p id="id05343"> King. Construe my speeches better, if you may</p><br>

<p id="id05344"> Qu. Then wish me better, I wil giue you leaue</p><br>

<p id="id05345">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We came to visit you, and purpose now<br>

To leade you to our Court, vouchsafe it then<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05346">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. This field shal hold me, and so hold your vow:<br>

Nor God, nor I, delights in periur'd men<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05347">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Rebuke me not for that which you prouoke:<br>

The vertue of your eie must breake my oth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05348">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. You nickname vertue: vice you should haue spoke:<br>

For vertues office neuer breakes men troth.<br>

Now by my maiden honor, yet as pure<br>

As the vnsallied Lilly, I protest,<br>

A world of torments though I should endure,<br>

I would not yeeld to be your houses guest:<br>

So much I hate a breaking cause to be<br>

Of heauenly oaths, vow'd with integritie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05349">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. O you haue liu'd in desolation heere,<br>

Vnseene, vnuisited, much to our shame<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Not so my Lord, it is not so I sweare,<br>

We haue had pastimes heere, and pleasant game,<br>

A messe of Russians left vs but of late<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05351">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. How Madam? Russians?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. I in truth, my Lord.<br>

Trim gallants, full of Courtship and of state<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05352">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. Madam speake true. It is not so my Lord:<br>

My Ladie (to the manner of the daies)<br>

In curtesie giues vndeseruing praise.<br>

We foure indeed confronted were with foure<br>

In Russia habit: Heere they stayed an houre,<br>

And talk'd apace: and in that houre (my Lord)<br>

They did not blesse vs with one happy word.<br>

I dare not call them fooles; but this I thinke,<br>

When they are thirstie, fooles would faine haue drinke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. This iest is drie to me. Gentle sweete,<br>

Your wits makes wise things foolish when we greete<br>

With eies best seeing, heauens fierie eie:<br>

By light we loose light; your capacitie<br>

Is of that nature, that to your huge stoore,<br>

Wise things seeme foolish, and rich things but poore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05354">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. This proues you wise and rich: for in my eie<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. I am a foole, and full of pouertie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05355">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But that you take what doth to you belong,<br>

It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05356"> Ber. O, I am yours, and all that I possesse</p><br>

<p id="id05357"> Ros. All the foole mine</p><br>

<p id="id05358"> Ber. I cannot giue you lesse</p><br>

<p id="id05359">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Which of the Vizards what it that you wore?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Where? when? What Vizard?<br>

Why demand you this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. There, then, that vizard, that superfluous case,<br>

That hid the worse, and shew'd the better face<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. We are discried,<br>

They'l mocke vs now downeright<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05361"> Du. Let vs confesse, and turne it to a iest</p><br>

<p id="id05362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Que. Amaz'd my Lord? Why lookes your Highnes<br>

sadde?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. Helpe hold his browes, hee'l sound: why looke<br>

you pale?<br>

Sea-sicke I thinke comming from Muscouie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05363">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Thus poure the stars down plagues for periury.<br>

Can any face of brasse hold longer out?<br>

Heere stand I, Ladie dart thy skill at me,<br>

Bruise me with scorne, confound me with a flout.<br>

Thrust thy sharpe wit quite through my ignorance.<br>

Cut me to peeces with thy keene conceit:<br>

And I will wish thee neuer more to dance,<br>

Nor neuer more in Russian habit waite.<br>

O! neuer will I trust to speeches pen'd,<br>

Nor to the motion of a Schoole-boies tongue.<br>

Nor neuer come in vizard to my friend,<br>

Nor woo in rime like a blind-harpers songue,<br>

Taffata phrases, silken tearmes precise,<br>

Three-pil'd Hyperboles, spruce affection;<br>

Figures pedanticall, these summer flies,<br>

Haue blowne me full of maggot ostentation.<br>

I do forsweare them, and I heere protest,<br>

By this white Gloue (how white the hand God knows)<br>

Henceforth my woing minde shall be exprest<br>

In russet yeas, and honest kersie noes.<br>

And to begin Wench, so God helpe me law,<br>

My loue to thee is sound, sans cracke or flaw,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. Sans, sans, I pray you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05364">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Yet I haue a tricke<br>

Of the old rage: beare with me, I am sicke.<br>

Ile leaue it by degrees: soft, let vs see,<br>

Write Lord haue mercie on vs, on those three,<br>

They are infected, in their hearts it lies:<br>

They haue the plague, and caught it of your eyes:<br>

These Lords are visited, you are not free:<br>

For the Lords tokens on you do I see<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05365"> Qu. No, they are free that gaue these tokens to vs</p><br>

<p id="id05366"> Ber. Our states are forfeit, seeke not to vndo vs</p><br>

<p id="id05367">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. It is not so; for how can this be true,<br>

That you stand forfeit, being those that sue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05368"> Ber. Peace, for I will not haue to do with you</p><br>

<p id="id05369"> Ros. Nor shall not, if I do as I intend</p><br>

<p id="id05370"> Ber. Speake for your selues, my wit is at an end</p><br>

<p id="id05371">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Teach vs sweete Madame, for our rude transgression,<br>

some faire excuse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05372">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. The fairest is confession.<br>

Were you not heere but euen now, disguis'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Madam, I was<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05373">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. And were you well aduis'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. I was faire Madam<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05374">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. When you then were heere,<br>

What did you whisper in your Ladies eare?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. That more then all the world I did respect her<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. When shee shall challenge this, you will reiect<br>

her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05375"> King. Vpon mine Honor no</p><br>

<p id="id05376">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Peace, peace, forbeare:<br>

Your oath once broke, you force not to forsweare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05377"> King. Despise me when I breake this oath of mine</p><br>

<p id="id05378">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. I will, and therefore keepe it. Rosaline,<br>

What did the Russian whisper in your eare?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Madam, he swore that he did hold me deare<br>

As precious eye-sight, and did value me<br>

Aboue this World: adding thereto moreouer,<br>

That he would Wed me, or else die my Louer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05379">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. God giue thee ioy of him: the Noble Lord<br>

Most honorably doth vphold his word<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. What meane you Madame?<br>

By my life, my troth<br>

I neuer swore this Ladie such an oth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05381">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. By heauen you did; and to confirme it plaine,<br>

You gaue me this: But take it sir againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05382">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. My faith and this, the Princesse I did giue,<br>

I knew her by this Iewell on her sleeue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05383">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Pardon me sir, this Iewell did she weare.<br>

And Lord Berowne (I thanke him) is my deare.<br>

What? Will you haue me, or your Pearle againe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Neither of either, I remit both twaine.<br>

I see the tricke on't: Heere was a consent,<br>

Knowing aforehand of our merriment,<br>

To dash it like a Christmas Comedie.<br>

Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight Zanie,<br>

Some mumble-newes, some trencher-knight, som Dick<br>

That smiles his cheeke in yeares, and knowes the trick<br>

To make my Lady laugh, when she's dispos'd;<br>

Told our intents before: which once disclos'd,<br>

The Ladies did change Fauours; and then we<br>

Following the signes, woo'd but the signe of she.<br>

Now to our periurie, to adde more terror,<br>

We are againe forsworne in will and error.<br>

Much vpon this tis: and might not you<br>

Forestall our sport, to make vs thus vntrue?<br>

Do not you know my Ladies foot by'th squier?<br>

And laugh vpon the apple of her eie?<br>

And stand betweene her backe sir, and the fire,<br>

Holding a trencher, iesting merrilie?<br>

You put our Page out: go, you are alowd.<br>

Die when you will, a smocke shall be your shrowd.<br>

You leere vpon me, do you? There's an eie<br>

Wounds like a Leaden sword<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05384">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy. Full merrily hath this braue manager, this carreere<br>

bene run<br>

<p id="id05385">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Loe, he is tilting straight. Peace, I haue don.<br>

Enter Clowne.<br>

Whether the three worthies shall come in, or no<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05388">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. What, are there but three?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. No sir, but it is vara fine,<br>

For euerie one pursents three<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05389"> Ber. And three times thrice is nine</p><br>

<p id="id05390"> Clo. Not so sir, vnder correction sir, I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg vs sir, I can assure you sir, we know what
we know: I hope sir three times thrice sir</p><br>

<p id="id05391"> Ber. Is not nine</p><br>

<p id="id05392" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Vnder correction sir, wee know where-vntill it
doth amount</p><br>

<p id="id05393"> Ber. By Ioue, I alwaies tooke three threes for nine</p><br>

<p id="id05394" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clow. O Lord sir, it were pittie you should get your
liuing by reckning sir</p><br>

<p id="id05395"> Ber. How much is it?
 Clo. O Lord sir, the parties themselues, the actors sir
will shew where-vntill it doth amount: for mine owne
part, I am (as they say, but to perfect one man in one
poore man) Pompion the great sir</p><br>

<p id="id05396">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Art thou one of the Worthies?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. It pleased them to thinke me worthie of Pompey<br>

the great: for mine owne part, I know not the degree of<br>

the Worthie, but I am to stand for him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05397">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Go, bid them prepare.<br>

Enter.<br>

Let them not approach<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05400"> Ber. We are shame-proofe my Lord: and 'tis some
policie, to haue one shew worse then the Kings and his
companie</p><br>

<p id="id05401"> Kin. I say they shall not come</p><br>

<p id="id05402">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Nay my good Lord, let me ore-rule you now;<br>

That sport best pleases, that doth least know how.<br>

Where Zeale striues to content, and the contents<br>

Dies in the Zeale of that which it presents:<br>

Their forme confounded, makes most forme in mirth,<br>

When great things labouring perish in their birth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05403">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. A right description of our sport my Lord.<br>

Enter Braggart.<br>

<p id="id05404">&nbsp;&nbsp;Brag. Annointed, I implore so much expence of thy<br>

royall sweet breath, as will vtter a brace of words<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05405">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Doth this man serue God?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Why aske you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. He speak's not like a man of God's making<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05406"> Brag. That's all one my faire sweet honie Monarch:
For I protest, the Schoolmaster is exceeding fantasticall:
Too too vaine, too too vaine. But we wil put it (as they
say) to Fortuna delaguar, I wish you the peace of minde
most royall cupplement</p><br>

<p id="id05407"> King. Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies;
He presents Hector of Troy, the Swaine Pompey y great,

the Pedant Iudas Machabeus: and if these foure Worthies
in their first shew thriue, these foure will change
habites, and present the other fiue</p><br>

<p id="id05408"> Ber. There is fiue in the first shew</p><br>

Foole, and the Boy,<br>

Abate throw at Novum, and the whole world againe,<br>

Cannot pricke out fiue such, take each one in's vaine<br>

<p id="id05418"> Du. The great</p><br>

That oft in field, with Targe and Shield,<br>

did make my foe to sweat:<br>

And trauailing along this coast, I heere am come by chance,<br>

And lay my Armes before the legs of this sweet Lasse of<br>

France.<br>

If your Ladiship would say thankes Pompey, I had done<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05420"> La. Great thankes great Pompey</p><br>

Enter Curate for Alexander.<br>

My Scutcheon plaine declares that I am Alisander<br>

For it stands too right<br>

<p id="id05431"> Ber. Take away the Conqueror, take away Alisander
 Clo. O sir, you haue ouerthrowne Alisander the conqueror:
you will be scrap'd out of the painted cloth for
this: your Lion that holds his Pollax sitting on a close
stoole, will be giuen to Aiax. He will be the ninth worthie.
A Conqueror, and affraid to speake? Runne away
for shame Alisander. There an't shall please you: a foolish
milde man, an honest man, looke you, &amp; soon dasht.
He is a maruellous good neighbour insooth, and a verie
good Bowler: but for Alisander, alas you see, how 'tis a
little ore-parted. But there are Worthies a comming,
will speake their minde in some other sort.</p><br>

The liberall opposition of our spirits,<br>

If ouer-boldly we haue borne our selues,<br>

In the conuerse of breath (your gentlenesse<br>

Was guiltie of it.) Farewell worthie Lord:<br>

A heauie heart beares not a humble tongue.<br>

Excuse me so, comming so short of thankes,<br>

For my great suite, so easily obtain'd<br>

All causes to the purpose of his speed:<br>

That, which long processe could not arbitrate.<br>

And though the mourning brow of progenie<br>

Forbid the smiling curtesie of Loue:<br>

The holy suite which faine it would conuince,<br>

Yet since loues argument was first on foote,<br>

Let not the cloud of sorrow iustle it<br>

From what it purpos'd: since to waile friends lost,<br>

Is not by much so wholsome profitable,<br>

As to reioyce at friends but newly found<br>

For your faire sakes haue we neglected time,<br>

Plaid foule play with our oaths: your beautie Ladies<br>

Hath much deformed vs, fashioning our humors<br>

Euen to the opposed end of our intents.<br>

And what in vs hath seem'd ridiculous:<br>

As Loue is full of vnbefitting straines,<br>

All wanton as a childe, skipping and vaine.<br>

Form'd by the eie, and therefore like the eie.<br>

Full of straying shapes, of habits, and of formes<br>

Varying in subiects as the eie doth roule,<br>

To euerie varied obiect in his glance:<br>

Which partie-coated presence of loose loue<br>

Put on by vs, if in your heauenly eies,<br>

Haue misbecom'd our oathes and grauities.<br>

Those heauenlie eies that looke into these faults,<br>

Suggested vs to make: therefore Ladies<br>

Our loue being yours, the error that Loue makes<br>

Is likewise yours. We to our selues proue false,<br>

By being once false, for euer to be true<br>

To those that make vs both, faire Ladies you.<br>

And euen that falshood in it selfe a sinne,<br>

Thus purifies it selfe, and turnes to grace<br>

<p id="id05525">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. We haue receiu'd your Letters, full of Loue:<br>

Your Fauours, the Ambassadors of Loue.<br>

And in our maiden counsaile rated them,<br>

At courtship, pleasant iest, and curtesie,<br>

As bumbast and as lining to the time:<br>

But more deuout then these are our respects<br>

Haue we not bene, and therefore met your loues<br>

In their owne fashion, like a merriment<br>

<p id="id05530">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. A time me thinkes too short,<br>

To make a world-without-end bargaine in:<br>

No, no my Lord, your Grace is periur'd much,<br>

Full of deare guiltinesse, and therefore this:<br>

If for my Loue (as there is no such cause)<br>

You will do ought, this shall you do for me.<br>

Your oth I will not trust: but go with speed<br>

To some forlorne and naked Hermitage,<br>

Remote from all the pleasures of the world:<br>

There stay, vntill the twelue Celestiall Signes<br>

Haue brought about their annuall reckoning.<br>

If this austere insociable life,<br>

Change not your offer made in heate of blood:<br>

If frosts, and fasts, hard lodging, and thin weeds<br>

Nip not the gaudie blossomes of your Loue,<br>

But that it beare this triall, and last loue:<br>

Then at the expiration of the yeare,<br>

Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,<br>

And by this Virgin palme, now kissing thine,<br>

I will be thine: and till that instant shut<br>

My wofull selfe vp in a mourning house,<br>

Raining the teares of lamentation,<br>

For the remembrance of my Fathers death.<br>

If this thou do denie, let our hands part,<br>

Neither intitled in the others hart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05531">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. If this, or more then this, I would denie,<br>

To flatter vp these powers of mine with rest,<br>

The sodaine hand of death close vp mine eie.<br>

Hence euer then, my heart is in thy brest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05532">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. And what to me my Loue? and what to me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd.<br>

You are attaint with faults and periurie:<br>

Therefore if you my fauor meane to get,<br>

A tweluemonth shall you spend, and neuer rest,<br>

But seeke the wearie beds of people sicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05533">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. But what to me my loue? but what to me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. A wife? a beard, faire health, and honestie,<br>

With three-fold loue, I wish you all these three<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05534">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. O shall I say, I thanke you gentle wife?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. Not so my Lord, a tweluemonth and a day,<br>

Ile marke no words that smoothfac'd wooers say.<br>

Come when the King doth to my Ladie come:<br>

Then if I haue much loue, Ile giue you some<br>

<p id="id05535"> Dum. Ile serue thee true and faithfully till then</p><br>

<p id="id05539"> Mari. The liker you, few taller are so yong</p><br>

<p id="id05540">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Studies my Ladie? Mistresse, looke on me,<br>

Behold the window of my heart, mine eie:<br>

What humble suite attends thy answer there,<br>

Impose some seruice on me for my loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05541">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Oft haue I heard of you my Lord Berowne,<br>

Before I saw you: and the worlds large tongue<br>

Proclaimes you for a man repleate with mockes,<br>

Full of comparisons, and wounding floutes:<br>

Which you on all estates will execute,<br>

That lie within the mercie of your wit.<br>

To weed this Wormewood from your fruitfull braine,<br>

And therewithall to win me, if you please,<br>

Without the which I am not to be won:<br>

You shall this tweluemonth terme from day to day,<br>

Visit the speechlesse sicke, and still conuerse<br>

With groaning wretches: and your taske shall be,<br>

With all the fierce endeuour of your wit,<br>

To enforce the pained impotent to smile<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05542">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. To moue wilde laughter in the throate of death?<br>

It cannot be, it is impossible.<br>

Mirth cannot moue a soule in agonie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05543">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,<br>

Whose influence is begot of that loose grace,<br>

Which shallow laughing hearers giue to fooles:<br>

A iests prosperitie, lies in the eare<br>

Of him that heares it, neuer in the tongue<br>

Of him that makes it: then, if sickly eares,<br>

Deaft with the clamors of their owne deare grones,<br>

Will heare your idle scornes; continue then,<br>

And I will haue you, and that fault withall.<br>

But if they will not, throw away that spirit,<br>

And I shal finde you emptie of that fault,<br>

Right ioyfull of your reformation<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05544">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. A tweluemonth? Well: befall what will befall,<br>

<p id="id05579">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.<br>

I know not by what power I am made bold,<br>

Nor how it may concerne my modestie<br>

In such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts:<br>

But I beseech your Grace, that I may know<br>

The worst that may befall me in this case,<br>

If I refuse to wed Demetrius<br>

<p id="id05580">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Either to dye the death, or to abiure<br>

For euer the society of men.<br>

Therefore faire Hermia question your desires,<br>

Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<br>

Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice)<br>

You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne,<br>

For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd,<br>

To liue a barren sister all your life,<br>

Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse Moone,<br>

Thrice blessed they that master so their blood,<br>

To vndergo such maiden pilgrimage,<br>

But earthlier happie is the Rose distil'd,<br>

Then that which withering on the virgin thorne,<br>

Growes, liues, and dies, in single blessednesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05581">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. So will I grow, so liue, so die my Lord,<br>

Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp<br>

Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake,<br>

My soule consents not to giue soueraignty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05582">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon<br>

The sealing day betwixt my loue and me,<br>

For euerlasting bond of fellowship:<br>

Vpon that day either prepare to dye,<br>

For disobedience to your fathers will,<br>

Or else to wed Demetrius as hee would,<br>

Or on Dianaes Altar to protest<br>

For aie, austerity, and single life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05583">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Relent sweet Hermia, and Lysander, yeelde<br>

Thy crazed title to my certaine right<br>

<p id="id05584">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius:<br>

Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05585">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egeus. Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue;<br>

And what is mine, my loue shall render him.<br>

And she is mine, and all my right of her,<br>

I do estate vnto Demetrius<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05586">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he,<br>

As well possest: my loue is more then his:<br>

My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd<br>

(If not with vantage) as Demetrius:<br>

And (which is more then all these boasts can be)<br>

I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia.<br>

Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br>

Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head,<br>

Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena,<br>

And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes,<br>

Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,<br>

Vpon this spotted and inconstant man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05587">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. I must confesse, that I haue heard so much,<br>

And with Demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof:<br>

But being ouer-full of selfe-affaires,<br>

My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come,<br>

And come Egeus, you shall go with me,<br>

I haue some priuate schooling for you both.<br>

For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your selfe,<br>

To fit your fancies to your Fathers will;<br>

Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp<br>

(Which by no meanes we may extenuate)<br>

To death, or to a vow of single life.<br>

Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue?<br>

Demetrius and Egeus go along:<br>

I must imploy you in some businesse<br>

Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you<br>

Of something, neerely that concernes your selues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05588"> Ege. With dutie and desire we follow you.</p><br>

<p id="id05589">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id05590">Manet Lysander and Hermia.</p><br>

How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Belike for want of raine, which I could well<br>

Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05592">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. For ought that euer I could reade,<br>

Could euer heare by tale or historie,<br>

The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,<br>

But either it was different in blood<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05593"> Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue</p><br>

<p id="id05594"> Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares</p><br>

<p id="id05595"> Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong</p><br>

<p id="id05596"> Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit</p><br>

<p id="id05597"> Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie</p><br>

<p id="id05598">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise,<br>

Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;<br>

Making it momentarie, as a sound:<br>

Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,<br>

Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,<br>

That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;<br>

And ere a man hath power to say, behold,<br>

The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp:<br>

So quicke bright things come to confusion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05599">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. If then true Louers haue beene euer crost,<br>

It stands as an edict in destinie:<br>

Then let vs teach our triall patience,<br>

Because it is a customarie crosse,<br>

As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,<br>

Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05600">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia,<br>

I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager,<br>

Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe,<br>

From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues,<br>

And she respects me, as her onely sonne:<br>

There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee,<br>

And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law<br>

Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then<br>

Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night:<br>

And in the wood, a league without the towne,<br>

(Where I did meete thee once with Helena.<br>

To do obseruance for a morne of May)<br>

There will I stay for thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05601">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. My good Lysander,<br>

I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow,<br>

By his best arrow with the golden head,<br>

By the simplicitie of Venus Doues,<br>

By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue,<br>

And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene,<br>

When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene,<br>

By all the vowes that euer men haue broke,<br>

(In number more then euer women spoke)<br>

In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br>

To morrow truly will I meete with thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05602">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena.<br>

Enter Helena.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05603">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. God speede faire Helena, whither away?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay,<br>

Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire!<br>

Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre<br>

More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare,<br>

When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare,<br>

Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so,<br>

Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go,<br>

My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,<br>

My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie,<br>

Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br>

The rest Ile giue to be to you translated.<br>

O teach me how you looke, and with what art<br>

You sway the motion of Demetrius hart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05604"> Her. I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still</p><br>

<p id="id05605" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Hel. O that your frownes would teach my smiles
such skil</p><br>

<p id="id05606"> Her. I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue</p><br>

<p id="id05607"> Hel. O that my prayers could such affection mooue</p><br>

<p id="id05608"> Her. The more I hate, the more he followes me</p><br>

<p id="id05609"> Hel. The more I loue, the more he hateth me</p><br>

<p id="id05610"> Her. His folly Helena is none of mine</p><br>

<p id="id05611">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,<br>

Lysander and my selfe will flie this place.<br>

Before the time I did Lysander see,<br>

Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee.<br>

O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell,<br>

That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05612">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold,<br>

To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br>

Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse,<br>

Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse<br>

(A time that Louers flights doth still conceale)<br>

Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05613">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. And in the wood, where often you and I,<br>

Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,<br>

Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld:<br>

There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete,<br>

And thence from Athens turne away our eyes<br>

To seeke new friends and strange companions,<br>

Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs,<br>

And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius.<br>

Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight,<br>

From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05614">Exit Hermia.</p><br>

<p id="id05615">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,<br>

As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05616">Exit Lysander.</p><br>

<p id="id05617">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hele. How happy some, ore othersome can be?<br>

Through Athens I am thought as faire as she.<br>

But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so:<br>

He will not know, what all, but he doth know,<br>

And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes;<br>

So I, admiring of his qualities:<br>

Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,<br>

Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,<br>

Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,<br>

And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde.<br>

Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:<br>

Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.<br>

And therefore is Loue said to be a childe,<br>

Because in choise he is often beguil'd,<br>

As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;<br>

So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where.<br>

For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne,<br>

He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine.<br>

And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt,<br>

So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt,<br>

I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight:<br>

Then to the wood will he, to morrow night<br>

Pursue her; and for his intelligence,<br>

If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:<br>

But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,<br>

To haue his sight thither, and backe againe.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05618">Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer,
Flute
the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor.</p><br>

<p id="id05619">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. Is all our company heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. You were best to call them generally, man by<br>

man according to the scrip<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05620"> Qui. Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which
is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude
before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding
day at night</p><br>

<p id="id05621"> Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on
to a point</p><br>

<p id="id05622" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Quin. Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy,
and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie</p><br>

<p id="id05623"> Bot. A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a
merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors
by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues</p><br>

<p id="id05624">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quince. Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the<br>

Weauer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05625">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottome. Ready; name what part I am for, and<br>

proceed<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05626"> Quince. You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus</p><br>

<p id="id05627">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for<br>

loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05628"> Bot. That will aske some teares in the true performing
of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies:
I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure.
To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could
play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all
split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break
the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine
from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This
was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This
is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling</p><br>

<p id="id05629"> Quin. Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender</p><br>

<p id="id05630"> Flu. Heere Peter Quince</p><br>

<p id="id05631"> Quin. You must take Thisbie on you</p><br>

<p id="id05632">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flut. What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05633">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flut. Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a<br>

beard comming<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05634">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui. That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and<br>

you may speake as small as you will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05635">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too:<br>

Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah<br>

Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady<br>

deare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05636">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you<br>

Thisby<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05637"> Bot. Well, proceed</p><br>

<p id="id05638"> Qu. Robin Starueling the Taylor</p><br>

<p id="id05639"> Star. Heere Peter Quince</p><br>

<p id="id05640">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quince. Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies<br>

mother?<br>

Tom Snowt, the Tinker<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05641"> Snowt. Heere Peter Quince</p><br>

<p id="id05642"> Quin. you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father;
Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there
is a play fitted</p><br>

<p id="id05643">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snug. Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if<br>

be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05644">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing<br>

but roaring<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05645"> Bot. Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I
will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare,
that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let
him roare againe</p><br>

<p id="id05646"> Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would
fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would
shrike, and that were enough to hang us all</p><br>

<p id="id05647"> All. That would hang vs euery mothers sonne</p><br>

<p id="id05648"> Bottome. I graunt you friends, if that you should
fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would
haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate
my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as
any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale</p><br>

<p id="id05649"> Quin. You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus
is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in
a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore
you must needs play Piramus</p><br>

<p id="id05650">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I<br>

best to play it in?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. Why, what you will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05651"> Bot. I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour
beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine
beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect
yellow</p><br>

<p id="id05652"> Quin. Some of your French Crownes haue no haire
at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here
are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and
desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet
me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by
Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in
the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises
knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties,
such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not</p><br>

<p id="id05653"> Bottom. We will meete, and there we may rehearse
more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect,
adieu</p><br>

<p id="id05654"> Quin. At the Dukes oake we meete</p><br>

<p id="id05655"> Bot. Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.</p><br>

<p id="id05656">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id05657">Actus Secundus.</p><br>

<p id="id05658">Enter a Fairie at one dore, and Robin goodfellow at another.</p><br>

<p id="id05659">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. How now spirit, whether wander you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fai. Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar,<br>

Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire,<br>

I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere;<br>

And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the green.<br>

The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee,<br>

In their gold coats, spots you see,<br>

Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors,<br>

In those freckles, liue their sauors,<br>

I must go seeke some dew drops heere,<br>

And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare.<br>

Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon,<br>

Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05660">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night,<br>

Take heed the Queene come not within his sight,<br>

For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>

Because that she, as her attendant, hath<br>

A louely boy stolne from an Indian King,<br>

She neuer had so sweet a changeling,<br>

And iealous Oberon would haue the childe<br>

Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde.<br>

But she (perforce) with-holds the loued boy,<br>

Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy.<br>

And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene,<br>

By fountaine cleere, or spangled star-light sheene,<br>

But they do square, that all their Elues for feare<br>

Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05661">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fai. Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br>

Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit<br>

Cal'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not hee,<br>

That frights the maidens of the Villagree,<br>

Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne,<br>

And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne,<br>

And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme,<br>

Misleade night-wanderers, laughing at their harme,<br>

Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Pucke,<br>

You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke.<br>

Are not you he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. Thou speak'st aright;<br>

I am that merrie wanderer of the night:<br>

I iest to Oberon, and make him smile,<br>

When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br>

Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale,<br>

And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole,<br>

In very likenesse of a roasted crab:<br>

And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob,<br>

And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale.<br>

The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale,<br>

Sometime for three-foot stoole, mistaketh me,<br>

Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she,<br>

And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe.<br>

And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe,<br>

And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare,<br>

A merrier houre was neuer wasted there.<br>

But roome Fairy, heere comes Oberon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05662">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair. And heere my Mistris:<br>

Would that he were gone.<br>

Enter the King of Fairies at one doore with his traine, and the<br>

Queene at<br>

another with hers.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05663">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Ill met by Moone-light.<br>

Proud Tytania<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05664">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. What, iealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence.<br>

I haue forsworne his bed and companie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05665">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Then I must be thy Lady: but I know<br>

When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land,<br>

And in the shape of Corin, sate all day,<br>

Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue<br>

To amorous Phillida. Why art thou heere<br>

Come from the farthest steepe of India?<br>

But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon<br>

Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue,<br>

To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come,<br>

To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05666">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. How canst thou thus for shame Tytania.<br>

Glance at my credite, with Hippolita?<br>

Knowing I know thy loue to Theseus?<br>

Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night<br>

From Peregenia, whom he rauished?<br>

And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith<br>

With Ariadne, and Antiopa?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Que. These are the forgeries of iealousie,<br>

And neuer since the middle Summers spring<br>

Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead,<br>

By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke,<br>

Or in the beached margent of the sea,<br>

To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,<br>

But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport.<br>

Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine,<br>

As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea<br>

Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land,<br>

Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud,<br>

That they haue ouer-borne their Continents.<br>

The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd his yoake in vaine,<br>

The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne<br>

Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard:<br>

The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<br>

And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke,<br>

The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud,<br>

And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene,<br>

For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable.<br>

The humane mortals want their winter heere,<br>

No night is now with hymne or caroll blest;<br>

Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods)<br>

Pale in her anger, washes all the aire;<br>

That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound.<br>

And through this distemperature, we see<br>

The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts<br>

Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,<br>

And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne,<br>

An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds<br>

Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer,<br>

The childing Autumne, angry Winter change<br>

Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world,<br>

By their increase, now knowes not which is which;<br>

And this same progeny of euills,<br>

Comes from our debate, from our dissention,<br>

We are their parents and originall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05667">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ober. Do you amend it then, it lies in you,<br>

Why should Titania crosse her Oberon?<br>

I do but beg a little changeling boy,<br>

To be my Henchman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05668">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Set your heart at rest,<br>

The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me,<br>

His mother was a Votresse of my Order,<br>

And in the spiced Indian aire, by night<br>

Full often hath she gossipt by my side,<br>

And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands,<br>

Marking th' embarked traders on the flood,<br>

When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue,<br>

And grow big bellied with the wanton winde:<br>

Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,<br>

Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire)<br>

Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land,<br>

To fetch me trifles, and returne againe,<br>

As from a voyage, rich with merchandize.<br>

But she being mortall, of that boy did die,<br>

And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy,<br>

And for her sake I will not part with him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05669">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. How long within this wood intend you stay?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Perchance till after Theseus wedding day.<br>

If you will patiently dance in our Round,<br>

And see our Moone-light reuels, goe with vs;<br>

If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05670"> Ob. Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee</p><br>

<p id="id05671">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away:<br>

We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05672">Exeunt</p><br>

<p id="id05673">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue,<br>

Till I torment thee for this iniury.<br>

My gentle Pucke come hither; thou remembrest<br>

Since once I sat vpon a promontory,<br>

And heard a Meare-maide on a Dolphins backe,<br>

Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,<br>

That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song,<br>

And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares,<br>

To heare the Sea-maids musicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05674"> Puc. I remember</p><br>

<p id="id05675">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. That very time I say (but thou couldst not)<br>

Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth,<br>

Cupid all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke<br>

At a faire Vestall, throned by the West,<br>

And loos'd his loue-shaft smartly from his bow,<br>

As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,<br>

But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft<br>

Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone;<br>

And the imperiall Votresse passed on,<br>

In maiden meditation, fancy free.<br>

Yet markt I where the bolt of Cupid fell.<br>

It fell vpon a little westerne flower;<br>

Before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound,<br>

And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse.<br>

Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once,<br>

The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,<br>

Will make or man or woman madly dote<br>

Vpon the next liue creature that it sees.<br>

Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe,<br>

Ere the Leuiathan can swim a league<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05676"> Pucke. Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes</p><br>

<p id="id05677">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ober. Hauing once this iuyce,<br>

Ile watch Titania, when she is asleepe,<br>

And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:<br>

The next thing when she waking lookes vpon,<br>

(Be it on Lyon, Beare, or Wolfe, or Bull,<br>

On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape)<br>

Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue.<br>

And ere I take this charme off from her sight,<br>

(As I can take it with another hearbe)<br>

Ile make her render vp her Page to me.<br>

But who comes heere? I am inuisible,<br>

And I will ouer-heare their conference.<br>

Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05678">&nbsp;&nbsp;Deme. I loue thee not, therefore pursue me not,<br>

Where is Lysander, and faire Hermia?<br>

The one Ile stay, the other stayeth me.<br>

Thou toldst me they were stolne into this wood;<br>

And heere am I, and wood within this wood,<br>

Because I cannot meet my Hermia.<br>

Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05679">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. You draw me, you hard-hearted Adamant,<br>

But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart<br>

Is true as steele. Leaue you your power to draw,<br>

And I shall haue no power to follow you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05680">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deme. Do I entice you? do I speake you faire?<br>

Or rather doe I not in plainest truth,<br>

Tell you I doe not, nor I cannot loue you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. And euen for that doe I loue thee the more;<br>

I am your spaniell, and Demetrius,<br>

The more you beat me, I will fawne on you.<br>

Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me,<br>

Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue<br>

(Vnworthy as I am) to follow you.<br>

What worser place can I beg in your loue,<br>

(And yet a place of high respect with me)<br>

Then to be vsed as you doe your dogge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05681">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,<br>

For I am sicke when I do looke on thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05682"> Hel. And I am sicke when I looke not on you</p><br>

<p id="id05683">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. You doe impeach your modesty too much,<br>

To leaue the Citty, and commit your selfe<br>

Into the hands of one that loues you not,<br>

To trust the opportunity of night.<br>

And the ill counsell of a desert place,<br>

With the rich worth of your virginity<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05684">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Your vertue is my priuiledge: for that<br>

It is not night when I doe see your face.<br>

Therefore I thinke I am not in the night,<br>

Nor doth this wood lacke worlds of company,<br>

For you in my respect are all the world.<br>

Then how can it be said I am alone,<br>

When all the world is heere to looke on me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Ile run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,<br>

And leaue thee to the mercy of wilde beasts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05685">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. The wildest hath not such a heart as you;<br>

Runne when you will, the story shall be chang'd:<br>

Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;<br>

The Doue pursues the Griffin, the milde Hinde<br>

Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede,<br>

When cowardise pursues, and valour flies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05686">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demet. I will not stay thy questions, let me go;<br>

Or if thou follow me, doe not beleeue,<br>

But I shall doe thee mischiefe in the wood<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05687">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field<br>

You doe me mischiefe. Fye Demetrius,<br>

Your wrongs doe set a scandall on my sexe:<br>

We cannot fight for loue, as men may doe;<br>

We should be woo'd, and were not made to wooe.<br>

I follow thee, and make a heauen of hell,<br>

To die vpon the hand I loue so well.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05688">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leaue this groue,<br>

Thou shalt flie him, and he shall seeke thy loue.<br>

Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer.<br>

Enter Pucke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05689"> Puck. I there it is</p><br>

<p id="id05690">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. I pray thee giue it me.<br>

I know a banke where the wilde time blowes,<br>

Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet growes,<br>

Quite ouer-cannoped with luscious woodbine,<br>

With sweet muske roses, and with Eglantine;<br>

There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night,<br>

Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight:<br>

And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne,<br>

Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in.<br>

And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes,<br>

And make her full of hatefull fantasies.<br>

Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue;<br>

A sweet Athenian Lady is in loue<br>

With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes,<br>

But doe it when the next thing he espies,<br>

May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man,<br>

By the Athenian garments he hath on.<br>

Effect it with some care, that he may proue<br>

More fond on her, then she vpon her loue;<br>

And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05691">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pu. Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so.<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id05692">Enter Queene of Fairies, with her traine.</p><br>

<p id="id05693">&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen. Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song;<br>

Then for the third part of a minute hence,<br>

Some to kill Cankers in the muske rose buds,<br>

Some warre with Reremise, for their leathern wings.<br>

To make my small Elues coates, and some keepe backe<br>

The clamorous Owle that nightly hoots and wonders<br>

At our queint spirits: Sing me now asleepe,<br>

Then to your offices, and let me rest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05694">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairies Sing. You spotted Snakes with double tongue,<br>

Thorny Hedgehogges be not seene,<br>

Newts and blinde wormes do no wrong,<br>

Come not neere our Fairy Queene.<br>

Philomele with melodie,<br>

Sing in your sweet Lullaby.<br>

Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby,<br>

Neuer harme, nor spell, nor charme,<br>

So good night with Lullaby<br>

<p id="id05697">Shee sleepes.</p><br>

<p id="id05699">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ober. What thou seest when thou dost wake,<br>

Do it for thy true Loue take:<br>

Loue and languish for his sake.<br>

Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare,<br>

Pard, or Boare with bristled haire,<br>

In thy eye that shall appeare,<br>

When thou wak'st, it is thy deare,<br>

Wake when some vile thing is neere.<br>

Enter Lisander and Hermia.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05700">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lis. Faire loue, you faint with wandring in y woods,<br>

And to speake troth I haue forgot our way:<br>

Wee'll rest vs Hermia, If you thinke it good,<br>

And tarry for the comfort of the day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05701">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Be it so Lysander; finde you out a bed,<br>

For I vpon this banke will rest my head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05702">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both,<br>

One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05703">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Nay good Lysander, for my sake my deere<br>

Lie further off yet, doe not lie so neere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05704">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. O take the sence sweet, of my innocence,<br>

Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference,<br>

I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit,<br>

So that but one heart can you make of it.<br>

Two bosomes interchanged with an oath,<br>

So then two bosomes, and a single troth.<br>

Then by your side, no bed-roome me deny,<br>

For lying so, Hermia, I doe not lye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05705">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Lysander riddles very prettily;<br>

Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,<br>

If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied.<br>

But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie<br>

Lie further off, in humane modesty,<br>

Such separation, as may well be said,<br>

Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide,<br>

So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend;<br>

Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05706">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I,<br>

And then end life, when I end loyalty:<br>

Heere is my bed, sleepe giue thee all his rest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05707">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. With halfe that wish, the wishers eyes be prest.<br>

Enter Pucke. They sleepe.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05708">&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. Through the Forest haue I gone,<br>

But Athenian finde I none,<br>

One whose eyes I might approue<br>

This flowers force in stirring loue.<br>

Nigh and silence: who is heere?<br>

Weedes of Athens he doth weare:<br>

This is he (my master said)<br>

Despised the Athenian maide:<br>

And heere the maiden sleeping sound,<br>

On the danke and durty ground.<br>

Pretty soule, she durst not lye<br>

Neere this lacke-loue, this kill-curtesie.<br>

Churle, vpon thy eyes I throw<br>

All the power this charme doth owe:<br>

When thou wak'st, let loue forbid<br>

Sleepe his seate on thy eye-lid.<br>

So awake when I am gone:<br>

For I must now to Oberon.<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id05714">Exit Demetrius.</p><br>

<p id="id05715">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. O I am out of breath, in this fond chace,<br>

The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace,<br>

Happy is Hermia, wheresoere she lies;<br>

For she hath blessed and attractiue eyes.<br>

How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt teares.<br>

If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers.<br>

No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare;<br>

For beasts that meete me, runne away for feare,<br>

Therefore no maruaile, though Demetrius<br>

Doe as a monster, flie my presence thus.<br>

What wicked and dissembling glasse of mine,<br>

Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne?<br>

But who is here? Lysander on the ground;<br>

Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound,<br>

Lysander, if you liue, good sir awake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05716">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.<br>

Transparent Helena, nature her shewes art,<br>

That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart.<br>

Where is Demetrius? oh how fit a word<br>

Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Do not say so Lysander, say not so:<br>

What though he loue your Hermia? Lord, what though?<br>

Yet Hermia still loues you; then be content<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05717">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Content with Hermia? no, I do repent<br>

The tedious minutes I with her haue spent.<br>

Not Hermia, but Helena now I loue;<br>

Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue?<br>

The will of man is by his reason sway'd:<br>

And reason saies you are the worthier Maide.<br>

Things growing are not ripe vntill their season;<br>

So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason,<br>

And touching now the point of humane skill,<br>

Reason becomes the Marshall to my will.<br>

And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke<br>

Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05718">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Wherefore was I to this keene mockery borne?<br>

When at your hands did I deserue this scorne?<br>

Ist not enough, ist not enough, yong man,<br>

That I did neuer, no nor neuer can,<br>

Deserue a sweete looke from Demetrius eye,<br>

But you must flout my insufficiency?<br>

Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do)<br>

In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe.<br>

But fare you well; perforce I must confesse,<br>

I thought you Lord of more true gentlenesse.<br>

Oh, that a Lady of one man refus'd,<br>

Should of another therefore be abus'd.<br>

Enter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05719">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. She sees not Hermia: Hermia sleepe thou there,<br>

And neuer maist thou come Lysander neere;<br>

For as a surfeit of the sweetest things<br>

The deepest loathing to the stomacke brings:<br>

Or as the heresies that men do leaue,<br>

Are hated most of those that did deceiue:<br>

So thou, my surfeit, and my heresie,<br>

Of all be hated; but the most of me;<br>

And all my powers addresse your loue and might,<br>

To honour Helen, and to be her Knight.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05720">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Helpe me Lysander, helpe me; do thy best<br>

To plucke this crawling serpent from my brest.<br>

Aye me, for pitty; what a dreame was here?<br>

Lysander looke, how I do quake with feare:<br>

Me-thought a serpent eate my heart away,<br>

And yet sat smiling at his cruell prey.<br>

Lysander, What remoou'd? Lysander, Lord,<br>

What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?<br>

Alacke where are you? speake and if you heare:<br>

Speake of all loues; I sound almost with feare.<br>

No, then I well perceiue you are not nye,<br>

Either death or you Ile finde immediately.<br>

<p id="id05721" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Tertius.</p><br>

<p id="id05722">Enter the Clownes.</p><br>

<p id="id05723"> Bot. Are we all met?
 Quin. Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient
place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our
stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will
do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke</p><br>

<p id="id05724">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. Peter Quince?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter. What saist thou, bully Bottome?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and<br>

Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a<br>

sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide.<br>

How answere you that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Snout. Berlaken, a parlous feare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05725">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star. I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when<br>

all is done<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05726"> Bot. Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well.
Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say,
we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus
is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance,
tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the
Weauer; this will put them out of feare</p><br>

<p id="id05727">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall<br>

be written in eight and sixe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05728">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. No, make it two more, let it be written in eight<br>

and eight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05729">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snout. Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Star. I feare it, I promise you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05730"> Bot. Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to
bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most
dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde
foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke
to it</p><br>

<p id="id05731" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Snout. Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not
a Lyon</p><br>

<p id="id05732"> Bot. Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face
must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe
must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect;
Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would
request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to
tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither
as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such
thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let
him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the
ioyner</p><br>

<p id="id05733"> Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard
things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber:
for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight</p><br>

<p id="id05734">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sn. Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our<br>

play?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack,<br>

finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine.<br>

Enter Pucke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05735"> Quin. Yes, it doth shine that night</p><br>

<p id="id05736"> Bot. Why then may you leaue a casement of the great
chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone
may shine in at the casement</p><br>

<p id="id05737"> Quin. I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present
the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another
thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus
and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the
chinke of a wall</p><br>

<p id="id05738"> Sn. You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you
Bottome?
 Bot. Some man or other must present wall, and let
him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough
cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers
thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and
Thisby whisper</p><br>

<p id="id05739"> Quin. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts.
Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech,
enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his
cue.
Enter Robin.</p><br>

<p id="id05740">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. What hempen home-spuns haue we swaggering<br>

here,<br>

So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene?<br>

What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor,<br>

An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05741"> Quin. Speake Piramus: Thisby stand forth</p><br>

<p id="id05742"> Pir. Thisby, the flowers of odious sauors sweete</p><br>

<p id="id05743"> Quin. Odours, odours</p><br>

<p id="id05744">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pir. Odours sauors sweete,<br>

So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby deare.<br>

But harke, a voyce: stay thou but here a while,<br>

And by and by I will to thee appeare.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05745">Exit. Pir.</p><br>

<p id="id05746"> Puck. A stranger Piramus, then ere plaid here</p><br>

<p id="id05747">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. Must I speake now?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. I marry must you. For you must vnderstand he<br>

goes but to see a noyse that he heard, and is to come againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05748">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thys. Most radiant Piramus, most Lilly white of hue,<br>

Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer,<br>

Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew,<br>

As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre,<br>

Ile meete thee Piramus, at Ninnies toombe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05749"> Pet. Ninus toombe man: why, you must not speake

Through bogge, through bush, through brake, through bryer,<br>

Sometime a horse Ile be, sometime a hound:<br>

A hogge, a headlesse beare, sometime a fire,<br>

And neigh, and barke, and grunt, and rore, and burne,<br>

Like horse, hound, hog, beare, fire, at euery turne.<br>

them to make me afeard.
Enter Snowt</p><br>

<p id="id05756">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sn. O Bottom, thou art chang'd; What doe I see on<br>

thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. What do you see? You see an Asse-head of your<br>

Enter Peter Quince.<br>

<p id="id05757">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Blesse thee Bottome, blesse thee; thou art translated.<br>

<p id="id05758"> Bot. I see their knauery; this is to make an asse of me,
to fright me if they could; but I will not stirre from

And dares not answere, nay.<br>

For indeede, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?<br>

Who would giue a bird the lye, though he cry Cuckow,<br>

neuer so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyta. I pray thee gentle mortall, sing againe,<br>

Mine eare is much enamored of thy note;<br>

On the first view to say, to sweare I loue thee.<br>

So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.<br>

And thy faire vertues force (perforce) doth moue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05760"> Bot. Me-thinkes mistresse, you should haue little
reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and
loue keepe little company together, nowadayes.
The more the pittie, that some honest neighbours will
not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke vpon occasion</p><br>

<p id="id05761"> Tyta. Thou art as wise, as thou art beautifull</p><br>

Hop in his walkes, and gambole in his eies,<br>

Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries,<br>

With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries,<br>

The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees,<br>

And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighes,<br>

And light them at the fierie-Glow-wormes eyes,<br>

To haue my loue to bed, and to arise:<br>

And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies,<br>

To fan the Moone-beames from his sleeping eies.<br>

Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies<br>

<p id="id05775">Enter King of Pharies, solus.</p><br>

<p id="id05776">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. I wonder if Titania be awak't;<br>

Then what it was that next came in her eye,<br>

Which she must dote on, in extremitie.<br>

Enter Pucke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05777">Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,<br>

What night-rule now about this haunted groue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. My Mistris with a monster is in loue,<br>

Neere to her close and consecrated bower,<br>

While she was in her dull and sleeping hower,<br>

A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals,<br>

That worke for bread vpon Athenian stals,<br>

Were met together to rehearse a Play,<br>

Intended for great Theseus nuptiall day:<br>

The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,<br>

Who Piramus presented, in their sport,<br>

Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake,<br>

When I did him at this aduantage take,<br>

An Asses nole I fixed on his head.<br>

Anon his Thisbie must be answered,<br>

And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie,<br>

As Wilde-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye,<br>

Or russed-pated choughes, many in sort<br>

(Rising and cawing at the guns report)<br>

Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye:<br>

So at his sight, away his fellowes flye,<br>

And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals;<br>

He murther cries, and helpe from Athens cals.<br>

Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong,<br>

Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong.<br>

For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch,<br>

Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch,<br>

I led them on in this distracted feare,<br>

And left sweete Piramus translated there:<br>

When in that moment (so it came to passe)<br>

Tytania waked, and straightway lou'd an Asse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05778">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. This fals out better then I could deuise:<br>

But hast thou yet lacht the Athenians eyes,<br>

With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. I tooke him sleeping (that is finisht to)<br>

And the Athenian woman by his side,<br>

That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde.<br>

Enter Demetrius and Hermia.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05779"> Ob. Stand close, this is the same Athenian</p><br>

<p id="id05780"> Rob. This is the woman, but not this the man</p><br>

<p id="id05781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. O why rebuke you him that loues you so?<br>

Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse.<br>

For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse,<br>

If thou hast slaine Lysander in his sleepe,<br>

Being oreshooes in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill<br>

me too:<br>

The Sunne was not so true vnto the day,<br>

As he to me. Would he haue stollen away,<br>

From sleeping Hermia? Ile beleeue as soone<br>

This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone<br>

May through the Center creepe, and so displease<br>

Her brothers noonetide, with th'Antipodes.<br>

It cannot be but thou hast murdred him,<br>

So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05783">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. So should the murderer looke, and so should I,<br>

Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty:<br>

Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare,<br>

As yonder Venus in her glimmering spheare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05784">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. What's this to my Lysander? where is he?<br>

Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou giue him me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05785">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds<br>

Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then?<br>

Henceforth be neuer numbred among men.<br>

Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake,<br>

Durst thou a lookt vpon him, being awake?<br>

And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch:<br>

Could not a worme, an Adder do so much?<br>

An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue<br>

Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05786">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood,<br>

I am not guiltie of Lysanders blood:<br>

Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05787"> Her. I pray thee tell me then that he is well</p><br>

<p id="id05788">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. And if I could, what should I get therefore?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. A priuiledge, neuer to see me more;<br>

And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more<br>

Whether he be dead or no.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05789">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. There is no following her in this fierce vaine,<br>

Here therefore for a while I will remaine.<br>

So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow:<br>

For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe,<br>

Which now in some slight measure it will pay,<br>

If for his tender here I make some stay.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05790">Lie downe.</p><br>

<p id="id05791">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite<br>

And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight:<br>

Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue<br>

Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05792">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth,<br>

A million faile, confounding oath on oath<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05793">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. About the wood, goe swifter then the winde,<br>

And Helena of Athens looke thou finde.<br>

All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere,<br>

With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare.<br>

By some illusion see thou bring her heere,<br>

Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05794">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin. I go, I go, looke how I goe,<br>

Swifter then arrow from the Tartars bowe.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05795">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Flower of this purple die,<br>

Hit with Cupids archery,<br>

Sinke in apple of his eye,<br>

When his loue he doth espie,<br>

Let her shine as gloriously<br>

As the Venus of the sky.<br>

When thou wak'st if she be by,<br>

Beg of her for remedy.<br>

Enter Pucke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05796">&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. Captaine of our Fairy band,<br>

Helena is heere at hand,<br>

And the youth, mistooke by me,<br>

Pleading for a Louers fee.<br>

Shall we their fond Pageant see?<br>

Lord, what fooles these mortals be!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Stand aside: the noyse they make,<br>

Will cause Demetrius to awake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05797">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. Then will two at once wooe one,<br>

That must needs be sport alone:<br>

And those things doe best please me,<br>

That befall preposterously.<br>

Enter Lysander and Helena.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05798">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn?<br>

Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares:<br>

Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne,<br>

In their natiuity all truth appeares.<br>

How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you?<br>

Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05799">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. You doe aduance your cunning more &amp; more,<br>

When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray!<br>

These vowes are Hermias. Will you giue her ore?<br>

Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.<br>

Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales)<br>

Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05800"> Lys. I had no iudgement, when to her I swore</p><br>

<p id="id05801"> Hel. Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore</p><br>

<p id="id05802"> Lys. Demetrius loues her, and he loues not you.</p><br>

<p id="id05803">Awa.</p><br>

<p id="id05804">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. O Helen, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine,<br>

To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne!<br>

Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show,<br>

Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!<br>

That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,<br>

Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow,<br>

When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse<br>

This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05805">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. O spight! O hell! I see you are all bent<br>

To set against me, for your merriment:<br>

If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie,<br>

You would not doe me thus much iniury.<br>

Can you not hate me, as I know you doe,<br>

But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me to?<br>

If you are men, as men you are in show,<br>

You would not vse a gentle Lady so;<br>

To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts,<br>

When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<br>

You both are Riuals, and loue Hermia;<br>

And now both Riuals to mocke Helena.<br>

A trim exploit, a manly enterprize,<br>

To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes,<br>

With your derision; none of noble sort,<br>

Would so offend a Virgin, and extort<br>

A poore soules patience, all to make you sport,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysa. You are vnkind Demetrius; be not so,<br>

For you loue Hermia; this you know I know;<br>

And here with all good will, with all my heart,<br>

In Hermias loue I yeeld you vp my part;<br>

And yours of Helena, To me bequeath,<br>

Whom I do loue, and will do to my death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05806"> Hel. Neuer did mockers wast more idle breth</p><br>

<p id="id05807">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none:<br>

If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone.<br>

My heart to her, but as guest-wise soiourn'd,<br>

And now to Helen it is home return'd,<br>

There to remaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05808"> Lys. It is not so</p><br>

<p id="id05809">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;De. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,<br>

Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare.<br>

Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare.<br>

Enter Hermia.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05810">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,<br>

The eare more quicke of apprehension makes,<br>

Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense,<br>

It paies the hearing double recompence.<br>

Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found,<br>

Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound.<br>

But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysan. Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. What loue could presse Lysander from my side?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide)<br>

Faire Helena; who more engilds the night,<br>

Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light.<br>

Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,<br>

The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05811">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Loe, she is one of this confederacy,<br>

Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three,<br>

To fashion this false sport in spight of me.<br>

Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid,<br>

Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd<br>

To baite me, with this foule derision?<br>

Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd,<br>

The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent,<br>

When wee haue chid the hasty footed time,<br>

For parting vs; O, is all forgot?<br>

All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence?<br>

We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods,<br>

Haue with our needles, created both one flower,<br>

Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br>

Both warbling of one song, both in one key:<br>

As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes<br>

Had beene incorporate. So we grew together,<br>

Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br>

But yet a vnion in partition,<br>

Two louely berries molded on one stem,<br>

So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,<br>

Two of the first life coats in Heraldry,<br>

Due but to one and crowned with one crest.<br>

And will you rent our ancient loue asunder,<br>

To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend?<br>

It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.<br>

Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it,<br>

Though I alone doe feele the iniurie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. I am amazed at your passionate words,<br>

I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne<br>

To follow me, and praise my eies and face?<br>

And made your other loue, Demetrius<br>

(Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote)<br>

To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare,<br>

Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this<br>

To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander<br>

Denie your loue (so rich within his soule)<br>

And tender me (forsooth) affection,<br>

But by your setting on, by your consent?<br>

What though I be not so in grace as you,<br>

So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate?<br>

(But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd)<br>

This you should pittie, rather then despise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05814"> Her. I vnderstand not what you meane by this</p><br>

<p id="id05815">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes,<br>

Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe,<br>

Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp:<br>

This sport well carried, shall be chronicled.<br>

If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners,<br>

You would not make me such an argument:<br>

But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault,<br>

Which death or absence soone shall remedie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05816">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Stay gentle Helena, heare my excuse,<br>

My loue, my life, my soule, faire Helena<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. O excellent!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Sweete, do not scorne her so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05818"> Dem. If she cannot entreate, I can compell</p><br>

<p id="id05819">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate.<br>

Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise.<br>

Helen, I loue thee, by my life I doe;<br>

I sweare by that which I will lose for thee,<br>

To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05820"> Dem. I say, I loue thee more then he can do</p><br>

<p id="id05821"> Lys. If thou say so, withdraw and proue it too</p><br>

<p id="id05822"> Dem. Quick, come</p><br>

<p id="id05823">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Lysander, whereto tends all this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Away, you Ethiope<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05824">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose;<br>

Take on as you would follow,<br>

But yet come not: you are a tame man, go<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05825">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose,<br>

Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05826">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Why are you growne so rude?<br>

What change is this sweete Loue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Thy loue? out tawny Tartar, out;<br>

Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05827">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Do you not iest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Yes sooth, and so do you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05828"> Lys. Demetrius: I will keepe my word with thee</p><br>

<p id="id05829">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. I would I had your bond: for I perceiue<br>

A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05830">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?<br>

Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05831">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. What, can you do me greater harme then hate?<br>

Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue?<br>

Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?<br>

I am as faire now, as I was ere while.<br>

Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me.<br>

Why then you left me (O the gods forbid)<br>

In earnest, shall I say?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. I, by my life;<br>

And neuer did desire to see thee more.<br>

Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;<br>

Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest,<br>

That I do hate thee, and loue Helena<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05832">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. O me, you iugler, you canker blossome,<br>

You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night,<br>

And stolne my loues heart from him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Fine yfaith:<br>

Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame,<br>

No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare<br>

Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<br>

Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05833">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game.<br>

Now I perceiue that she hath made compare<br>

Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height,<br>

And with her personage, her tall personage,<br>

Her height (forsooth) she hath preuail'd with him.<br>

And are you growne so high in his esteeme,<br>

Because I am so dwarfish, and so low?<br>

How low am I, thou painted May-pole? Speake,<br>

How low am I? I am not yet so low,<br>

But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05834">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen,<br>

Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst:<br>

I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse;<br>

I am a right maide for my cowardize;<br>

Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke,<br>

Because she is something lower then my selfe,<br>

That I can match her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05835"> Her. Lower? harke againe</p><br>

<p id="id05836">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me,<br>

I euermore did loue you Hermia,<br>

Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you,<br>

Saue that in loue vnto Demetrius,<br>

I told him of your stealth vnto this wood.<br>

He followed you, for loue I followed him,<br>

But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me<br>

To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too;<br>

And now, so you will let me quiet go,<br>

To Athens will I beare my folly backe,<br>

And follow you no further. Let me go.<br>

You see how simple, and how fond I am<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05837">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05838">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. What, with Lysander?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. With Demetrius<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05839"> Lys. Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee Helena</p><br>

<p id="id05840"> Dem. No sir, she shall not, though you take her part</p><br>

<p id="id05841">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd,<br>

She was a vixen when she went to schoole,<br>

And though she be but little, she is fierce<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05842">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Little againe? Nothing but low and little?<br>

Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?<br>

Let me come to her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05843">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Get you gone you dwarfe,<br>

You minimus, of hindring knot-grasse made,<br>

You bead, you acorne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05844">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. You are too officious,<br>

In her behalfe that scornes your seruices.<br>

Let her alone, speake not of Helena,<br>

Take not her part. For if thou dost intend<br>

Neuer so little shew of loue to her,<br>

Thou shalt abide it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05845">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Now she holds me not,<br>

Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right,<br>

Of thine or mine is most in Helena<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05846">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by<br>

iowle.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05847">Exit Lysander and Demetrius.</p><br>

<p id="id05848">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you.<br>

Nay, goe not backe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05849">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I will not trust you I,<br>

Nor longer stay in your curst companie.<br>

Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray,<br>

My legs are longer though to runne away.<br>

Enter Oberon and Pucke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05850">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st,<br>

Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05851">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke,<br>

Did not you tell me, I should know the man,<br>

By the Athenian garments he hath on?<br>

And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize,<br>

That I haue nointed an Athenians eies,<br>

And so farre am I glad, it so did sort,<br>

As this their iangling I esteeme a sport<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05852">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight,<br>

Hie therefore Robin, ouercast the night,<br>

The starrie Welkin couer thou anon,<br>

With drooping fogge as blacke as Acheron,<br>

And lead these testie Riuals so astray,<br>

As one come not within anothers way.<br>

Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue,<br>

Then stirre Demetrius vp with bitter wrong;<br>

And sometime raile thou like Demetrius;<br>

And from each other looke thou leade them thus,<br>

Till ore their browes, death-counterfeiting, sleepe<br>

With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creepe:<br>

Then crush this hearbe into Lysanders eie,<br>

Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie,<br>

To take from thence all error, with his might,<br>

and make his eie-bals role with wonted sight.<br>

When they next wake, all this derision<br>

Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision,<br>

And backe to Athens shall the Louers wend<br>

With league, whose date till death shall neuer end.<br>

Whiles I in this affaire do thee imploy,<br>

Ile to my Queene, and beg her Indian Boy;<br>

And then I will her charmed eie release<br>

From monsters view, and all things shall be peace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05853">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. My Fairie Lord, this must be done with haste,<br>

For night-swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast,<br>

And yonder shines Auroras harbinger;<br>

At whose approach Ghosts wandring here and there,<br>

Troope home to Church-yards; damned spirits all,<br>

That in crosse-waies and flouds haue buriall,<br>

Alreadie to their wormie beds are gone;<br>

For feare least day should looke their shames vpon,<br>

They wilfully themselues exile from light,<br>

And must for aye consort with blacke browd night<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05854">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. But we are spirits of another sort:<br>

I, with the mornings loue haue oft made sport,<br>

And like a Forrester, the groues may tread,<br>

Euen till the Easterne gate all fierie red,<br>

Opening on Neptune, With faire blessed beames,<br>

Turnes into yellow gold, his salt greene streames.<br>

But not withstanding haste, make no delay:<br>

We may effect this businesse, yet ere day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05855">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puck. Vp and downe, vp and downe, I will leade<br>

them vp and downe: I am fear'd in field and towne.<br>

Goblin, lead them vp and downe: here comes one.<br>

Enter Lysander.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05856">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Where art thou, proud Demetrius?<br>

Speake thou now<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05857">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. Here villaine, drawne &amp; readie. Where art thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. I will be with thee straight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05858">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. Follow me then to plainer ground.<br>

Enter Demetrius.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05859">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Lysander, speake againe;<br>

Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?<br>

Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,<br>

Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,<br>

And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe,<br>

Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd<br>

That drawes a sword on thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05860">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Yea, art thou there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ro. Follow my voice, we'l try no manhood here.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05861">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. He goes before me, and still dares me on,<br>

When I come where he cals, then he's gone.<br>

The Villaine is much lighter heel'd then I:<br>

I followed fast, but faster he did flye;<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05862">shifting places.</p><br>

<p id="id05863">That fallen am I in darke vneuen way,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot,<br>

Thou runst before me, shifting euery place,<br>

And dar'st not stand, nor looke me in the face.<br>

Where art thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. Come hither, I am here<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05867">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this<br>

If euer I thy face by day-light see.<br>

Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me,<br>

To measure out my length on this cold bed,<br>

By daies approach looke to be visited.<br>

Enter Helena.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05868">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. O weary night, O long and tedious night,<br>

Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East,<br>

That I may backe to Athens by day-light,<br>

From these that my poore companie detest;<br>

And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie,<br>

<p id="id05892">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ob. Welcome good Robin:<br>

Seest thou this sweet sight?<br>

Her dotage now I doe begin to pitty.<br>

For meeting her of late behinde the wood,<br>

Seeking sweet sauours for this hatefull foole,<br>

I did vpbraid her, and fall out with her.<br>

For she his hairy temples then had rounded,<br>

With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.<br>

And that same dew which somtime on the buds,<br>

Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles;<br>

Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes,<br>

Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile.<br>

When I had at my pleasure taunted her,<br>

And she in milde termes beg'd my patience,<br>

I then did aske of her, her changeling childe,<br>

Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent<br>

To beare him to my Bower in Fairy Land.<br>

And now I haue the Boy, I will vndoe<br>

This hatefull imperfection of her eyes.<br>

And gentle Pucke, take this transformed scalpe,<br>

From off the head of this Athenian swaine;<br>

That he awaking when the other doe,<br>

May all to Athens backe againe repaire,<br>

And thinke no more of this nights accidents,<br>

But as the fierce vexation of dreame.<br>

But first I will release the Fairy Queene.<br>

Be thou as thou wast wont to be;<br>

See as thou wast wont to see.<br>

Dians bud, or Cupids flower,<br>

Hath such force and blessed power.<br>

Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!<br>

Swifter then the wandering Moone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05901">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tita. Come my Lord, and in our flight,<br>

Tell me how it came this night,<br>

That I sleeping heere was found,<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05902">Sleepers Lye still.</p><br>

<p id="id05903">With these mortals on the ground.</p><br>

<p id="id05904">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id05906">Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and all his traine.</p><br>

<p id="id05907">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. Goe one of you, finde out the Forrester,<br>

For now our obseruation is perform'd;<br>

And since we haue the vaward of the day,<br>

My Loue shall heare the musicke of my hounds.<br>

Vncouple in the Westerne valley, let them goe;<br>

Dispatch I say, and finde the Forrester.<br>

We will faire Queene, vp to the Mountains top,<br>

And marke the musicall confusion<br>

Of hounds and eccho in coniunction<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05908">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once.<br>

When in a wood of Creete they bayed the Beare<br>

With hounds of Sparta; neuer did I heare<br>

Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues,<br>

The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere,<br>

Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard<br>

So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05909">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kinde,<br>

So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung<br>

With eares that sweepe away the morning dew,<br>

Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls,<br>

Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels,<br>

Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable<br>

Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd with horne,<br>

In Creete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly;<br>

Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Egeus. My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe,<br>

And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,<br>

This Helena, olde Nedars Helena,<br>

I wonder of this being heere together<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05910">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. No doubt they rose vp early, to obserue<br>

The right of May; and hearing our intent,<br>

Came heere in grace of our solemnity.<br>

But speake Egeus, is not this the day<br>

That Hermia should giue answer of her choice?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Egeus. It is, my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05911">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. Goe bid the hunts-men wake them with their<br>

hornes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05912">Hornes and they wake.</p><br>

<p id="id05913">Shout within, they all start vp.</p><br>

<p id="id05914">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. Good morrow friends: Saint Valentine is past,<br>

Begin these wood birds but to couple now?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. Pardon my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05915">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. I pray you all stand vp.<br>

I know you two are Riuall enemies.<br>

How comes this gentle concord in the world,<br>

That hatred is so farre from iealousie,<br>

To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05916">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,<br>

Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare,<br>

I cannot truly say how I came heere.<br>

But as I thinke (for truly would I speake)<br>

And now I doe bethinke me, so it is;<br>

I came with Hermia hither. Our intent<br>

Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be<br>

Without the perill of the Athenian Law<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05917">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ege. Enough, enough, my Lord: you haue enough;<br>

I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head:<br>

They would have stolne away, they would Demetrius,<br>

Thereby to haue defeated you and me:<br>

You of your wife, and me of my consent;<br>

Of my consent, that she should be your wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05918">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. My Lord, faire Helen told me of their stealth,<br>

Of this their purpose hither, to this wood,<br>

And I in furie hither followed them;<br>

Faire Helena, in fancy followed me.<br>

But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power,<br>

(But by some power it is) my loue<br>

To Hermia (melted as the snow)<br>

Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,<br>

Which in my childehood I did doat vpon:<br>

And all the faith, the vertue of my heart,<br>

The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye,<br>

Is onely Helena. To her, my Lord,<br>

Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia,<br>

But like a sickenesse did I loath this food,<br>

But as in health, come to my naturall taste,<br>

Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it,<br>

And will for euermore be true to it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05919">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. Faire Louers, you are fortunately met;<br>

Of this discourse we shall heare more anon.<br>

Egeus, I will ouer-beare your will;<br>

For in the Temple, by and by with vs,<br>

These couples shall eternally be knit.<br>

And for the morning now is something worne,<br>

Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.<br>

Away, with vs to Athens; three and three,<br>

Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie.<br>

Come Hippolita.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05920">Exit Duke and Lords.</p><br>

<p id="id05921">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. These things seeme small &amp; vndistinguishable,<br>

Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05922">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye,<br>

When euery thing seemes double<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05923">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. So me-thinkes:<br>

And I haue found Demetrius, like a iewell,<br>

Mine owne, and not mine owne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05924">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. It seemes to mee,<br>

That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke,<br>

The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Yea, and my Father<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05925"> Hel. And Hippolita</p><br>

<p id="id05930"> Clo. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
My next is, most faire Piramus. Hey ho. Peter Quince?
Flute the bellowes-mender? Snout the tinker? Starueling?
Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I
haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit
of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse,
if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I
was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was,
and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole,
if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of
man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans
hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his
heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter
Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called
Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will
sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture,
to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it
at her death.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id05931">Enter Quince, Flute, Thisbie, Snout, and Starueling.</p><br>

<p id="id05932">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. Haue you sent to Bottomes house? Is he come<br>

home yet?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Staru. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is<br>

transported<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05933">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes<br>

not forward, doth it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. It is not possible: you haue not a man in all<br>

Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05934">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handycraft<br>

man in Athens<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05935">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very<br>

Paramour, for a sweet voyce<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05936"> This. You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God
blesse vs) a thing of nought.
Enter Snug the Ioyner.</p><br>

<p id="id05937"> Snug. Masters, the Duke is comming from the Temple,
and there is two or three Lords &amp; Ladies more married.
If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made
men</p><br>

<p id="id05938"> This. O sweet bully Bottome: thus hath he lost sixepence
a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped sixpence
a day. And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence
a day for playing Piramus, Ile be hang'd. He would haue
deserued it. Sixpence a day in Piramus, or nothing.
Enter Bottome.</p><br>

<p id="id05939">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin. Bottome, o most couragious day! O most happie<br>

houre!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me<br>

not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I<br>

will tell you euery thing as it fell out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05940"> Qu. Let vs heare, sweet Bottome</p><br>

<p id="id05941"> Bot. Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that
the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good
strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps,
meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his
part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred:
In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him
that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for they shall hang
out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate
no Onions, nor Garlicke; for wee are to vtter sweete
breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a
sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away.</p><br>

<p id="id05942">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id05943" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Quintus.</p><br>

<p id="id05944">Enter Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus and his Lords.</p><br>

<p id="id05945"> Hip. 'Tis strange my Theseus, y these louers speake of</p><br>

<p id="id05946">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. More strange then true. I neuer may beleeue<br>

These anticke fables, nor these Fairy toyes,<br>

Louers and mad men haue such seething braines,<br>

Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more<br>

Then coole reason euer comprehends.<br>

The Lunaticke, the Louer, and the Poet,<br>

Are of imagination all compact.<br>

One sees more diuels then vaste hell can hold;<br>

That is the mad man. The Louer, all as franticke,<br>

Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egipt.<br>

The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance<br>

From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen.<br>

And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things<br>

Vnknowne; the Poets pen turnes them to shapes,<br>

And giues to aire nothing, a locall habitation,<br>

And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination,<br>

That if it would but apprehend some ioy,<br>

It comprehends some bringer of that ioy.<br>

Or in the night, imagining some feare,<br>

Howe easie is a bush suppos'd a Beare?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip. But all the storie of the night told ouer,<br>

And all their minds transfigur'd so together,<br>

More witnesseth than fancies images,<br>

And growes to something of great constancie;<br>

But howsoeuer, strange, and admirable.<br>

Enter louers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05947">&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Heere come the louers, full of ioy and mirth:<br>

Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh dayes<br>

Of loue accompany your hearts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05948">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. More then to vs, waite in your royall walkes,<br>

your boord, your bed<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05949">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Come now, what maskes, what dances shall<br>

we haue,<br>

To weare away this long age of three houres,<br>

Between our after supper, and bed-time?<br>

Where is our vsuall manager of mirth?<br>

What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play,<br>

To ease the anguish of a torturing houre?<br>

Call Egeus<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05950"> Ege. Heere mighty Theseus</p><br>

<p id="id05951">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Say, what abridgement haue you for this euening?<br>

What maske? What musicke? How shall we beguile<br>

The lazie time, if not with some delight?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ege. There is a breefe how many sports are rife:<br>

Make choise of which your Highnesse will see first<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05952">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lis. The battell with the Centaurs to be sung<br>

By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harpe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05953">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Wee'l none of that. That haue I told my Loue<br>

In glory of my kinsman Hercules<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05954">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lis. The riot of the tipsie Bachanals,<br>

Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The. That is an old deuice, and it was plaid<br>

When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05955">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lis. The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death<br>

of learning, late deceast in beggerie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05956">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. That is some Satire keene and criticall,<br>

Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05957">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lis. A tedious breefe Scene of yong Piramus,<br>

And his loue Thisby; very tragicall mirth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05958">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That<br>

is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee<br>

finde the concord of this discord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ege. A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long,<br>

Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play;<br>

But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long;<br>

Which makes it tedious. For in all the play,<br>

There is not one word apt, one Player fitted.<br>

And tragicall my noble Lord it is: for Piramus<br>

Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw<br>

Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water:<br>

But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter<br>

Neuer shed<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05959">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. What are they that do play it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ege. Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere,<br>

Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now;<br>

And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories<br>

With this same play, against your nuptiall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05960"> The. And we will heare it</p><br>

<p id="id05961">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip. No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard<br>

It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world;<br>

Vnless you can finde sport in their intents,<br>

Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine,<br>

To doe you seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05962">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. I will heare that play. For neuer any thing<br>

Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it.<br>

Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05963">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip. I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged;<br>

And duty in his seruice perishing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05964"> Thes. Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing</p><br>

<p id="id05965"> Hip. He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde</p><br>

<p id="id05966">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing<br>

Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake;<br>

And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect<br>

Takes it in might, not merit.<br>

Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed<br>

To greete me with premeditated welcomes;<br>

Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale,<br>

Make periods in the midst of sentences,<br>

Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares,<br>

And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off,<br>

Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete,<br>

Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome:<br>

And in the modesty of fearefull duty,<br>

I read as much, as from the ratling tongue<br>

Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<br>

Loue therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity,<br>

In least, speake most, to my capacity<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05967"> Egeus. So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest</p><br>

<p id="id05968"> Duke. Let him approach.</p><br>

<p id="id05969">Flor. Trum.</p><br>

<p id="id05970">Enter the Prologue. Quince.</p><br>

<p id="id05971">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro. If we offend, it is with our good will.<br>

That you should thinke, we come not to offend,<br>

But with good will. To shew our simple skill,<br>

That is the true beginning of our end.<br>

Consider then, we come but in despight.<br>

We do not come, as minding to content you,<br>

Our true intent is. All for your delight,<br>

We are not heere. That you should here repent you,<br>

The Actors are at hand; and by their show,<br>

You shall know all, that you are like to know<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05972"> Thes. This fellow doth not stand vpon points</p><br>

<p id="id05973"> Lys. He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he
knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not
enough to speake, but to speake true</p><br>

<p id="id05974">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip. Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a<br>

childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05975">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing<br>

impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05976">Tawyer with a Trumpet before them.</p><br>

<p id="id05977">Enter Pyramus and Thisby, Wall, Moone-shine, and Lyon.</p><br>

<p id="id05978">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prol. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,<br>

But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine.<br>

This man is Piramus, if you would know;<br>

This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certaine.<br>

This man, with lyme and rough-cast, doth present<br>

Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder:<br>

And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content<br>

To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder.<br>

This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne,<br>

Presenteth moone-shine. For if you will know,<br>

By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne<br>

To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe:<br>

This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name)<br>

The trusty Thisby, comming first by night,<br>

Did scarre away, or rather did affright:<br>

And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;<br>

Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine.<br>

Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall,<br>

And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine;<br>

Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade,<br>

He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast,<br>

And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,<br>

His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br>

Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine,<br>

At large discourse, while here they doe remaine.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05979">Exit all but Wall.</p><br>

<p id="id05980"> Thes. I wonder if the Lion be to speake</p><br>

<p id="id05981" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Deme. No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when
many Asses doe.</p><br>

<p id="id05982">Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine.</p><br>

<p id="id05983">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall. In this same Interlude, it doth befall,<br>

That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall:<br>

And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke,<br>

That had in it a crannied hole or chinke:<br>

Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie<br>

Did whisper often, very secretly.<br>

This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew,<br>

That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.<br>

And this the cranny is, right and sinister,<br>

Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05984">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake<br>

better?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deme. It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard<br>

discourse, my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05985">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence.<br>

Enter Pyramus.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05986">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pir. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke,<br>

O night, which euer art, when day is not:<br>

O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke,<br>

I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot.<br>

And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall,<br>

That stands between her fathers ground and mine,<br>

Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall,<br>

Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine.<br>

Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this.<br>

But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see.<br>

O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse,<br>

Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05987">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should<br>

curse againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05988">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me,<br>

Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy<br>

Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.<br>

Enter Thisbie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05989">Pat as I told you; yonder she comes</p><br>

<p id="id05990">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,<br>

For parting my faire Piramus, and me<br>

My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;<br>

Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05991">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,<br>

To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05992">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,<br>

And like Limander am I trusty still<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05993"> This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill</p><br>

<p id="id05994"> Pir. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true</p><br>

<p id="id05995"> This. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you</p><br>

<p id="id05996"> Pir. O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall</p><br>

<p id="id05997"> This. I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all</p><br>

<p id="id05998">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pir. Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight<br>

way?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;This. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id05999">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall. Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so;<br>

And being done, thus Wall away doth go.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06000">Exit Clow.</p><br>

<p id="id06001">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Now is the morall downe between the two<br>

Neighbours<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06002">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull,<br>

to heare without warning<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06003"> Dut. This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard</p><br>

<p id="id06004" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Du. The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the
worst are no worse, if imagination amend them</p><br>

<p id="id06005"> Dut. It must be your imagination then, &amp; not theirs</p><br>

<p id="id06006"> Duk. If wee imagine no worse of them then they of
themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com
two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.
Enter Lyon and Moone-shine</p><br>

<p id="id06007">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare<br>

The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore)<br>

May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere,<br>

When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare.<br>

Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am<br>

A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:<br>

For if I should as Lion come in strife<br>

Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06008"> Du. A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience</p><br>

<p id="id06009"> Dem. The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw</p><br>

<p id="id06010"> Lis. This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor</p><br>

<p id="id06011"> Du. True, and a Goose for his discretion</p><br>

<p id="id06012" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Dem. Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie
his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose</p><br>

<p id="id06013"> Du. His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor:
for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to
his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone</p><br>

<p id="id06014"> Moone. This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present</p><br>

<p id="id06015"> De. He should haue worne the hornes on his head</p><br>

<p id="id06016">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible,<br>

within the circumference<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06017">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon. This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present:<br>

My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06018">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man<br>

Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man<br>

i'th Moone?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. He dares not come there for the candle.<br>

For you see, it is already in snuffe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06019">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. I am wearie of this Moone; would he would<br>

change<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06020"> Du. It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that
he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we
must stay the time</p><br>

<p id="id06021"> Lys. Proceed Moone</p><br>

<p id="id06022"> Moon. All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the
Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this
thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog</p><br>

<p id="id06023"> Dem. Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for
they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby.
Enter Thisby.</p><br>

<p id="id06024">&nbsp;&nbsp;This. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon. Oh.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06025">The Lion roares, Thisby runs off.</p><br>

<p id="id06026"> Dem. Well roar'd Lion</p><br>

<p id="id06027"> Du. Well run Thisby</p><br>

<p id="id06028">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. Well shone Moone.<br>

Truly the Moone shines with a good grace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06029"> Du. Wel mouz'd Lion</p><br>

<p id="id06030"> Dem. And then came Piramus</p><br>

<p id="id06031">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys. And so the Lion vanisht.<br>

Enter Piramus.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06032">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyr. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames,<br>

I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright:<br>

For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames,<br>

I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight.<br>

But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight,<br>

What dreadful dole is heere?<br>

Eyes do you see! How can it be!<br>

O dainty Ducke: O Deere!<br>

Thy mantle good; what staind with blood!<br>

Approch you furies fell:<br>

O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum,<br>

Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06033">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. This passion, and the death of a deare friend,<br>

Would go neere to make a man looke sad<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06034"> Dut. Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man</p><br>

<p id="id06035">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pir. O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame?<br>

Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere:<br>

Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame<br>

That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere.<br>

Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound<br>

The pap of Piramus:<br>

I, that left pap, where heart doth hop;<br>

Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus.<br>

Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky,<br>

Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight,<br>

Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06036"> Dem. No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one</p><br>

<p id="id06037"> Lis. Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing</p><br>

<p id="id06038">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer,<br>

and proue an Asse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06039">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. How chance Moone-shine is gone before?<br>

Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer.<br>

Enter Thisby.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06040">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. She wil finde him by starre-light.<br>

Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06041">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for<br>

such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06042">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dem. A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus<br>

which Thisby is the better<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06043"> Lys. She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes</p><br>

<p id="id06044"> Dem. And thus she meanes, videlicit</p><br>

<p id="id06045">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue?<br>

O Piramus arise:<br>

Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe<br>

Must couer thy sweet eyes.<br>

These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,<br>

<p id="id06048"> Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted
their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or
to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company?
 Duk. No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs
no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all
dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that
writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies
garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is
truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your
Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue.
Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.
I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne,
As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht.
This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd
The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed.
A fortnight hold we this solemnity.
In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie.</p><br>

In remembrance of a shrowd.<br>

Now it is the time of night,<br>

Euery one lets forth his spright,<br>

In the Church-way paths to glide,<br>

And we Fairies, that do runne,<br>

From the presence of the Sunne,<br>

Following darkenesse like a dreame,<br>

Now are frollicke; not a Mouse<br>

<p id="id06060">&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthonio. In sooth I know not why I am so sad,<br>

It wearies me: you say it wearies you;<br>

But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br>

What stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,<br>

I am to learne: and such a Want-wit sadnesse makes of<br>

That I haue much ado to know my selfe<br>

There where your Argosies with portly saile<br>

Like Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood,<br>

Or as it were the Pageants of the sea,<br>

Do ouer-peere the pettie Traffiquers<br>

That curtsie to them, do them reuerence<br>

As they flye by them with their wouen wings<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06062">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar. Beleeue me sir, had I such venture forth,<br>

The better part of my affections, would<br>

Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br>

Plucking the grasse to know where sits the winde,<br>

Peering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:<br>

And euery obiect that might make me feare<br>

Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br>

Would make me sad<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06063">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. My winde cooling my broth,<br>

Would blow me to an Ague, when I thought<br>

What harme a winde too great might doe at sea.<br>

I should not see the sandie houre-glasse runne,<br>

But I should thinke of shallows, and of flats,<br>

And see my wealthy Andrew docks in sand,<br>

Vailing her high top lower then her ribs<br>

To kisse her buriall; should I goe to Church<br>

And see the holy edifice of stone,<br>

And not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>

Which touching but my gentle Vessels side<br>

Would scatter all her spices on the streame,<br>

Enrobe the roring waters with my silkes,<br>

And in a word, but euen now worth this,<br>

And now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought<br>

To thinke on this, and shall I lacke the thought<br>

That such a thing bechaunc'd would make me sad?<br>

But tell me, I know Anthonio<br>

Is sad to thinke vpon his merchandize<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06064">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anth. Beleeue me no, I thanke my fortune for it,<br>

My ventures are not in one bottome trusted,<br>

Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br>

Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easie<br>

For you to laugh and leape, and say you are merry<br>

Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Ianus,<br>

Some that will euermore peepe through their eyes,<br>

And laugh like Parrats at a bag-piper.<br>

With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,<br>

And let my Liuer rather heate with wine,<br>

Then my heart coole with mortifying grones.<br>

Why should a man whose bloud is warme within,<br>

Sit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?<br>

Sleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies<br>

By being peeuish? I tell thee what Anthonio,<br>

I loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:<br>

There are a sort of men, whose visages<br>

Do creame and mantle like a standing pond,<br>

And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,<br>

With purpose to be drest in an opinion<br>

Of wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,<br>

As who should say, I am sir an Oracle,<br>

And when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.<br>

O my Anthonio, I do know of these<br>

That therefore onely are reputed wise,<br>

For saying nothing; when I am verie sure<br>

If they should speake, would almost dam those eares<br>

Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles:<br>

Ile tell thee more of this another time.<br>

But fish not with this melancholly baite<br>

For this foole Gudgin, this opinion:<br>

Come good Lorenzo, faryewell a while,<br>

Ile end my exhortation after dinner<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06079">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.<br>

I must be one of these same dumbe wise men.<br>

For Gratiano neuer let's me speake<br>

<p id="id06080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,<br>

Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue<br>

<p id="id06081"> Ant. Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare</p><br>

<p id="id06082">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable<br>

In a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06083"> Ant. It is that any thing now</p><br>

<p id="id06084"> Bas. Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing,
more then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two
graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall
seeke all day ere you finde them, &amp; when you haue them
they are not worth the search</p><br>

<p id="id06085">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same<br>

To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage<br>

That you to day promis'd to tel me of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio<br>

How much I haue disabled mine estate,<br>

By something shewing a more swelling port<br>

Then my faint meanes would grant continuance:<br>

Nor do I now make mone to be abridg'd<br>

From such a noble rate, but my cheefe care<br>

Is to come fairely off from the great debts<br>

Wherein my time something too prodigall<br>

Hath left me gag'd: to you Anthonio<br>

I owe the most in money, and in loue,<br>

And from your loue I haue a warrantie<br>

To vnburthen all my plots and purposes,<br>

How to get cleere of all the debts I owe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06086">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. I pray you good Bassanio let me know it,<br>

And if it stand as you your selfe still do,<br>

Within the eye of honour, be assur'd<br>

My purse, my person, my extreamest meanes<br>

Lye all vnlock'd to your occasions<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06087">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft<br>

I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight<br>

The selfesame way, with more aduised watch<br>

To finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,<br>

I oft found both. I vrge this child-hoode proofe,<br>

Because what followes is pure innocence.<br>

I owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,<br>

That which I owe is lost: but if you please<br>

To shoote another arrow that selfe way<br>

Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>

As I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,<br>

Or bring your latter hazard backe againe,<br>

And thankfully rest debter for the first<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06088">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>

To winde about my loue with circumstance,<br>

And out of doubt you doe more wrong<br>

In making question of my vttermost<br>

Then if you had made waste of all I haue:<br>

Then doe but say to me what I should doe<br>

That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>

And I am prest vnto it: therefore speake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06089">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. In Belmont is a Lady richly left,<br>

And she is faire, and fairer then that word,<br>

Of wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes<br>

I did receiue faire speechlesse messages:<br>

Her name is Portia, nothing vndervallewd<br>

To Cato's daughter, Brutus Portia,<br>

Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>

For the four windes blow in from euery coast<br>

Renowned sutors, and her sunny locks<br>

Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,<br>

Which makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond,<br>

And many Iasons come in quest of her.<br>

O my Anthonio, had I but the meanes<br>

To hold a riuall place with one of them,<br>

I haue a minde presages me such thrift,<br>

That I should questionlesse be fortunate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06090">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anth. Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,<br>

Neither haue I money, nor commodity<br>

To raise a present summe, therefore goe forth<br>

Try what my credit can in Venice doe,<br>

That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,<br>

To furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia.<br>

Goe presently enquire, and so will I<br>

Where money is, and I no question make<br>

To haue it of my trust, or for my sake.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06091">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06092">Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.</p><br>

<p id="id06093" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Portia. By my troth Nerrissa, my little body is a wearie
of this great world</p><br>

<p id="id06094"> Ner. You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries
were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:
and yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with
too much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal
happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, superfluitie
comes sooner by white haires, but competencie
liues longer</p><br>

<p id="id06095"> Portia. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd</p><br>

<p id="id06096"> Ner. They would be better if well followed</p><br>

<p id="id06097"> Portia. If to doe were as easie as to know what were
good to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore
mens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that
followes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twentie
what were good to be done, then be one of the twentie
to follow mine owne teaching: the braine may deuise
lawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a
colde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip
ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this
reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,
the word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,
nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the wil of a liuing daughter
curb'd by the will of a dead father: it is not hard Nerrissa,
that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none</p><br>

<p id="id06098"> Ner. Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men
at their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lotterie
that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,
siluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,
chooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly,
but one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth
is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
suters that are already come?
 Por. I pray thee ouer-name them, and as thou namest
them, I will describe them, and according to my description
leuell at my affection</p><br>

<p id="id06099"> Ner. First there is the Neopolitane Prince</p><br>

<p id="id06100"> Por. I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but
talke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropriation
to his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe:
I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
with a Smyth</p><br>

<p id="id06101"> Ner. Than is there the Countie Palentine</p><br>

<p id="id06102"> Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should
say, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie
tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping
Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly
sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married
to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either
of these: God defend me from these two</p><br>

<p id="id06103"> Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier
Le Boune?
 Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a
man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,
why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better
bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he
is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight
a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should
marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee
would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me
to madnesse, I should neuer requite him</p><br>

<p id="id06104"> Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong
Baron of England?
 Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,
nor Italian, and you will come into the Court &amp; sweare
that I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a
proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a
dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought
his doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet
in Germanie, and his behauiour euery where</p><br>

<p id="id06105"> Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?
 Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for
he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and
swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I
thinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder
for another</p><br>

<p id="id06106"> Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of
Saxonies Nephew?
 Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,
and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:
when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when
he is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst
fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
him</p><br>

<p id="id06107"> Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,
if you should refuse to accept him</p><br>

<p id="id06108"> Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set
a deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,
for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,
I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa
ere I will be married to a spunge</p><br>

<p id="id06109"> Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of
these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,
which is indeede to returne to their home,
and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may
be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,
depending on the Caskets</p><br>

<p id="id06110"> Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as
chaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
of my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure</p><br>

<p id="id06111"> Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers
time, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that
came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?
 Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee
call'd</p><br>

<p id="id06112"> Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my
foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire
Lady</p><br>

<p id="id06113">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy<br>

of thy praise.<br>

Enter a Seruingman.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06114"> Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
their leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,
the Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his
Maister will be here to night</p><br>

<p id="id06115"> Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be
glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,
and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should
shriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;
whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another
knocks at the doore.</p><br>

<p id="id06116">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06117">Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.</p><br>

<p id="id06118"> Shy. Three thousand ducates, well</p><br>

<p id="id06119"> Bass. I sir, for three months</p><br>

<p id="id06120"> Shy. For three months, well</p><br>

<p id="id06121">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. For the which, as I told you,<br>

Anthonio shall be bound<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06122"> Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well</p><br>

<p id="id06123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?<br>

Shall I know your answere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06124">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Three thousand ducats for three months,<br>

and Anthonio bound<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06125"> Bass. Your answere to that</p><br>

<p id="id06126"> Shy. Anthonio is a good man</p><br>

<p id="id06127"> Bass. Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary</p><br>

<p id="id06128"> Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,
yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie
bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand
moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,
a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath
squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but
men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,
and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the
perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding
sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may
take his bond</p><br>

<p id="id06129"> Bas. Be assured you may</p><br>

<p id="id06130">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,<br>

I will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. If it please you to dine with vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06131"> Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation

What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?
Enter Anthonio.</p><br>

<p id="id06132"> Bass. This is signior Anthonio</p><br>

<p id="id06133">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.<br>

I hate him for he is a Christian:<br>

But more, for that in low simplicitie<br>

He lends out money gratis, and brings downe<br>

The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.<br>

If I can catch him once vpon the hip,<br>

I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.<br>

He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes<br>

Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate<br>

On me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,<br>

Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe<br>

If I forgiue him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06134"> Bass. Shylock, doe you heare</p><br>

<p id="id06135">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I am debating of my present store,<br>

And by the neere gesse of my memorie<br>

I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse<br>

Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?<br>

Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe<br>

Will furnish me: but soft, how many months<br>

Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,<br>

Your worship was the last man in our mouthes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06136">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow<br>

By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,<br>

Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br>

Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest<br>

How much he would?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06137"> Ant. And for three months</p><br>

<p id="id06138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.<br>

Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,<br>

Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow<br>

Vpon aduantage<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06139"> Ant. I doe neuer vse it</p><br>

<p id="id06140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. When Iacob graz'd his vncle Labans sheepe,<br>

This Iacob from our holy Abram was<br>

(As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)<br>

The third possesser; I, he was the third<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06141">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. And what of him, did he take interrest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. No, not take interest, not as you would say<br>

Directly interest, marke what Iacob did,<br>

When Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd<br>

That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied<br>

Should fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,<br>

In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,<br>

And when the worke of generation was<br>

Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,<br>

The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,<br>

And in the dooing of the deede of kinde,<br>

He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,<br>

Who then conceauing, did in eaning time<br>

Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.<br>

This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:<br>

And thrift is blessing if men steale it not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06142">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,<br>

A thing not in his power to bring to passe,<br>

But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.<br>

Was this inserted to make interrest good?<br>

Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,<br>

But note me signior<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06143">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,<br>

The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,<br>

An euill soule producing holy witnesse,<br>

Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,<br>

A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br>

O what a goodly outside falsehood hath<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06144">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.<br>

Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft<br>

In the Ryalto you haue rated me<br>

About my monies and my vsances:<br>

Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug,<br>

(For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)<br>

You call me misbeleeuer, cut-throate dog,<br>

And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,<br>

And all for vse of that which is mine owne.<br>

Well then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:<br>

Goe to then, you come to me, and you say,<br>

Shylocke, we would haue moneyes, you say so:<br>

You that did voide your rume vpon my beard,<br>

And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre<br>

Ouer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.<br>

What should I say to you? Should I not say,<br>

Hath a dog money? Is it possible<br>

A curre should lend three thousand ducats? or<br>

Shall I bend low, and in a bond-mans key<br>

With bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,<br>

Say this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;<br>

You spurn'd me such a day; another time<br>

You cald me dog: and for these curtesies<br>

Ile lend you thus much moneyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06146">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I am as like to call thee so againe,<br>

To spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.<br>

If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br>

As to thy friends, for when did friendship take<br>

A breede of barraine mettall of his friend?<br>

But lend it rather to thine enemie,<br>

Who if he breake, thou maist with better face<br>

Exact the penalties<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06147">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Why looke you how you storme,<br>

I would be friends with you, and haue your loue,<br>

Forget the shames that you haue staind me with,<br>

Supplie your present wants, and take no doite<br>

Of vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,<br>

This is kinde I offer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06148"> Bass. This were kindnesse</p><br>

<p id="id06149">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. This kindnesse will I showe,<br>

Goe with me to a Notarie, seale me there<br>

Your single bond, and in a merrie sport<br>

If you repaie me not on such a day,<br>

In such a place, such sum or sums as are<br>

Exprest in the condition, let the forfeite<br>

Be nominated for an equall pound<br>

Of your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken<br>

In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,<br>

And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06151">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. You shall not seale to such a bond for me,<br>

Ile rather dwell in my necessitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06152">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,<br>

Within these two months, that's a month before<br>

This bond expires, I doe expect returne<br>

Of thrice three times the valew of this bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06153">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. O father Abram, what these Christians are,<br>

Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect<br>

The thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,<br>

If he should breake his daie, what should I gaine<br>

By the exaction of the forfeiture?<br>

A pound of mans flesh taken from a man,<br>

Is not so estimable, profitable neither<br>

As flesh of Muttons, Beefes, or Goates, I say<br>

To buy his fauour, I extend this friendship,<br>

If he will take it, so: if not adiew,<br>

And for my loue I praie you wrong me not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06154"> Ant. Yes Shylocke, I will seale vnto this bond</p><br>

<p id="id06155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries,<br>

Giue him direction for this merrie bond,<br>

And I will goe and purse the ducats straite.<br>

See to my house left in the fearefull gard<br>

Of an vnthriftie knaue: and presentlie<br>

Ile be with you.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06156">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Hie thee gentle Iew. This Hebrew will turne<br>

Christian, he growes kinde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06157"> Bass. I like not faire tearmes, and a villaines minde</p><br>

<p id="id06158">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Come on, in this there can be no dismaie,<br>

My Shippes come home a month before the daie.<br>

Giue him this Letter, doe it secretly,<br>

Pagan, most sweete Iew, if a Christian doe not play the

foolish drops doe somewhat drowne my manly spirit:
adue.

<p id="id06237">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. Farewell good Lancelet.<br>

Alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me<br>

To be ashamed to be my Fathers childe,<br>

But though I am a daughter to his blood,<br>

I am not to his manners: O Lorenzo,<br>

If thou keepe promise I shall end this strife,<br>

Become a Christian, and thy louing wife.<br>

How I shall take her from her Fathers house,<br>

What Iessica, thou shalt not gurmandize<br>

As thou hast done with me: what Iessica?<br>

And sleepe, and snore, and rend apparrell out.<br>

Why Iessica I say<br>

<p id="id06259"> Shy. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call</p><br>

<p id="id06260">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Your worship was wont to tell me<br>

I could doe nothing without bidding.<br>

Enter Iessica.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06261">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. Call you? what is your will?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I am bid forth to supper Iessica,<br>

There are my Keyes: but wherefore should I go?<br>

I am not bid for loue, they flatter me,<br>

But yet Ile goe in hate, to feede vpon<br>

The prodigall Christian. Iessica my girle,<br>

Looke to my house, I am right loath to goe,<br>

There is some ill a bruing towards my rest,<br>

For I did dreame of money bags to night<br>

<p id="id06262">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I beseech you sir goe, my yong Master<br>

Doth expect your reproach<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06263"> Shy. So doe I his</p><br>

<p id="id06264"> Clo. And they haue conspired together, I will not say
you shall see a Maske, but if you doe, then it was not for
nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on blacke monday
last, at six a clocke ith morning, falling out that yeere on

<p id="id06265">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. What are their maskes? heare you me Iessica,<br>

Lock vp my doores, and when you heare the drum<br>

And the vile squealing of the wry-neckt Fife,<br>

Clamber not you vp to the casements then,<br>

Nor thrust your head into the publique streete<br>

To gaze on Christian fooles with varnisht faces:<br>

But stop my houses eares, I meane my casements,<br>

Let not the sound of shallow fopperie enter<br>

My sober house. By Iacobs staffe I sweare,<br>

I haue no minde of feasting forth to night:<br>

But I will goe: goe you before me sirra,<br>

Say I will come<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06266">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I will goe before sir,<br>

Mistris looke out at window for all this;<br>

There will come a Christian by,<br>

Will be worth a Iewes eye<br>

Snaile-slow in profit, but he sleepes by day<br>

More then the wilde-cat: drones hiue not with me,<br>

Therefore I part with him, and part with him<br>

To one that I would haue him helpe to waste<br>

His borrowed purse. Well Iessica goe in,<br>

Perhaps I will returne immediately;<br>

To steale loues bonds new made, then they are wont<br>

To keepe obliged faith vnforfaited<br>

With that keene appetite that he sits downe?<br>

Where is the horse that doth vntread againe<br>

His tedious measures with the vnbated fire,<br>

That he did pace them first: all things that are,<br>

Are with more spirit chased then enioy'd.<br>

How like a yonger or a prodigall<br>

The skarfed barke puts from her natiue bay,<br>

Hudg'd and embraced by the strumpet winde:<br>

How like a prodigall doth she returne<br>

With ouer-wither'd ribs and ragged sailes,<br>

Leane, rent, and begger'd by the strumpet winde?<br>

Enter Lorenzo.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06277"> Salino. Heere comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter</p><br>

<p id="id06278">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Sweete friends, your patience for my long abode,<br>

Not I, but my affaires haue made you wait;<br>

When you shall please to play the theeues for wiues<br>

Ile watch as long for you then: approach<br>

Here dwels my father Iew. Hoa, who's within?<br>

For who loue I so much? and now who knowes<br>

But you Lorenzo, whether I am yours?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Heauen and thy thoughts are witness that thou<br>

art<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06283">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. Heere, catch this casket, it is worth the paines,<br>

I am glad 'tis night, you do not looke on me,<br>

For I am much asham'd of my exchange:<br>

But loue is blinde, and louers cannot see<br>

The pretty follies that themselues commit,<br>

For if they could, Cupid himselfe would blush<br>

To see me thus transformed to a boy<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06284"> Lor. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer</p><br>

<p id="id06285">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. What, must I hold a Candle to my shames?<br>

They in themselues goodsooth are too too light.<br>

Why, 'tis an office of discouery Loue,<br>

And I should be obscur'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06286">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. So you are sweet,<br>

Euen in the louely garnish of a boy: but come at once,<br>

For the close night doth play the run-away,<br>

And we are staid for at Bassanio's feast<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06287">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. I will make fast the doores and guild my selfe<br>

With some more ducats, and be with you straight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06288"> Gra. Now by my hood, a gentle, and no Iew</p><br>

<p id="id06289">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Beshrew me but I loue her heartily.<br>

For she is wise, if I can iudge of her.<br>

And faire she is, if that mine eyes be true,<br>

And true she is, as she hath prou'd her selfe:<br>

And therefore like her selfe, wise, faire, and true,<br>

Shall she be placed in my constant soule.<br>

'Tis nine a clocke, our friends all stay for you,<br>

No maske to night, the winde is come about,<br>

Bassanio presently will goe aboord,<br>

I haue sent twenty out to seeke for you<br>

<p id="id06295">Enter Portia with Morrocho, and both their traines.</p><br>

<p id="id06296">&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Goe, draw aside the curtaines, and discouer<br>

The seuerall Caskets to this noble Prince:<br>

Now make your choyse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06297">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. The first of gold, who this inscription beares,<br>

Who chooseth me, shall gaine what men desire.<br>

The second siluer, which this promise carries,<br>

Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.<br>

This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,<br>

Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.<br>

How shall I know if I doe choose the right?<br>

How shall I know if I doe choose the right<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06298">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. The one of them containes my picture Prince,<br>

If you choose that, then I am yours withall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06299">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. Some God direct my iudgement, let me see,<br>

I will suruay the inscriptions, backe againe:<br>

What saies this leaden casket?<br>

Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.<br>

Must giue, for what? for lead, hazard for lead?<br>

This casket threatens men that hazard all<br>

Doe it in hope of faire aduantages:<br>

A golden minde stoopes not to showes of drosse,<br>

Ile then nor giue nor hazard ought for lead.<br>

What saies the Siluer with her virgin hue?<br>

Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.<br>

As much as he deserues; pause there Morocho,<br>

And weigh thy value with an euen hand,<br>

If thou beest rated by thy estimation<br>

Thou doost deserue enough, and yet enough<br>

May not extend so farre as to the Ladie:<br>

And yet to be afeard of my deseruing,<br>

Were but a weake disabling of my selfe.<br>

As much as I deserue, why that's the Lady.<br>

I doe in birth deserue her, and in fortunes,<br>

In graces, and in qualities of breeding:<br>

But more then these, in loue I doe deserue.<br>

What if I strai'd no farther, but chose here?<br>

Let's see once more this saying grau'd in gold.<br>

Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire:<br>

Why that's the Lady, all the world desires her:<br>

From the foure corners of the earth they come<br>

To kisse this shrine, this mortall breathing Saint.<br>

The Hircanion deserts, and the vaste wildes<br>

Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now<br>

For Princes to come view faire Portia.<br>

The waterie Kingdome, whose ambitious head<br>

Spets in the face of heauen, is no barre<br>

To stop the forraine spirits, but they come<br>

As ore a brooke to see faire Portia.<br>

One of these three containes her heauenly picture.<br>

Is't like that Lead containes her? 'twere damnation<br>

To thinke so base a thought, it were too grose<br>

To rib her searecloath in the obscure graue:<br>

Or shall I thinke in Siluer she's immur'd<br>

Being ten times vndervalued to tride gold;<br>

O sinfull thought, neuer so rich a Iem<br>

Was set in worse then gold! They haue in England<br>

A coyne that beares the figure of an Angell<br>

Stampt in gold, but that's insculpt vpon:<br>

But here an Angell in a golden bed<br>

Lies all within. Deliuer me the key:<br>

Here doe I choose, and thriue I as I may<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. There take it Prince, and if my forme lye there<br>

Then I am yours<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06301">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. O hell! what haue we here, a carrion death,<br>

Within whose emptie eye there is a written scroule;<br>

Ile reade the writing.<br>

All that glisters is not gold,<br>

Often haue you heard that told;<br>

Many a man his life hath sold<br>

But my outside to behold;<br>

Guilded timber doe wormes infold:<br>

Had you beene as wise as bold,<br>

Yong in limbs, in iudgement old,<br>

Your answere had not beene inscrold,<br>

Fareyouwell, your suite is cold,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. Cold indeede, and labour lost,<br>

Then farewell heate, and welcome frost:<br>

Portia adew, I haue too grieu'd a heart<br>

To take a tedious leaue: thus loosers part.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06302">&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. A gentle riddance: draw the curtaines, go:<br>

Let all of his complexion choose me so.<br>

With him is Gratiano gone along;<br>

And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06307">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. The villaine Iew with outcries raisd the Duke.<br>

Who went with him to search Bassanios ship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06308">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. He comes too late, the ship was vndersaile;<br>

But there the Duke was giuen to vnderstand<br>

That in a Gondilo were seene together<br>

Lorenzo and his amorous Iessica.<br>

Besides, Anthonio certified the Duke<br>

They were not with Bassanio in his ship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06309">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. I neuer heard a passion so confusd,<br>

So strange, outragious, and so variable,<br>

As the dogge Iew did vtter in the streets;<br>

My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter,<br>

Fled with a Christian, O my Christian ducats!<br>

Iustice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter;<br>

A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,<br>

Of double ducats, stolne from me by my daughter,<br>

And iewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,<br>

Stolne by my daughter: iustice, finde the girle,<br>

She hath the stones vpon her, and the ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06310">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Why all the boyes in Venice follow him,<br>

Crying his stones, his daughter, and his ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06311">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. Let good Anthonio looke he keepe his day<br>

Or he shall pay for this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06312">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Marry well remembred,<br>

I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,<br>

Who told me, in the narrow seas that part<br>

The French and English, there miscaried<br>

A vessell of our countrey richly fraught:<br>

I thought vpon Anthonio when he told me,<br>

And wisht in silence that it were not his<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06313">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. You were best to tell Anthonio what you heare.<br>

Yet doe not suddainely, for it may grieue him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06314">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. A kinder Gentleman treads not the earth,<br>

I saw Bassanio and Anthonio part,<br>

Bassanio told him he would make some speede<br>

Of his returne: he answered, doe not so,<br>

Slubber not businesse for my sake Bassanio,<br>

But stay the very riping of the time,<br>

And for the Iewes bond which he hath of me,<br>

Let it not enter in your minde of loue:<br>

Be merry, and imploy your chiefest thoughts<br>

To courtship, and such faire ostents of loue<br>

As shall conueniently become you there;<br>

And euen there his eye being big with teares,<br>

Turning his face, he put his hand behinde him,<br>

And with affection wondrous sencible<br>

He wrung Bassanios hand, and so they parted<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06315">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. I thinke he onely loues the world for him,<br>

I pray thee let vs goe and finde him out<br>

And quicken his embraced heauinesse<br>

But if thou faile, without more speech my Lord,<br>

You must be gone from hence immediately<br>

Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I faile<br>

Of the right casket, neuer in my life<br>

To wooe a maide in way of marriage:<br>

Lastly, if I doe faile in fortune of my choyse,<br>

Immediately to leaue you, and be gone<br>

<p id="id06322">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. To these iniunctions euery one doth sweare<br>

That comes to hazard for my worthlesse selfe<br>

<p id="id06323">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. And so haue I addrest me, fortune now<br>

To my hearts hope: gold, siluer, and base lead.<br>

Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath.<br>

You shall looke fairer ere I giue or hazard.<br>

What saies the golden chest, ha, let me see.<br>

Who chooseth me, shall gaine what many men desire:<br>

What many men desire, that many may be meant<br>

By the foole multitude that choose by show,<br>

Not learning more then the fond eye doth teach,<br>

Which pries not to th' interior, but like the Martlet<br>

Builds in the weather on the outward wall,<br>

Euen in the force and rode of casualtie.<br>

I will not choose what many men desire,<br>

Because I will not iumpe with common spirits,<br>

And ranke me with the barbarous multitudes.<br>

Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house,<br>

Tell me once more, what title thou doost beare;<br>

Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues:<br>

And well said too; for who shall goe about<br>

To cosen Fortune, and be honourable<br>

Without the stampe of merrit, let none presume<br>

To weare an vndeserued dignitie:<br>

O that estates, degrees, and offices,<br>

Were not deriu'd corruptly, and that cleare honour<br>

Were purchast by the merrit of the wearer;<br>

How many then should couer that stand bare?<br>

How many be commanded that command?<br>

How much low pleasantry would then be gleaned<br>

From the true seede of honor? And how much honor<br>

Pickt from the chaffe and ruine of the times,<br>

To be new varnisht: Well, but to my choise.<br>

Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues.<br>

I will assume desert; giue me a key for this,<br>

And instantly vnlocke my fortunes here<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06324"> Por. Too long a pause for that which you finde there</p><br>

<p id="id06325">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. What's here, the portrait of a blinking idiot<br>

Presenting me a scedule, I will reade it:<br>

How much vnlike art thou to Portia?<br>

How much vnlike my hopes and my deseruings?<br>

Who chooseth me, shall haue as much as he deserues.<br>

Did I deserue no more then a fooles head,<br>

Is that my prize, are my deserts no better?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. To offend and iudge are distinct offices,<br>

And of opposed natures<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06326">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. What is here?<br>

The fier seauen times tried this,<br>

Seauen times tried that iudgement is,<br>

That did neuer choose amis,<br>

Some there be that shadowes kisse,<br>

Such haue but a shadowes blisse:<br>

There be fooles aliue Iwis<br>

Siluer'd o're, and so was this:<br>

Take what wife you will to bed,<br>

I will euer be your head:<br>

So be gone, you are sped<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06327">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Still more foole I shall appeare<br>

By the time I linger here,<br>

With one fooles head I came to woo,<br>

But I goe away with two.<br>

Sweet adue, Ile keepe my oath,<br>

Patiently to beare my wroath<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moath:<br>

O these deliberate fooles when they doe choose,<br>

They haue the wisdome by their wit to loose<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06329">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. The ancient saying is no heresie,<br>

Hanging and wiuing goes by destinie<br>

Enter Messenger.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06331">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. Where is my Lady?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Here, what would my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. Madam, there is a-lighted at your gate<br>

A yong Venetian, one that comes before<br>

To signifie th' approaching of his Lord,<br>

From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;<br>

To wit (besides commends and curteous breath)<br>

Gifts of rich value; yet I haue not seene<br>

So likely an Embassador of loue.<br>

A day in Aprill neuer came so sweete<br>

To show how costly Sommer was at hand,<br>

As this fore-spurrer comes before his Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06332">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. No more I pray thee, I am halfe a-feard<br>

Thou wilt say anone he is some kin to thee,<br>

Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him:<br>

Come, come Nerryssa, for I long to see<br>

Quicke Cupids Post, that comes so mannerly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06333"> Ner. Bassanio Lord, loue if thy will it be.</p><br>

<p id="id06334">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06335" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Tertius.</p><br>

<p id="id06336">Enter Solanio and Salarino.</p><br>

<p id="id06337"> Sol. Now, what newes on the Ryalto?
 Sal. Why yet it liues there vncheckt, that Anthonio
hath a ship of rich lading wrackt on the narrow Seas; the
Goodwins I thinke they call the place, a very dangerous
flat, and fatall, where the carcasses of many a tall ship, lye
buried, as they say, if my gossips report be an honest woman
of her word</p><br>

<p id="id06338"> Sol. I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as euer
knapt Ginger, or made her neighbours beleeue she wept
for the death of a third husband: but it is true, without
any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plaine high-way of
talke, that the good Anthonio, the honest Anthonio; o that
I had a title good enough to keepe his name company!
 Sal. Come, the full stop</p><br>

<p id="id06339" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Sol. Ha, what sayest thou, why the end is, he hath lost
a ship</p><br>

<p id="id06340"> Sal. I would it might proue the end of his losses</p><br>

<p id="id06341"> Sol. Let me say Amen betimes, least the diuell crosse
my praier, for here he comes in the likenes of a Iew. How
now Shylocke, what newes among the Merchants?
Enter Shylocke.</p><br>

<p id="id06342">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. You knew none so well, none so well as you, of<br>

my daughters flight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06343">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. That's certaine, I for my part knew the Tailor<br>

that made the wings she flew withall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06344"> Sol. And Shylocke for his owne part knew the bird was
fledg'd, and then it is the complexion of them al to leaue
the dam</p><br>

<p id="id06345"> Shy. She is damn'd for it</p><br>

<p id="id06346"> Sal. That's certaine, if the diuell may be her Iudge</p><br>

<p id="id06347"> Shy. My owne flesh and blood to rebell</p><br>

<p id="id06348"> Sol. Out vpon it old carrion, rebels it at these yeeres</p><br>

<p id="id06349"> Shy. I say my daughter is my flesh and bloud</p><br>

<p id="id06350"> Sal. There is more difference betweene thy flesh and
hers, then betweene Iet and Iuorie, more betweene your
bloods, then there is betweene red wine and rennish: but
tell vs, doe you heare whether Anthonio haue had anie
losse at sea or no?
 Shy. There I haue another bad match, a bankrout, a
prodigall, who dare scarce shew his head on the Ryalto,
a begger that was vsd to come so smug vpon the Mart:
let him look to his bond, he was wont to call me Vsurer,
let him looke to his bond, he was wont to lend money
for a Christian curtsie, let him looke to his bond</p><br>

<p id="id06351"> Sal. Why I am sure if he forfaite, thou wilt not take
his flesh, what's that good for?
 Shy. To baite fish withall, if it will feede nothing
else, it will feede my reuenge; he hath disgrac'd me, and
hindred me halfe a million, laught at my losses, mockt at
my gaines, scorned my Nation, thwarted my bargaines,
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's the
reason? I am a Iewe: Hath not a Iew eyes? hath not a
Iew hands, organs, dementions, sences, affections, passions,
fed with the same foode, hurt with the same weapons,
subiect to the same diseases, healed by the same
meanes, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and
Sommer as a Christian is: if you pricke vs doe we not
bleede? if you tickle vs, doe we not laugh? if you poison
vs doe we not die? and if you wrong vs shall we not reuenge?
if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
in that. If a Iew wrong a Christian, what is his humility,
reuenge? If a Christian wrong a Iew, what should his sufferance
be by Christian example, why reuenge? The villanie
you teach me I will execute, and it shall goe hard
but I will better the instruction.
Enter a man from Anthonio.</p><br>

<p id="id06352">Gentlemen, my maister Anthonio is at his house, and
desires to speake with you both</p><br>

<p id="id06353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke him.<br>

Enter Tuball.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06354">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. Here comes another of the Tribe, a third cannot<br>

be matcht, vnlesse the diuell himselfe turne Iew.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06355">Exeunt. Gentlemen</p><br>

<p id="id06356">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. How now Tuball, what newes from Genowa? hast<br>

thou found my daughter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tub. I often came where I did heare of her, but cannot<br>

finde her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06357"> Shy. Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone
cost me two thousand ducats in Franckford, the curse neuer
fell vpon our Nation till now, I neuer felt it till now,
two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious
iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my
foote, and the duckets in her coffin: no newes of them,
why so? and I know not how much is spent in the search:
why thou losse vpon losse, the theefe gone with so
much, and so much to finde the theefe, and no satisfaction,
no reuenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights
a my shoulders, no sighes but a my breathing, no teares
but a my shedding</p><br>

<p id="id06358">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tub. Yes, other men haue ill lucke too, Anthonio as I<br>

heard in Genowa?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. What, what, what, ill lucke, ill lucke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06359"> Tub. Hath an Argosie cast away comming from Tripolis</p><br>

<p id="id06360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I thanke God, I thanke God, is it true, is it true?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tub. I spoke with some of the Saylers that escaped<br>

the wracke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06361">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I thanke thee good Tuball, good newes, good<br>

newes: ha, ha, here in Genowa<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tub. Your daughter spent in Genowa, as I heard, one<br>

night fourescore ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06363">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Thou stick'st a dagger in me, I shall neuer see my<br>

gold againe, fourescore ducats at a sitting, fourescore ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06364"> Tub. There came diuers of Anthonios creditors in my
company to Venice, that sweare hee cannot choose but
breake</p><br>

<p id="id06365">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I am very glad of it, ile plague him, ile torture<br>

him, I am glad of it,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tub. One of them shewed me a ring that hee had of<br>

your daughter for a Monkie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06366"> Shy. Out vpon her, thou torturest me Tuball, it was
my Turkies, I had it of Leah when I was a Batcheler: I
would not haue giuen it for a wildernesse of Monkies</p><br>

<p id="id06367"> Tub. But Anthonio is certainely vndone</p><br>

<p id="id06368"> Shy. Nay, that's true, that's very true, goe Tuball, see
me an Officer, bespeake him a fortnight before, I will
haue the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice,
I can make what merchandize I will: goe Tuball,
and meete me at our Sinagogue, goe good Tuball, at our
Sinagogue Tuball.</p><br>

<p id="id06369">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06370">Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, and all their traine.</p><br>

<p id="id06371">&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I pray you tarrie, pause a day or two<br>

Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong<br>

I loose your companie; therefore forbeare a while,<br>

There's something tels me (but it is not loue)<br>

I would not loose you, and you know your selfe,<br>

Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie;<br>

But least you should not vnderstand me well,<br>

And yet a maiden hath no tongue, but thought,<br>

I would detaine you here some month or two<br>

Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br>

How to choose right, but then I am forsworne,<br>

So will I neuer be, so may you misse me,<br>

But if you doe, youle make me wish a sinne,<br>

That I had beene forsworne: Beshrow your eyes,<br>

They haue ore-lookt me and deuided me,<br>

One halfe of me is yours, the other halfe yours,<br>

Mine owne I would say: but of mine then yours,<br>

And so all yours; O these naughtie times<br>

Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights.<br>

And so though yours, not yours (proue it so)<br>

Let Fortune goe to hell for it, not I.<br>

I speake too long, but 'tis to peize the time,<br>

To ich it, and to draw it out in length,<br>

To stay you from election<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06372">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Let me choose,<br>

For as I am, I liue vpon the racke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06373">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Vpon the racke Bassanio, then confesse<br>

What treason there is mingled with your loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06374">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. None but that vglie treason of mistrust.<br>

Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue:<br>

There may as well be amitie and life,<br>

'Tweene snow and fire, as treason and my loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06375">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I, but I feare you speake vpon the racke,<br>

Where men enforced doth speake any thing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06376"> Bass. Promise me life, and ile confesse the truth</p><br>

<p id="id06377"> Por. Well then, confesse and liue</p><br>

<p id="id06378">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Confesse and loue<br>

Had beene the verie sum of my confession:<br>

O happie torment, when my torturer<br>

Doth teach me answers for deliuerance:<br>

But let me to my fortune and the caskets<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06379">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Away then, I am lockt in one of them,<br>

If you doe loue me, you will finde me out.<br>

Nerryssa and the rest, stand all aloofe,<br>

Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise,<br>

Then if he loose he makes a Swan-like end,<br>

Fading in musique. That the comparison<br>

May stand more proper, my eye shall be the streame<br>

And watrie death-bed for him: he may win,<br>

And what is musique than? Than musique is<br>

Euen as the flourish, when true subiects bowe<br>

To a new crowned Monarch: Such it is,<br>

As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day,<br>

That creepe into the dreaming bride-groomes eare,<br>

And summon him to marriage. Now he goes<br>

With no lesse presence, but with much more loue<br>

Then yong Alcides, when he did redeeme<br>

The virgine tribute, paied by howling Troy<br>

To the Sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice,<br>

The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues:<br>

With bleared visages come forth to view<br>

The issue of th' exploit: Goe Hercules,<br>

Liue thou, I liue with much more dismay<br>

I view the sight, then thou that mak'st the fray.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06380">Here Musicke. A Song the whilst Bassanio comments on the
Caskets to
himselfe.</p><br>

<p id="id06381">Tell me where is fancie bred,<br>

Or in the heart, or in the head:<br>

How begot, how nourished. Replie, replie.<br>

It is engendred in the eyes,<br>

With gazing fed, and Fancie dies,<br>

In the cradle where it lies:<br>

Let vs all ring Fancies knell.<br>

Ile begin it.<br>

Ding, dong, bell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06382"> All. Ding, dong, bell</p><br>

<p id="id06383">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. So may the outward showes be least themselues<br>

The world is still deceiu'd with ornament.<br>

In Law, what Plea so tainted and corrupt,<br>

But being season'd with a gracious voice,<br>

Obscures the show of euill? In Religion,<br>

What damned error, but some sober brow<br>

Will blesse it, and approue it with a text,<br>

Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament:<br>

There is no voice so simple, but assumes<br>

Some marke of vertue on his outward parts;<br>

How manie cowards, whose hearts are all as false<br>

As stayers of sand, weare yet vpon their chins<br>

The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,<br>

Who inward searcht, haue lyuers white as milke,<br>

And these assume but valors excrement,<br>

To render them redoubted. Looke on beautie,<br>

And you shall see 'tis purchast by the weight,<br>

Which therein workes a miracle in nature,<br>

Making them lightest that weare most of it:<br>

So are those crisped snakie golden locks<br>

Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde<br>

Vpon supposed fairenesse, often knowne<br>

To be the dowrie of a second head,<br>

The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher.<br>

Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<br>

To a most dangerous sea: the beautious scarfe<br>

Vailing an Indian beautie; In a word,<br>

The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br>

To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold,<br>

Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,<br>

Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge<br>

'Tweene man and man: but thou, thou meager lead<br>

Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought,<br>

Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence,<br>

And here choose I, ioy be the consequence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06384">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. How all the other passions fleet to ayre,<br>

As doubtfull thoughts, and rash imbrac'd despaire:<br>

And shuddring feare, and greene-eyed iealousie.<br>

O loue be moderate, allay thy extasie,<br>

In measure raine thy ioy, scant this excesse,<br>

I feele too much thy blessing, make it lesse,<br>

For feare I surfeit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06385">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. What finde I here?<br>

Faire Portias counterfeit. What demie God<br>

Hath come so neere creation? moue these eies?<br>

Or whether riding on the bals of mine<br>

Seeme they in motion? Here are seuer'd lips<br>

Parted with suger breath, so sweet a barre<br>

Should sunder such sweet friends: here in her haires<br>

The Painter plaies the Spider, and hath wouen<br>

A golden mesh t' intrap the hearts of men<br>

Faster then gnats in cobwebs: but her eies,<br>

How could he see to doe them? hauing made one,<br>

Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his<br>

And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht: Yet looke how farre<br>

The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br>

In vnderprising it, so farre this shadow<br>

Doth limpe behinde the substance. Here's the scroule,<br>

The continent, and summarie of my fortune.<br>

You that choose not by the view<br>

Chance as faire, and choose as true:<br>

Since this fortune fals to you,<br>

Be content, and seeke no new.<br>

If you be well pleasd with this,<br>

And hold your fortune for your blisse,<br>

Turne you where your Lady is,<br>

And claime her with a louing kisse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06386">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,<br>

I come by note to giue, and to receiue,<br>

Like one of two contending in a prize<br>

That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:<br>

Hearing applause and vniuersall shout,<br>

Giddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br>

Whether those peales of praise be his or no.<br>

So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,<br>

As doubtfull whether what I see be true,<br>

Vntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06387">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand,<br>

Such as I am; though for my selfe alone<br>

I would not be ambitious in my wish,<br>

To wish my selfe much better, yet for you,<br>

I would be trebled twenty times my selfe,<br>

A thousand times more faire, ten thousand times<br>

More rich, that onely to stand high in your account,<br>

I might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,<br>

Exceed account: but the full summe of me<br>

Is sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,<br>

Is an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,<br>

Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br>

But she may learne: happier then this,<br>

Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne;<br>

Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit<br>

Commits it selfe to yours to be directed,<br>

As from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.<br>

My selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours<br>

Is now conuerted. But now I was the Lord<br>

Of this faire mansion, master of my seruants,<br>

Queene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,<br>

This house, these seruants, and this same my selfe<br>

Are yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,<br>

Which when you part from, loose, or giue away,<br>

Let it presage the ruine of your loue,<br>

And be my vantage to exclaime on you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06388">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,<br>

Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,<br>

And there is such confusion in my powers,<br>

As after some oration fairely spoke<br>

By a beloued Prince, there doth appeare<br>

Among the buzzing pleased multitude,<br>

Where euery something being blent together,<br>

Turnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy<br>

Exprest, and not exprest: but when this ring<br>

Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence,<br>

O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06389">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. My Lord and Lady, it is now our time<br>

That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,<br>

To cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06390">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle Lady,<br>

I wish you all the ioy that you can wish:<br>

For I am sure you can wish none from me:<br>

And when your Honours meane to solemnize<br>

The bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you<br>

Euen at that time I may be married too<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06391"> Bass. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife</p><br>

<p id="id06392">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.<br>

My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:<br>

You saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:<br>

You lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,<br>

No more pertaines to me my Lord then you;<br>

Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there,<br>

And so did mine too, as the matter falls:<br>

For wooing heere vntill I swet againe,<br>

And swearing till my very rough was dry<br>

With oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,<br>

I got a promise of this faire one heere<br>

To haue her loue: prouided that your fortune<br>

Atchieu'd her mistresse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06393">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Is this true Nerrissa?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06394">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. And doe you Gratiano meane good faith?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Yes faith my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06395"> Bass. Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage</p><br>

<p id="id06396">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Weele play with them the first boy for a thousand<br>

ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06397">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. What and stake downe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. No, we shal nere win at that sport, and stake<br>

downe.<br>

But who comes heere? Lorenzo and his Infidell?<br>

What and my old Venetian friend Salerio?<br>

Enter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06398">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hether,<br>

If that the youth of my new interest heere<br>

Haue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue<br>

I bid my verie friends and Countrimen<br>

Sweet Portia welcome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06399"> Por. So do I my Lord, they are intirely welcome</p><br>

<p id="id06400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,<br>

My purpose was not to haue seene you heere,<br>

But meeting with Salerio by the way,<br>

He did intreate mee past all saying nay<br>

To come with him along<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06401">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. I did my Lord,<br>

And I haue reason for it, Signior Anthonio<br>

Commends him to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06402">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Ere I ope his Letter<br>

I pray you tell me how my good friend doth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06403">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,<br>

Nor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there<br>

Wil shew you his estate.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06404">Opens the Letter.</p><br>

<p id="id06405">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Nerrissa, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.<br>

Your hand Salerio, what's the newes from Venice?<br>

How doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio;<br>

I know he will be glad of our successe,<br>

We are the Iasons, we haue won the fleece<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06406">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. I would you had won the fleece that hee hath<br>

lost<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06407">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. There are some shrewd contents in yond same<br>

Paper,<br>

That steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke,<br>

Some deere friend dead, else nothing in the world<br>

Could turne so much the constitution<br>

Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?<br>

With leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe,<br>

And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing<br>

That this same paper brings you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06408">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. O sweet Portia,<br>

Heere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words<br>

That euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie<br>

When I did first impart my loue to you,<br>

I freely told you all the wealth I had<br>

Ran in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,<br>

And then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,<br>

Rating my selfe at nothing, you shall see<br>

How much I was a Braggart, when I told you<br>

My state was nothing, I should then haue told you<br>

That I was worse then nothing: for indeede<br>

I haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,<br>

Ingag'd my friend to his meere enemie<br>

To feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,<br>

The paper as the bodie of my friend,<br>

And euerie word in it a gaping wound<br>

Issuing life blood. But is it true Salerio,<br>

Hath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,<br>

From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<br>

From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,<br>

And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch<br>

Of Merchant-marring rocks?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Not one my Lord.<br>

Besides, it should appeare, that if he had<br>

The present money to discharge the Iew,<br>

He would not take it: neuer did I know<br>

A creature that did beare the shape of man<br>

So keene and greedy to confound a man.<br>

He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,<br>

And doth impeach the freedome of the state<br>

If they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,<br>

The Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes<br>

Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him,<br>

But none can driue him from the enuious plea<br>

Of forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06409">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iessi. When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare<br>

To Tuball and to Chus, his Countri-men,<br>

That he would rather haue Anthonio's flesh,<br>

Then twenty times the value of the summe<br>

That he did owe him: and I know my Lord,<br>

If law, authoritie, and power denie not,<br>

It will goe hard with poore Anthonio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06410">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,<br>

The best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit<br>

In doing curtesies: and one in whom<br>

The ancient Romane honour more appeares<br>

Then any that drawes breath in Italie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06411">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. What summe owes he the Iew?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. For me three thousand ducats<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06412">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. What, no more?<br>

Pay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:<br>

Double sixe thousand, and then treble that,<br>

Before a friend of this description<br>

Shall lose a haire through Bassanio's fault.<br>

First goe with me to Church, and call me wife,<br>

And then away to Venice to your friend:<br>

For neuer shall you lie by Portias side<br>

With an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold<br>

To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.<br>

When it is payd, bring your true friend along,<br>

My maid Nerrissa, and my selfe meane time<br>

Will liue as maids and widdowes; come away,<br>

For you shall hence vpon your wedding day:<br>

Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,<br>

Since you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.<br>

But let me heare the letter of your friend.<br>

Sweet Bassanio, my ships haue all miscarried, my Creditors<br>

grow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is<br>

forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all<br>

debts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my<br>

death: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not<br>

perswade you to come, let not my letter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06413"> Por. O loue! dispach all busines and be gone</p><br>

<p id="id06414">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,<br>

I will make hast; but till I come againe,<br>

No bed shall ere be guilty of my stay,<br>

Nor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06415">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06416">Enter the Iew, and Solanio, and Anthonio, and the Iaylor.</p><br>

<p id="id06417">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. Iaylor, looke to him, tell not me of mercy,<br>

This is the foole that lends out money gratis.<br>

Iaylor, looke to him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06418"> Ant. Heare me yet good Shylok</p><br>

<p id="id06419">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. Ile haue my bond, speake not against my bond,<br>

I haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond:<br>

Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,<br>

But since I am a dog, beware my phangs,<br>

The Duke shall grant me iustice, I do wonder<br>

Thou naughty Iaylor, that thou art so fond<br>

To come abroad with him at his request<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06420"> Ant. I pray thee heare me speake</p><br>

<p id="id06421">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. Ile haue my bond, I will not heare thee speake,<br>

Ile haue my bond, and therefore speake no more,<br>

Ile not be made a soft and dull ey'd foole,<br>

To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yeeld<br>

To Christian intercessors: follow not,<br>

Ile haue no speaking, I will haue my bond.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06422">Exit Iew.</p><br>

<p id="id06423">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. It is the most impenetrable curre<br>

That euer kept with men<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06424">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Let him alone,<br>

Ile follow him no more with bootlesse prayers:<br>

He seekes my life, his reason well I know;<br>

I oft deliuer'd from his forfeitures<br>

Many that haue at times made mone to me,<br>

Therefore he hates me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06425">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sol. I am sure the Duke will neuer grant<br>

this forfeiture to hold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06426">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. The Duke cannot deny the course of law:<br>

For the commoditie that strangers haue<br>

With vs in Venice, if it be denied,<br>

Will much impeach the iustice of the State,<br>

Since that the trade and profit of the citty<br>

Consisteth of all Nations. Therefore goe,<br>

These greefes and losses haue so bated mee,<br>

That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh<br>

To morrow, to my bloudy Creditor.<br>

Well Iaylor, on, pray God Bassanio come<br>

To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06427">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06428">Enter Portia, Nerrissa, Lorenzo, Iessica, and a man of Portias.</p><br>

<p id="id06429">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Madam, although I speake it in your presence,<br>

You haue a noble and a true conceit<br>

Of god-like amity, which appeares most strongly<br>

In bearing thus the absence of your Lord.<br>

But if you knew to whom you shew this honour,<br>

How true a Gentleman you send releefe,<br>

How deere a louer of my Lord your husband,<br>

I know you would be prouder of the worke<br>

Then customary bounty can enforce you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06430">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I neuer did repent for doing good,<br>

Nor shall not now: for in companions<br>

That do conuerse and waste the time together,<br>

Whose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue.<br>

There must be needs a like proportion<br>

Of lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;<br>

Which makes me thinke that this Anthonio<br>

Being the bosome louer of my Lord,<br>

Must needs be like my Lord. If it be so,<br>

How little is the cost I haue bestowed<br>

In purchasing the semblance of my soule;<br>

From out the state of hellish cruelty,<br>

This comes too neere the praising of my selfe,<br>

Therefore no more of it: heere other things<br>

Lorenso I commit into your hands,<br>

The husbandry and mannage of my house,<br>

Vntill my Lords returne; for mine owne part<br>

I haue toward heauen breath'd a secret vow,<br>

To liue in prayer and contemplation,<br>

Onely attended by Nerrissa heere,<br>

Vntill her husband and my Lords returne:<br>

There is a monastery too miles off,<br>

And there we will abide. I doe desire you<br>

Not to denie this imposition,<br>

The which my loue and some necessity<br>

Now layes vpon you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06431">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorens. Madame, with all my heart,<br>

I shall obey you in all faire commands<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06432">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. My people doe already know my minde,<br>

And will acknowledge you and Iessica<br>

In place of Lord Bassanio and my selfe.<br>

So far you well till we shall meete againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06433"> Lor. Faire thoughts &amp; happy houres attend on you</p><br>

<p id="id06434"> Iessi. I wish your Ladiship all hearts content</p><br>

<p id="id06435">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I thanke you for your wish, and am well pleas'd<br>

To wish it backe on you: faryouwell Iessica.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06436">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06437">Now Balthaser, as I haue euer found thee honest true,<br>

So let me finde thee still: take this same letter,<br>

And vse thou all the indeauor of a man,<br>

In speed to Mantua, see thou render this<br>

Into my cosins hand, Doctor Belario,<br>

And looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee,<br>

Bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed<br>

Vnto the Tranect, to the common Ferrie<br>

Which trades to Venice; waste no time in words,<br>

But get thee gone, I shall be there before thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06438"> Balth. Madam, I goe with all conuenient speed</p><br>

<p id="id06439">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Come on Nerissa, I haue worke in hand<br>

That you yet know not of; wee'll see our husbands<br>

Before they thinke of vs?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerrissa. Shall they see vs?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Portia. They shall Nerrissa: but in such a habit,<br>

That they shall thinke we are accomplished<br>

With that we lacke; Ile hold thee any wager<br>

When we are both accoutered like yong men,<br>

Ile proue the prettier fellow of the two,<br>

And weare my dagger with the brauer grace,<br>

And speake betweene the change of man and boy,<br>

With a reede voyce, and turne two minsing steps<br>

Into a manly stride; and speake of frayes<br>

Like a fine bragging youth: and tell quaint lyes<br>

How honourable Ladies sought my loue,<br>

Which I denying, they fell sicke and died.<br>

I could not doe withall: then Ile repent,<br>

And wish for all that, that I had not kil'd them;<br>

And twentie of these punie lies Ile tell,<br>

That men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole<br>

Aboue a twelue moneth: I haue within my minde<br>

A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks,<br>

Which I will practise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06440">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerris. Why, shall wee turne to men?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Portia. Fie, what a questions that?<br>

If thou wert nere a lewd interpreter:<br>

But come, Ile tell thee all my whole deuice<br>

When I am in my coach, which stayes for vs<br>

At the Parke gate; and therefore haste away,<br>

For we must measure twentie miles to day.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06441">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id06442">Enter Clowne and Iessica.</p><br>

<p id="id06443"> Clown. Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Father
are to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise
you, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so
now I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of
good cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is
but one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is
but a kinde of bastard hope neither</p><br>

<p id="id06444">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father<br>

got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06445">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the<br>

sins of my mother should be visited vpon me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06446"> Clow. Truly then I feare you are damned both by father
and mother: thus when I shun Scilla your father, I
fall into Charibdis your mother; well, you are gone both
waies</p><br>

<p id="id06447" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ies. I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me
a Christian</p><br>

<p id="id06448"> Clow. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians
enow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by another:
this making of Christians will raise the price of
Hogs, if wee grow all to be porke-eaters, wee shall not
shortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.
Enter Lorenzo.</p><br>

<p id="id06449" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Ies. Ile tell my husband Lancelet what you say, heere
he comes</p><br>

<p id="id06450"> Loren. I shall grow iealous of you shortly Lancelet,
if you thus get my wife into corners?
 Ies. Nay, you need not feare vs Lorenzo, Launcelet
and I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee
in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies
you are no good member of the common wealth, for
in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price
of Porke</p><br>

<p id="id06451"> Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,
than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:
the Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?
 Clow. It is much that the Moore should be more then
reason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is
indeed more then I tooke her for</p><br>

<p id="id06452"> Loren. How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I
thinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into silence,
and discourse grow commendable in none onely
but Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?
 Clow. That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?
 Loren. Goodly Lord, what a witte-snapper are you,
then bid them prepare dinner</p><br>

<p id="id06453"> Clow. That is done to sir, onely couer is the word</p><br>

<p id="id06454">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. Will you couer than sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. Not so sir neither, I know my dutie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06455"> Loren. Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou
shew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray
thee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe
to thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the
meat, and we will come in to dinner</p><br>

<p id="id06456"> Clow. For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the
meat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to
dinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall gouerne.</p><br>

<p id="id06457">Exit Clowne.</p><br>

<p id="id06458">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. O deare discretion, how his words are suted,<br>

The foole hath planted in his memory<br>

An Armie of good words, and I doe know<br>

A many fooles that stand in better place,<br>

Garnisht like him, that for a tricksie word<br>

Defie the matter: how cheer'st thou Iessica,<br>

And now good sweet say thy opinion,<br>

How dost thou like the Lord Bassiano's wife?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iessi. Past all expressing, it is very meete<br>

The Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life<br>

For hauing such a blessing in his Lady,<br>

He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,<br>

And if on earth he doe not meane it, it<br>

Is reason he should neuer come to heauen?<br>

Why, if two gods should play some heauenly match,<br>

And on the wager lay two earthly women,<br>

And Portia one: there must be something else<br>

Paund with the other, for the poore rude world<br>

Hath not her fellow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06459">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. Euen such a husband<br>

Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06460">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. Nay, but aske my opinion to of that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. Nay, let me praise you while I haue a stomacke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. No pray thee, let it serue for table talke,<br>

Then how som ere thou speakst 'mong other things,<br>

I shall digest it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iessi. Well, Ile set you forth.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Ready, so please your grace?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answere<br>

A stonie aduersary, an inhumane wretch,<br>

Vncapable of pitty, voyd, and empty<br>

From any dram of mercie<br>

Your Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie<br>

His rigorous course: but since he stands obdurate,<br>

And that no lawful meanes can carrie me<br>

Out of his enuies reach, I do oppose<br>

My patience to his fury, and am arm'd<br>

To suffer with a quietnesse of spirit,<br>

Shylocke the world thinkes, and I thinke so to<br>

That thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice<br>

To the last houre of act, and then 'tis thought<br>

Thou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse more strange,<br>

Than is thy strange apparant cruelty;<br>

And where thou now exact'st the penalty,<br>

Which is a pound of this poore Merchants flesh,<br>

Thou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture,<br>

But touch'd with humane gentlenesse and loue:<br>

Forgiue a moytie of the principall,<br>

Glancing an eye of pitty on his losses<br>

That haue of late so hudled on his backe,<br>

Enow to presse a royall Merchant downe;<br>

And plucke commiseration of his state<br>

From brassie bosomes, and rough hearts of flints,<br>

From stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind<br>

To offices of tender curtesie,<br>

We all expect a gentle answer Iew?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. I haue possest your grace of what I purpose,<br>

And by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne<br>

To haue the due and forfeit of my bond.<br>

If you denie it, let the danger light<br>

Vpon your Charter, and your Cities freedome.<br>

You'l aske me why I rather choose to haue<br>

A weight of carrion flesh, then to receiue<br>

Three thousand Ducats? Ile not answer that:<br>

But say it is my humor; Is it answered?<br>

What if my house be troubled with a Rat,<br>

And I be pleas'd to giue ten thousand Ducates<br>

To haue it bain'd? What, are you answer'd yet?<br>

Some men there are loue not a gaping Pigge:<br>

Some that are mad, if they behold a Cat:<br>

And others, when the bag-pipe sings i'th nose,<br>

Cannot containe their Vrine for affection.<br>

Masters of passion swayes it to the moode<br>

Of what it likes or loaths, now for your answer:<br>

As there is no firme reason to be rendred<br>

Why he cannot abide a gaping Pigge?<br>

Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?<br>

Why he a woollen bag-pipe: but of force<br>

Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame,<br>

As to offend himselfe being offended:<br>

So can I giue no reason, nor I will not,<br>

More then a lodg'd hate, and a certaine loathing<br>

I beare Anthonio, that I follow thus<br>

A loosing suite against him? Are you answered?<br>

<p id="id06469"> Iew. I am not bound to please thee with my answer</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Euerie offence is not a hate at first<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I pray you thinke you question with the Iew:<br>

You may as well go stand vpon the beach,<br>

And bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height,<br>

Or euen as well vse question with the Wolfe,<br>

The Ewe bleate for the Lambe:<br>

You may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines<br>

To wagge their high tops, and to make no noise<br>

When they are fretted with the gusts of heauen:<br>

You may as well do any thing most hard,<br>

As seeke to soften that, then which what harder?<br>

His Iewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you<br>

Make no more offers, vse no farther meanes,<br>

But with all briefe and plaine conueniencie<br>

Let me haue iudgement, and the Iew his will<br>

I would not draw them, I would haue my bond?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. How shalt thou hope for mercie, rendring none?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong?<br>

You haue among you many a purchast slaue,<br>

Which like your Asses, and your Dogs and Mules,<br>

You vse in abiect and in slauish parts,<br>

Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,<br>

Let them be free, marrie them to your heires?<br>

Why sweate they vnder burthens? Let their beds<br>

Be made as soft as yours: and let their pallats<br>

Be season'd with such Viands: you will answer<br>

The slaues are ours. So do I answer you.<br>

The pound of flesh which I demand of him<br>

Is deerely bought, 'tis mine, and I will haue it.<br>

If you deny me; fie vpon your Law,<br>

There is no force in the decrees of Venice;<br>

I stand for iudgement, answer, Shall I haue it?<br>

The Iew shall haue my flesh, blood, bones, and all,<br>

Ere thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood<br>

Thou mak'st thy knife keene: but no mettall can,<br>

No, not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse<br>

Of thy sharpe enuy. Can no prayers pierce thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make<br>

And for thy life let iustice be accus'd:<br>

Thou almost mak'st me wauer in my faith;<br>

That soules of Animals infuse themselues<br>

Into the trunkes of men. Thy currish spirit<br>

Gouern'd a Wolfe, who hang'd for humane slaughter,<br>

Euen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet;<br>

And whil'st thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam,<br>

Infus'd it selfe in thee: For thy desires<br>

Are Woluish, bloody, steru'd, and rauenous<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06482">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond<br>

Thou but offend'st thy Lungs to speake so loud:<br>

Repaire thy wit good youth, or it will fall<br>

To endlesse ruine. I stand heere for Law<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06483">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. This Letter from Bellario doth commend<br>

A yong and Learned Doctor in our Court;<br>

Where is he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. He attendeth heere hard by<br>

To know your answer, whether you'l admit him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06484"> Du. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go giue him curteous conduct to this place,
Meane time the Court shall heare Bellarioes Letter.
Your Grace shall vnderstand, that at the receite of your
Letter I am very sicke: but in the instant that your messenger
came, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Doctor
of Rome, his name is Balthasar: I acquainted him with
the cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and Anthonio
the Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is
furnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne learning,
the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
with him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in
my sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment
to let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so
yong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.
Enter Portia for Balthazar.</p><br>

<p id="id06485">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. You heare the learn'd Bellario what he writes,<br>

And heere (I take it) is the Doctor come.<br>

Giue me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I did my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06486">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. You are welcome: take your place;<br>

Are you acquainted with the difference<br>

That holds this present question in the Court<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06487">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I am enformed throughly of the cause.<br>

Which is the Merchant heere? and which the Iew?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Anthonio and old Shylocke, both stand forth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06488">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Is your name Shylocke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. Shylocke is my name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06489">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Of a strange nature is the sute you follow,<br>

Yet in such rule, that the Venetian Law<br>

Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.<br>

You stand within his danger, do you not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I, so he sayes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06490">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Do you confesse the bond?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I do<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06491"> Por. Then must the Iew be mercifull</p><br>

<p id="id06492"> Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that</p><br>

<p id="id06493">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,<br>

It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen<br>

Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,<br>

It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,<br>

'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes<br>

The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.<br>

His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,<br>

The attribute to awe and Maiestie,<br>

Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:<br>

But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,<br>

It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,<br>

It is an attribute to God himselfe;<br>

And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods<br>

When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,<br>

Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,<br>

That in the course of Iustice, none of vs<br>

Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,<br>

And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render<br>

The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much<br>

To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:<br>

Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice<br>

Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06494">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,<br>

The penaltie and forfeite of my bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06495">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,<br>

Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,<br>

I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,<br>

On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:<br>

If this will not suffice, it must appeare<br>

That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you<br>

Wrest once the Law to your authority.<br>

To do a great right, do a little wrong,<br>

And curbe this cruell diuell of his will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06496">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. It must not be, there is no power in Venice<br>

Can alter a decree established:<br>

'Twill be recorded for a President,<br>

And many an error by the same example,<br>

Will rush into the state: It cannot be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06497">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. A Daniel come to iudgement, yea a Daniel.<br>

O wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06498"> Por. I pray you let me looke vpon the bond</p><br>

<p id="id06499"> Iew. Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is</p><br>

<p id="id06500"> Por. Shylocke, there's thrice thy monie offered thee</p><br>

<p id="id06501">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:<br>

Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule?<br>

No not for Venice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06502">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Why this bond is forfeit,<br>

And lawfully by this the Iew may claime<br>

A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br>

Neerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,<br>

Take thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06503">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. When it is paid according to the tenure.<br>

It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:<br>

You know the Law, your exposition<br>

Hath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,<br>

Whereof you are a well-deseruing pillar,<br>

Proceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,<br>

There is no power in the tongue of man<br>

To alter me: I stay heere on my bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06504">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. Most heartily I do beseech the Court<br>

To giue the iudgement<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06505">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Why then thus it is:<br>

You must prepare your bosome for his knife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06506"> Iew. O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man</p><br>

<p id="id06507">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. For the intent and purpose of the Law<br>

Hath full relation to the penaltie,<br>

Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06508">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,<br>

How much more elder art thou then thy lookes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Therefore lay bare your bosome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06509">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. I, his brest,<br>

So sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?<br>

Neerest his heart, those are the very words<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06510">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the<br>

flesh?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. I haue them ready<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06511">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge<br>

To stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06512">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. It is not nominated in the bond?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. It is not so exprest: but what of that?<br>

'Twere good you do so much for charitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06513"> Iew. I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond</p><br>

<p id="id06514">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.<br>

Giue me your hand Bassanio, fare you well.<br>

Greeue not that I am falne to this for you:<br>

For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde<br>

Then is her custome. It is still her vse<br>

To let the wretched man out-liue his wealth,<br>

To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow<br>

An age of pouerty. From which lingring penance<br>

Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:<br>

Commend me to your honourable Wife,<br>

Tell her the processe of Anthonio's end:<br>

Say how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:<br>

And when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,<br>

Whether Bassanio had not once a Loue:<br>

Repent not you that you shall loose your friend,<br>

And he repents not that he payes your debt.<br>

For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,<br>

Ile pay it instantly, with all my heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06515">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Anthonio, I am married to a wife,<br>

Which is as deere to me as life it selfe,<br>

But life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,<br>

Are not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.<br>

I would loose all, I sacrifice them all<br>

Heere to this deuill, to deliuer you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06516">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Your wife would giue you little thanks for that<br>

If she were by to heare you make the offer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06517">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,<br>

I would she were in heauen, so she could<br>

Intreat some power to change this currish Iew<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06518">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,<br>

The wish would make else an vnquiet house<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06519">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daughter<br>

Would any of the stocke of Barrabas<br>

Had beene her husband, rather then a Christian.<br>

We trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06520">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,<br>

The Court awards it, and the law doth giue it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06521"> Iew. Most rightfull Iudge</p><br>

<p id="id06522">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,<br>

The Law allowes it, and the Court awards it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06523"> Iew. Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare</p><br>

<p id="id06524">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Tarry a little, there is something else,<br>

This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,<br>

The words expresly are a pound of flesh:<br>

Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,<br>

But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br>

One drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods<br>

Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate<br>

Vnto the state of Venice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06525">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. O vpright Iudge,<br>

Marke Iew, o learned Iudge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06526">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Is that the law?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Thy selfe shalt see the Act:<br>

For as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd<br>

Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06527"> Gra. O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge</p><br>

<p id="id06528">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iew. I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,<br>

And let the Christian goe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06529"> Bass. Heere is the money</p><br>

<p id="id06530">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,<br>

He shall haue nothing but the penalty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06531"> Gra. O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge</p><br>

<p id="id06532">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,<br>

Shed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more<br>

But iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more<br>

Or lesse then a iust pound, be it so much<br>

As makes it light or heauy in the substance,<br>

Or the deuision of the twentieth part<br>

Of one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne<br>

But in the estimation of a hayre,<br>

Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06533">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel Iew,<br>

Now infidell I haue thee on the hip<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06534"> Por. Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture</p><br>

<p id="id06535"> Shy. Giue me my principall, and let me goe</p><br>

<p id="id06536"> Bass. I haue it ready for thee, heere it is</p><br>

<p id="id06537">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. He hath refus'd it in the open Court,<br>

He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06538">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel,<br>

I thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06539">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Shall I not haue barely my principall?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture,<br>

To be taken so at thy perill Iew<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06540">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Why then the Deuill giue him good of it:<br>

Ile stay no longer question<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06541">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Tarry Iew,<br>

The Law hath yet another hold on you.<br>

It is enacted in the Lawes of Venice,<br>

If it be proued against an Alien,<br>

That by direct, or indirect attempts<br>

He seeke the life of any Citizen,<br>

The party gainst the which he doth contriue,<br>

Shall seaze one halfe his goods, the other halfe<br>

Comes to the priuie coffer of the State,<br>

And the offenders life lies in the mercy<br>

Of the Duke onely, gainst all other voice.<br>

In which predicament I say thou standst:<br>

For it appeares by manifest proceeding,<br>

That indirectly, and directly to,<br>

Thou hast contriu'd against the very life<br>

Of the defendant: and thou hast incur'd<br>

The danger formerly by me rehearst.<br>

Downe therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06542">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,<br>

And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<br>

Thou hast not left the value of a cord,<br>

Therefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06543">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,<br>

I pardon thee thy life before thou aske it:<br>

For halfe thy wealth, it is Anthonio's<br>

The other halfe comes to the generall state,<br>

Which humblenesse may driue vnto a fine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06544"> Por. I for the state, not for Anthonio</p><br>

<p id="id06545">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that,<br>

You take my house, when you do take the prop<br>

That doth sustaine my house: you take my life<br>

When you doe take the meanes whereby I liue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06546">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. What mercy can you render him Anthonio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. A halter gratis, nothing else for Gods sake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06547">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. So please my Lord the Duke, and all the Court<br>

To quit the fine for one halfe of his goods,<br>

I am content: so he will let me haue<br>

The other halfe in vse, to render it<br>

Vpon his death, vnto the Gentleman<br>

That lately stole his daughter.<br>

Two things prouided more, that for this fauour<br>

He presently become a Christian:<br>

The other, that he doe record a gift<br>

Heere in the Court of all he dies possest<br>

Vnto his sonne Lorenzo, and his daughter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06548">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. He shall doe this, or else I doe recant<br>

The pardon that I late pronounced heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06549">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Art thou contented Iew? what dost thou say?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I am content<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06550"> Por. Clarke, draw a deed of gift</p><br>

<p id="id06551">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy. I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence,<br>

I am not well, send the deed after me,<br>

And I will signe it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06552"> Duke. Get thee gone, but doe it</p><br>

<p id="id06553">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers,<br>

Had I been iudge, thou shouldst haue had ten more,<br>

To bring thee to the gallowes, not to the font.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06554"> Du. Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner</p><br>

<p id="id06555">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I humbly doe desire your Grace of pardon,<br>

I must away this night toward Padua,<br>

And it is meete I presently set forth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06556">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I am sorry that your leysure serues you not:<br>

Anthonio, gratifie this gentleman,<br>

For in my minde you are much bound to him.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06557">Exit Duke and his traine.</p><br>

<p id="id06558">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend<br>

Haue by your wisedome beene this day acquitted<br>

Of greeuous penalties, in lieu whereof,<br>

Three thousand Ducats due vnto the Iew<br>

We freely cope your curteous paines withall<br>

<p id="id06559">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. And stand indebted ouer and aboue<br>

In loue and seruice to you euermore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06560">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. He is well paid that is well satisfied,<br>

And I deliuering you, am satisfied,<br>

And therein doe account my selfe well paid,<br>

My minde was neuer yet more mercinarie.<br>

I pray you know me when we meete againe,<br>

I wish you well, and so I take my leaue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06561">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Deare sir, of force I must attempt you further,<br>

Take some remembrance of vs as a tribute,<br>

Not as fee: grant me two things, I pray you<br>

Not to denie me, and to pardon me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06562">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. You presse mee farre, and therefore I will yeeld,<br>

Giue me your gloues, Ile weare them for your sake,<br>

And for your loue Ile take this ring from you,<br>

Doe not draw backe your hand, ile take no more,<br>

And you in loue shall not deny me this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. This ring good sir, alas it is a trifle,<br>

I will not shame my selfe to giue you this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06563">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I wil haue nothing else but onely this,<br>

And now methinkes I haue a minde to it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06564">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. There's more depends on this then on the valew,<br>

The dearest ring in Venice will I giue you,<br>

And finde it out by proclamation,<br>

Onely for this I pray you pardon me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06565">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I see sir you are liberall in offers,<br>

You taught me first to beg, and now me thinkes<br>

You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06566">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Good sir, this ring was giuen me by my wife,<br>

And when she put it on, she made me vow<br>

That I should neither sell, nor giue, nor lose it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06567">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. That scuse serues many men to saue their gifts,<br>

And if your wife be not a mad woman,<br>

And know how well I haue deseru'd this ring,<br>

Shee would not hold out enemy for euer<br>

For giuing it to me: well, peace be with you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06568">Exeunt.</p><br>

Let his deseruings and my loue withall<br>

Be valued against your wiues commandement<br>

<p id="id06575">&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Enquire the Iewes house out, giue him this deed,<br>

And let him signe it, wee'll away to night,<br>

And be a day before our husbands home:<br>

This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.<br>

Enter Gratiano.<br>

My L[ord]. Bassanio vpon more aduice,<br>

Hath sent you heere this ring, and doth intreat<br>

Your company at dinner<br>

And so I pray you tell him: furthermore,<br>

That they did giue the rings away to men;<br>

But weele out-face them, and out-sweare them to:<br>

Away, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry<br>

<p id="id06585">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. The moone shines bright. In such a night as this,<br>

When the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees,<br>

And they did make no noyse, in such a night<br>

Troylus me thinkes mounted the Troian walls,<br>

And sigh'd his soule toward the Grecian tents<br>

Where Cressed lay that night<br>
</p><br>

And with an Vnthrift Loue did runne from Venice,<br>

As farre as Belmont<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06590">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ies. In such a night<br>

Did young Lorenzo sweare he lou'd her well,<br>

Stealing her soule with many vowes of faith,<br>

And nere a true one<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06591">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. In such a night<br>

Did pretty Iessica (like a little shrow)<br>

Slander her Loue, and he forgaue it her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06592">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iessi. I would out-night you did no body come:<br>

But harke, I heare the footing of a man.<br>

Enter Messenger.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06593">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. A friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06594">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. A friend, what friend? your name I pray you friend?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. Stephano is my name, and I bring word<br>

My Mistresse will before the breake of day<br>

Be heere at Belmont, she doth stray about<br>

By holy crosses where she kneeles and prayes<br>

For happy wedlocke houres<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06595">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. Who comes with her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. None but a holy Hermit and her maid:<br>

I pray you is my Master yet return'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. He is not, nor we haue not heard from him,<br>

But goe we in I pray thee Iessica,<br>

And ceremoniously let vs prepare<br>

Some welcome for the Mistresse of the house,<br>

Enter Clowne.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06596"> Clo. Sola, sola: wo ha ho, sola, sola</p><br>

<p id="id06597">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. Who calls?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Sola, did you see M[aster]. Lorenzo, &amp; M[aster]. Lorenzo,<br>

sola,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Leaue hollowing man, heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06598">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Sola, where, where?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Tel him ther's a Post come from my Master, with<br>

his horne full of good newes, my Master will be here ere<br>

morning sweete soule<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06599">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. Let's in, and there expect their comming.<br>

And yet no matter: why should we goe in?<br>

My friend Stephen, signifie pray you<br>

Within the house, your Mistresse is at hand,<br>

And bring your musique foorth into the ayre.<br>

How sweet the moone-light sleepes vpon this banke,<br>

Heere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke<br>

Creepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night<br>

Become the tutches of sweet harmonie:<br>

Sit Iessica, looke how the floore of heauen<br>

Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,<br>

There's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst<br>

But in his motion like an Angell sings,<br>

Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;<br>

Such harmonie is in immortall soules,<br>

But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>

Doth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:<br>

Come hoe, and wake Diana with a hymne,<br>

With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,<br>

And draw her home with musicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06600"> Iessi. I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.</p><br>

<p id="id06601">Play musicke.</p><br>

<p id="id06602">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:<br>

For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard<br>

Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts,<br>

Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>

Which is the hot condition of their bloud,<br>

If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,<br>

Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares,<br>

You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,<br>

Their sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,<br>

By the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet<br>

Did faine that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods.<br>

Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br>

But musicke for time doth change his nature,<br>

The man that hath no musicke in himselfe,<br>

Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,<br>

Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,<br>

The motions of his spirit are dull as night,<br>

And his affections darke as Erobus,<br>

Let no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.<br>

Enter Portia and Nerrissa.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06603">&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. That light we see is burning in my hall:<br>

How farre that little candell throwes his beames,<br>

So shines a good deed in a naughty world<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06604">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. When the moone shone we did not see the candle?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,<br>

A substitute shines brightly as a King<br>

Vntill a King be by, and then his state<br>

Empties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke<br>

Into the maine of waters: musique, harke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06605">Musicke.</p><br>

<p id="id06606"> Ner. It is your musicke Madame of the house</p><br>

<p id="id06607">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Nothing is good I see without respect,<br>

Methinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06608">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke<br>

When neither is attended: and I thinke<br>

The Nightingale if she should sing by day<br>

When euery Goose is cackling, would be thought<br>

No better a Musitian then the Wren?<br>

How many things by season, season'd are<br>

To their right praise, and true perfection:<br>

Peace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,<br>

And would not be awak'd.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06609">Musicke ceases.</p><br>

<p id="id06610">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. That is the voice,<br>

Or I am much deceiu'd of Portia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06611">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the<br>

Cuckow by the bad voice?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Deere Lady welcome home?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare<br>

Which speed we hope the better for our words,<br>

Are they return'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Madam, they are not yet:<br>

But there is come a Messenger before<br>

To signifie their comming<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06612">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Go in Nerrissa,<br>

Giue order to my seruants, that they take<br>

No note at all of our being absent hence,<br>

Nor you Lorenzo, Iessica nor you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06613">A Tucket sounds.</p><br>

<p id="id06614">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor. Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,<br>

We are no tell-tales Madam, feare you not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06615">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,<br>

It lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,<br>

Such as the day is, when the Sun is hid.<br>

Enter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06616">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. We should hold day with the Antipodes,<br>

If you would walke in absence of the sunne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06617">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Let me giue light, but let me not be light,<br>

For a light wife doth make a heauie husband,<br>

And neuer be Bassanio so for me,<br>

But God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06618">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend<br>

This is the man, this is Anthonio,<br>

To whom I am so infinitely bound<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06619">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. You should in all sence be much bound to him,<br>

For as I heare he was much bound for you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06620"> Anth. No more then I am wel acquitted of</p><br>

<p id="id06621">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:<br>

It must appeare in other waies then words,<br>

Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06622">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,<br>

Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,<br>

Would he were gelt that had it for my part,<br>

Since you do take it Loue so much at hart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06623">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring<br>

That she did giue me, whose Poesie was<br>

For all the world like Cutlers Poetry<br>

Vpon a knife; Loue mee, and leaue mee not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06624">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:<br>

You swore to me when I did giue it you,<br>

That you would weare it til the houre of death,<br>

And that it should lye with you in your graue,<br>

Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br>

You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.<br>

Gaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know<br>

The Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06625"> Gra. He wil, and if he liue to be a man</p><br>

<p id="id06626"> Nerrissa. I, if a Woman liue to be a man</p><br>

<p id="id06627">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,<br>

A kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,<br>

No higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,<br>

A prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,<br>

I could not for my heart deny it him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06628">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. You were too blame, I must be plaine with you,<br>

To part so slightly with your wiues first gift,<br>

A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,<br>

And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.<br>

I gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare<br>

Neuer to part with it, and heere he stands:<br>

I dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,<br>

Nor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth<br>

That the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,<br>

You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,<br>

And 'twere to me I should be mad at it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06629">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Why I were best to cut my left hand off,<br>

And sweare I lost the Ring defending it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06630">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away<br>

Vnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede<br>

Deseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke<br>

That tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,<br>

And neyther man nor master would take ought<br>

But the two Rings<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06631">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. What Ring gaue you my Lord?<br>

Not that I hope which you receiu'd of me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06632">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,<br>

I would deny it: but you see my finger<br>

Hath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06633">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.<br>

By heauen I wil nere come in your bed<br>

Vntil I see the Ring<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06634"> Ner. Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine</p><br>

<p id="id06635">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Sweet Portia,<br>

If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,<br>

If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,<br>

And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,<br>

And how vnwillingly I left the Ring,<br>

When nought would be accepted but the Ring,<br>

You would abate the strength of your displeasure?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,<br>

Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,<br>

Or your owne honour to containe the Ring,<br>

You would not then haue parted with the Ring:<br>

What man is there so much vnreasonable,<br>

If you had pleas'd to haue defended it<br>

With any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie<br>

To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:<br>

Nerrissa teaches me what to beleeue,<br>

Ile die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. No by mine honor Madam, by my soule<br>

No Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,<br>

Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,<br>

And beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,<br>

And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:<br>

Euen he that had held vp the verie life<br>

Of my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?<br>

I was inforc'd to send it after him,<br>

I was beset with shame and curtesie,<br>

My honor would not let ingratitude<br>

So much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,<br>

And by these blessed Candles of the night,<br>

Had you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd<br>

The Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,<br>

Since he hath got the iewell that I loued,<br>

And that which you did sweare to keepe for me,<br>

I will become as liberall as you,<br>

Ile not deny him any thing I haue,<br>

No, not my body, nor my husbands bed:<br>

Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.<br>

Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,<br>

If you doe not, if I be left alone,<br>

Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne,<br>

Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06636">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerrissa. And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd<br>

How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06637">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,<br>

For if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06638"> Ant. I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels</p><br>

<p id="id06639">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Sir, grieue not you,<br>

You are welcome notwithstanding<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06640">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Portia, forgiue me this enforced wrong,<br>

And in the hearing of these manie friends<br>

I sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes<br>

Wherein I see my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06641">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Marke you but that?<br>

In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:<br>

In each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,<br>

And there's an oath of credit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06642">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bas. Nay, but heare me.<br>

Pardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare<br>

I neuer more will breake an oath with thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06643">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anth. I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,<br>

Which but for him that had your husbands ring<br>

Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,<br>

My soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord<br>

Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06644">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,<br>

And bid him keepe it better then the other<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06645"> Ant. Heere Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring</p><br>

<p id="id06646"> Bass. By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor</p><br>

<p id="id06647">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. I had it of him: pardon Bassanio,<br>

For by this ring the Doctor lay with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06648">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. And pardon me my gentle Gratiano,<br>

For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke<br>

In liew of this, last night did lye with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06649">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Why this is like the mending of high waies<br>

In Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:<br>

What, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06650">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;<br>

Heere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,<br>

It comes from Padua from Bellario,<br>

There you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor,<br>

Nerrissa there her Clarke. Lorenzo heere<br>

Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,<br>

And but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet<br>

Entred my house. Anthonio you are welcome,<br>

And I haue better newes in store for you<br>

Then you expect: vnseale this letter soone,<br>

There you shall finde three of your Argosies<br>

Are richly come to harbour sodainlie.<br>

You shall not know by what strange accident<br>

I chanced on this letter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06651"> Antho. I am dumbe</p><br>

<p id="id06652">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06653">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,<br>

Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06654">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass. (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,<br>

When I am absent, then lie with my wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06655">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life &amp; liuing;<br>

For heere I reade for certaine that my ships<br>

Are safelie come to Rode<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06656">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. How now Lorenzo?<br>

My Clarke hath some good comforts to for you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06657">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner. I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.<br>

There doe I giue to you and Iessica<br>

From the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift<br>

After his death, of all he dies possess'd of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06658">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren. Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way<br>

Of starued people<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06659">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. It is almost morning,<br>

And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br>

Of these euents at full. Let vs goe in,<br>

And charge vs there vpon intergatories,<br>

And we will answer all things faithfully<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06660">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gra. Let it be so, the first intergatory<br>

That my Nerrissa shall be sworne on, is,<br>

Whether till the next night she had rather stay,<br>

Or goe to bed, now being two houres to day,<br>

But were the day come, I should wish it darke,<br>

Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.<br>

Well, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing<br>

So sore, as keeping safe Nerrissas ring.<br>

<p id="id06665">Enter Orlando and Adam.</p><br>

<p id="id06666"> Orlando. As I remember Adam, it was vpon this fashion
bequeathed me by will, but poore a thousand
Crownes, and as thou saist, charged my brother
on his blessing to breed mee well: and
there begins my sadnesse: My brother Iaques he keepes
at schoole, and report speakes goldenly of his profit:
for my part, he keepes me rustically at home, or (to speak
more properly) staies me heere at home vnkept: for call
you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs
not from the stalling of an Oxe? his horses are bred
better, for besides that they are faire with their feeding,
they are taught their mannage, and to that end Riders
deerely hir'd: but I (his brother) gaine nothing vnder
him but growth, for the which his Animals on his
dunghils are as much bound to him as I: besides this nothing
that he so plentifully giues me, the something that
nature gaue mee, his countenance seemes to take from
me: hee lets mee feede with his Hindes, barres mee the
place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my
gentility with my education. This is it Adam that
grieues me, and the spirit of my Father, which I thinke
is within mee, begins to mutinie against this seruitude.
I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise
remedy how to auoid it.
Enter Oliuer.</p><br>

<p id="id06667"> Adam. Yonder comes my Master, your brother</p><br>

know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition
of bloud you should so know me: the courtesie of
nations allowes you my better, in that you are the first
borne, but the same tradition takes not away my bloud,
were there twenty brothers betwixt vs: I haue as much
of my father in mee, as you, albeit I confesse your comming

father charg'd you in his will to giue me good education:
you haue train'd me like a pezant, obscuring and

of my father growes strong in mee, and I will no longer

father left me by testament, with that I will goe buy my

crownes neyther: holla Dennis.
Enter Dennis.</p><br>

<p id="id06686">&nbsp;&nbsp;Den. Calls your worship?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Was not Charles the Dukes Wrastler heere to<br>

speake with me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Den. So please you, he is heere at the doore, and importunes<br>

accesse to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06687">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Call him in: 'twill be a good way: and to morrow<br>

the wrastling is.<br>

Enter Charles.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06688"> Cha. Good morrow to your worship</p><br>

<p id="id06689"> Oli. Good Mounsier Charles: what's the new newes
at the new Court?
 Charles. There's no newes at the Court Sir, but the
olde newes: that is, the old Duke is banished by his yonger
brother the new Duke, and three or foure louing
Lords haue put themselues into voluntary exile with
him, whose lands and reuenues enrich the new Duke,
therefore he giues them good leaue to wander</p><br>

<p id="id06690"> Oli. Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter bee
banished with her Father?
 Cha. O no; for the Dukes daughter her Cosen so
loues her, being euer from their Cradles bred together,
that hee would haue followed her exile, or haue died to
stay behind her; she is at the Court, and no lesse beloued
of her Vncle, then his owne daughter, and neuer two Ladies
loued as they doe</p><br>

<p id="id06691"> Oli. Where will the old Duke liue?
 Cha. They say hee is already in the Forrest of Arden,
and a many merry men with him; and there they liue
like the old Robin Hood of England: they say many yong
Gentlemen flocke to him euery day, and fleet the time
carelesly as they did in the golden world</p><br>

<p id="id06692">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. What, you wrastle to morrow before the new<br>

Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06693"> Cha. Marry doe I sir: and I came to acquaint you
with a matter: I am giuen sir secretly to vnderstand, that
your yonger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come
in disguis'd against mee to try a fall: to morrow sir I
wrastle for my credit, and hee that escapes me without
some broken limbe, shall acquit him well: your brother
is but young and tender, and for your loue I would bee
loth to foyle him, as I must for my owne honour if hee
come in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither
to acquaint you withall, that either you might stay him
from his intendment, or brooke such disgrace well as he
shall runne into, in that it is a thing of his owne search,
and altogether against my will</p><br>

<p id="id06694"> Oli. Charles , I thanke thee for thy loue to me, which
thou shalt finde I will most kindly requite: I had my
selfe notice of my Brothers purpose heerein, and haue by
vnder-hand meanes laboured to disswade him from it;
but he is resolute. Ile tell thee Charles, it is the stubbornest
yong fellow of France, full of ambition, an enuious
emulator of euery mans good parts, a secret &amp; villanous
contriuer against mee his naturall brother: therefore vse
thy discretion, I had as liefe thou didst breake his necke
as his finger. And thou wert best looke to't; for if thou
dost him any slight disgrace, or if hee doe not mightilie
grace himselfe on thee, hee will practise against thee by
poyson, entrap thee by some treacherous deuise, and neuer
leaue thee till he hath tane thy life by some indirect
meanes or other: for I assure thee, (and almost with
teares I speake it) there is not one so young, and so villanous
this day liuing. I speake but brotherly of him,
but should I anathomize him to thee, as hee is, I must
blush, and weepe, and thou must looke pale and
wonder</p><br>

<p id="id06695"> Cha. I am heartily glad I came hither to you: if hee
come to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee
goe alone againe, Ile neuer wrastle for prize more: and
so God keepe your worship.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id06696">Farewell good Charles. Now will I stirre this Gamester:
I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soule (yet
I know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet hee's
gentle, neuer school'd, and yet learned, full of noble
deuise, of all sorts enchantingly beloued, and indeed
so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my
owne people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall
cleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy
thither, which now Ile goe about.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id06697" style="margin-top: 2em">Scoena Secunda.</p><br>

<p id="id06698">Enter Rosalind, and Cellia.</p><br>

<p id="id06699"> Cel. I pray thee Rosalind, sweet my Coz, be merry</p><br>

<p id="id06700"> Ros. Deere Cellia; I show more mirth then I am mistresse
of, and would you yet were merrier: vnlesse you
could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learne mee how to remember any extraordinary pleasure</p><br>

<p id="id06701"> Cel. Heerein I see thou lou'st mee not with the full
waight that I loue thee; if my Vncle thy banished father
had banished thy Vncle the Duke my Father, so thou
hadst beene still with mee, I could haue taught my loue
to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth
of thy loue to me were so righteously temper'd, as mine
is to thee</p><br>

<p id="id06702" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ros. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate,
to reioyce in yours</p><br>

<p id="id06703"> Cel. You know my Father hath no childe, but I, nor
none is like to haue; and truely when he dies, thou shalt
be his heire; for what hee hath taken away from thy father
perforce, I will render thee againe in affection: by
mine honor I will, and when I breake that oath, let mee
turne monster: therefore my sweet Rose, my deare Rose,
be merry</p><br>

<p id="id06704"> Ros. From henceforth I will Coz, and deuise sports:
let me see, what thinke you of falling in Loue?
 Cel. Marry I prethee doe, to make sport withall: but
loue no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neyther,
then with safety of a pure blush, thou maist in honor
come off againe</p><br>

<p id="id06705">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. What shall be our sport then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Let vs sit and mocke the good houswife Fortune<br>

from her wheele, that her gifts may henceforth bee<br>

bestowed equally<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06706"> Ros. I would wee could doe so: for her benefits are
mightily misplaced, and the bountifull blinde woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women</p><br>

<p id="id06707"> Cel. 'Tis true, for those that she makes faire, she scarce
makes honest, &amp; those that she makes honest, she makes
very illfauouredly</p><br>

<p id="id06708">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures:<br>

Fortune reignes in gifts of the world, not in the<br>

lineaments of Nature.<br>

Enter Clowne.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06709"> Cel. No; when Nature hath made a faire creature,
may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? though nature
hath giuen vs wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune
sent in this foole to cut off the argument?
 Ros. Indeed there is fortune too hard for nature, when
fortune makes natures naturall, the cutter off of natures
witte</p><br>

<p id="id06710"> Cel. Peraduenture this is not Fortunes work neither,
but Natures, who perceiueth our naturall wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this Naturall for
our whetstone: for alwaies the dulnesse of the foole, is
the whetstone of the wits. How now Witte, whether
wander you?
 Clow. Mistresse, you must come away to your father</p><br>

<p id="id06711">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Were you made the messenger?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. No by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Where learned you that oath foole?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Of a certaine Knight, that swore by his Honour<br>

they were good Pan-cakes, and swore by his Honor the<br>

Mustard was naught: Now Ile stand to it, the Pancakes<br>

were naught, and the Mustard was good, and yet was<br>

not the Knight forsworne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06712">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. How proue you that in the great heape of your<br>

knowledge?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I marry, now vnmuzzle your wisedome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06713">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chinnes,<br>

and sweare by your beards that I am a knaue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06714"> Cel. By our beards (if we had them) thou art</p><br>

<p id="id06715"> Clo. By my knauerie (if I had it) then I were: but if
you sweare by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his Honor, for he neuer
had anie; or if he had, he had sworne it away, before
euer he saw those Pancakes, or that Mustard</p><br>

<p id="id06716">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Prethee, who is't that thou means't?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. One that old Fredericke your Father loues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06717"> Ros. My Fathers loue is enough to honor him enough;
speake no more of him, you'l be whipt for taxation one
of these daies</p><br>

<p id="id06718" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. The more pittie that fooles may not speak wisely,
what Wisemen do foolishly</p><br>

<p id="id06719"> Cel. By my troth thou saiest true: For, since the little
wit that fooles haue was silenced, the little foolerie that
wise men haue makes a great shew; Heere comes Monsieur
the Beu.
Enter le Beau.</p><br>

<p id="id06720"> Ros. With his mouth full of newes</p><br>

<p id="id06721" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cel. Which he will put on vs, as Pigeons feed their
young</p><br>

<p id="id06722"> Ros. Then shal we be newes-cram'd</p><br>

<p id="id06723">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. All the better: we shalbe the more Marketable.<br>

Boon-iour Monsieur le Beu, what's the newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. Faire Princesse,<br>

you haue lost much good sport<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06724">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Sport: of what colour?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. What colour Madame? How shall I aunswer<br>

you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. As wit and fortune will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06725"> Clo. Or as the destinies decrees</p><br>

<p id="id06726"> Cel. Well said, that was laid on with a trowell</p><br>

<p id="id06727"> Clo. Nay, if I keepe not my ranke</p><br>

<p id="id06728"> Ros. Thou loosest thy old smell</p><br>

<p id="id06729" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Le Beu. You amaze me Ladies: I would haue told
you of good wrastling, which you haue lost the sight of</p><br>

<p id="id06730"> Ros. Yet tell vs the manner of the Wrastling</p><br>

<p id="id06731"> Le Beu. I wil tell you the beginning: and if it please
your Ladiships, you may see the end, for the best is yet
to doe, and heere where you are, they are comming to
performe it</p><br>

<p id="id06732"> Cel. Well, the beginning that is dead and buried</p><br>

<p id="id06733"> Le Beu. There comes an old man, and his three sons</p><br>

<p id="id06734"> Cel. I could match this beginning with an old tale</p><br>

<p id="id06735">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. Three proper yong men, of excellent growth<br>

and presence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06736">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. With bils on their neckes: Be it knowne vnto<br>

all men by these presents<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06737"> Le Beu. The eldest of the three, wrastled with Charles
the Dukes Wrastler, which Charles in a moment threw
him, and broke three of his ribbes, that there is little
hope of life in him: So he seru'd the second, and so the
third: yonder they lie, the poore old man their Father,
making such pittiful dole ouer them, that all the beholders
take his part with weeping</p><br>

<p id="id06738"> Ros. Alas</p><br>

<p id="id06739">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. But what is the sport Monsieur, that the Ladies<br>

haue lost?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. Why this that I speake of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06740"> Clo. Thus men may grow wiser euery day. It is the
first time that euer I heard breaking of ribbes was sport
for Ladies</p><br>

<p id="id06741"> Cel. Or I, I promise thee</p><br>

<p id="id06742"> Ros. But is there any else longs to see this broken
Musicke in his sides? Is there yet another doates vpon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrastling Cosin?
 Le Beu. You must if you stay heere, for heere is the
place appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready to
performe it</p><br>

<p id="id06743" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cel. Yonder sure they are comming. Let vs now stay
and see it.</p><br>

<p id="id06744">Flourish. Enter Duke, Lords, Orlando, Charles, and Attendants.</p><br>

<p id="id06745">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Come on, since the youth will not be intreated<br>

His owne perill on his forwardnesse<br>

<p id="id06746">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Is yonder the man?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. Euen he, Madam<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. How now daughter, and Cousin:<br>

Are you crept hither to see the wrastling?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I my Liege, so please you giue vs leaue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06748"> Du. You wil take little delight in it, I can tell you
there is such oddes in the man: In pitie of the challengers
youth, I would faine disswade him, but he will not
bee entreated. Speake to him Ladies, see if you can
mooue him</p><br>

<p id="id06749"> Cel. Call him hether good Monsieuer Le Beu</p><br>

<p id="id06750"> Duke. Do so: Ile not be by</p><br>

<p id="id06753">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Young man, haue you challeng'd Charles the<br>

Wrastler?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. No faire Princesse: he is the generall challenger,<br>

I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength<br>

of my youth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06754"> Cel. Yong Gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
your yeares: you haue seene cruell proofe of this mans
strength, if you saw your selfe with your eies, or knew
your selfe with your iudgment, the feare of your aduenture
would counsel you to a more equall enterprise. We
pray you for your owne sake to embrace your own safetie,
and giue ouer this attempt</p><br>

<p id="id06755"> Ros. Do yong Sir, your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised: we wil make it our suite to the Duke, that
the wrastling might not go forward</p><br>

<p id="id06756"> Orl. I beseech you, punish mee not with your harde
thoughts, wherein I confesse me much guiltie to denie
so faire and excellent Ladies anie thing. But let your
faire eies, and gentle wishes go with mee to my triall;
wherein if I bee foil'd, there is but one sham'd that was
neuer gracious: if kil'd, but one dead that is willing to
be so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I haue none to
lament me: the world no iniurie, for in it I haue nothing:
onely in the world I fil vp a place, which may bee better
supplied, when I haue made it emptie</p><br>

<p id="id06757" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ros. The little strength that I haue, I would it were

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Orlando my Liege, the yongest sonne of Sir Roland<br>

de Boys<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06775">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I would thou hadst beene son to some man else,<br>

The world esteem'd thy father honourable,<br>

But I did finde him still mine enemie:<br>

Thou should'st haue better pleas'd me with this deede,<br>

Hadst thou descended from another house:<br>

But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth,<br>

I would thou had'st told me of another Father.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06776">Exit Duke.</p><br>

<p id="id06777">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Were I my Father (Coze) would I do this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I am more proud to be Sir Rolands sonne,<br>

His yongest sonne, and would not change that calling<br>

To be adopted heire to Fredricke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06778">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. My Father lou'd Sir Roland as his soule,<br>

And all the world was of my Fathers minde,<br>

Had I before knowne this yong man his sonne,<br>

I should haue giuen him teares vnto entreaties,<br>

Ere he should thus haue ventur'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06779">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Gentle Cosen,<br>

Let vs goe thanke him, and encourage him:<br>

My Fathers rough and enuious disposition<br>

Sticks me at heart: Sir, you haue well deseru'd,<br>

If you doe keepe your promises in loue;<br>

But iustly as you haue exceeded all promise,<br>

Your Mistris shall be happie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06780">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Gentleman,<br>

Weare this for me: one out of suites with fortune<br>

That could giue more, but that her hand lacks meanes.<br>

Shall we goe Coze?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. I: fare you well faire Gentleman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Can I not say, I thanke you? My better parts<br>

Are all throwne downe, and that which here stands vp<br>

Is but a quintine, a meere liuelesse blocke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. He cals vs back: my pride fell with my fortunes,<br>

Ile aske him what he would: Did you call Sir?<br>

Sir, you haue wrastled well, and ouerthrowne<br>

More then your enemies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06783">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Will you goe Coze?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Haue with you: fare you well.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06784">&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. What passion hangs these waights vpo[n] my toong?<br>

I cannot speake to her, yet she vrg'd conference.<br>

Enter Le Beu.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06785">O poore Orlando! thou art ouerthrowne<br>

Or Charles, or something weaker masters thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06786">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. Good Sir, I do in friendship counsaile you<br>

To leaue this place; Albeit you haue deseru'd<br>

High commendation, true applause, and loue;<br>

Yet such is now the Dukes condition,<br>

That he misconsters all that you haue done:<br>

The Duke is humorous, what he is indeede<br>

More suites you to conceiue, then I to speake of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06787">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I thanke you Sir; and pray you tell me this,<br>

Which of the two was daughter of the Duke,<br>

That here was at the Wrastling?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Beu. Neither his daughter, if we iudge by manners,<br>

But yet indeede the taller is his daughter,<br>

The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,<br>

And here detain'd by her vsurping Vncle<br>

To keepe his daughter companie, whose loues<br>

Are deerer then the naturall bond of Sisters:<br>

But I can tell you, that of late this Duke<br>

Hath tane displeasure 'gainst his gentle Neece,<br>

Grounded vpon no other argument,<br>

But that the people praise her for her vertues,<br>

And pittie her, for her good Fathers sake;<br>

And on my life his malice 'gainst the Lady<br>

Will sodainly breake forth: Sir, fare you well,<br>

Hereafter in a better world then this,<br>

I shall desire more loue and knowledge of you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06788">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.<br>

Thus must I from the smoake into the smother,<br>

From tyrant Duke, vnto a tyrant Brother.<br>

But heauenly Rosaline.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06789">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id06790" style="margin-top: 2em">Scena Tertius.</p><br>

<p id="id06791">Enter Celia and Rosaline.</p><br>

Not a word?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Not one to throw at a dog<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06793"> Cel. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away
vpon curs, throw some of them at me; come lame mee
with reasons</p><br>

<p id="id06794"> Ros. Then there were two Cosens laid vp, when the
one should be lam'd with reasons, and the other mad
without any</p><br>

<p id="id06795">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. But is all this for your Father?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. No, some of it is for my childes Father: Oh<br>

how full of briers is this working day world<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06796"> Cel. They are but burs, Cosen, throwne vpon thee
in holiday foolerie, if we walke not in the trodden paths
our very petty-coates will catch them</p><br>

<p id="id06797" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ros. I could shake them off my coate, these burs are

<p id="id06800"> Cel. Come, come, wrastle with thy affections</p><br>

<p id="id06801" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ros. O they take the part of a better wrastler then
my selfe</p><br>

<p id="id06802"> Cel. O, a good wish vpon you: you will trie in time
in dispight of a fall: but turning these iests out of seruice,
let vs talke in good earnest: Is it possible on such a sodaine,
you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir
Roulands yongest sonne?
 Ros. The Duke my Father lou'd his Father deerelie</p><br>

<p id="id06803"> Cel. Doth it therefore ensue that you should loue his
Sonne deerelie? By this kinde of chase, I should hate
him, for my father hated his father deerely; yet I hate
not Orlando</p><br>

<p id="id06804"> Ros. No faith, hate him not for my sake</p><br>

<p id="id06805">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Why should I not? doth he not deserue well?<br>

Enter Duke with Lords.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06806">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Let me loue him for that, and do you loue him<br>

Because I doe. Looke, here comes the Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06807"> Cel. With his eies full of anger</p><br>

<p id="id06808">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Mistris, dispatch you with your safest haste,<br>

And get you from our Court<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06809"> Ros. Me Vncle</p><br>

<p id="id06810">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. You Cosen,<br>

Within these ten daies if that thou beest found<br>

So neere our publike Court as twentie miles,<br>

Thou diest for it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06811">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I doe beseech your Grace<br>

Let me the knowledge of my fault beare with me:<br>

If with my selfe I hold intelligence,<br>

Or haue acquaintance with mine owne desires,<br>

If that I doe not dreame, or be not franticke,<br>

(As I doe trust I am not) then deere Vncle,<br>

Neuer so much as in a thought vnborne,<br>

Did I offend your highnesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Thus doe all Traitors,<br>

If their purgation did consist in words,<br>

They are as innocent as grace it selfe;<br>

Let is suffice thee that I trust thee not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a Traitor;<br>

Tell me whereon the likelihoods depends?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. Thou art thy Fathers daughter, there's enough<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06814">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. So was I when your highnes took his Dukdome,<br>

So was I when your highnesse banisht him;<br>

Treason is not inherited my Lord,<br>

Or if we did deriue it from our friends,<br>

What's that to me, my Father was no Traitor,<br>

Then good my Leige, mistake me not so much,<br>

To thinke my pouertie is treacherous<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06815"> Cel. Deere Soueraigne heare me speake</p><br>

<p id="id06816">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. I Celia, we staid her for your sake,<br>

Else had she with her Father rang'd along<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. I did not then intreat to haue her stay,<br>

It was your pleasure, and your owne remorse,<br>

I was too yong that time to value her,<br>

But now I know her: if she be a Traitor,<br>

Why so am I: we still haue slept together,<br>

Rose at an instant, learn'd, plaid, eate together,<br>

And wheresoere we went, like Iunos Swans,<br>

Still we went coupled and inseperable<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. She is too subtile for thee, and her smoothnes;<br>

Her verie silence, and her patience,<br>

Speake to the people, and they pittie her:<br>

Thou art a foole, she robs thee of thy name,<br>

And thou wilt show more bright, &amp; seem more vertuous<br>

When she is gone: then open not thy lips<br>

Firme, and irreuocable is my doombe,<br>

Which I haue past vpon her, she is banish'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06819">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Pronounce that sentence then on me my Leige,<br>

I cannot liue out of her companie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06820">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duk. You are a foole: you Neice prouide your selfe,<br>

If you out-stay the time, vpon mine honor,<br>

And in the greatnesse of my word you die.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06821">Exit Duke, &amp;c.</p><br>

<p id="id06822">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. O my poore Rosaline, whether wilt thou goe?<br>

Wilt thou change Fathers? I will giue thee mine:<br>

I charge thee be not thou more grieu'd then I am<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06823"> Ros. I haue more cause</p><br>

<p id="id06824">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Thou hast not Cosen,<br>

Prethee be cheerefull; know'st thou not the Duke<br>

Hath banish'd me his daughter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. That he hath not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06825">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. No, hath not? Rosaline lacks then the loue<br>

Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one,<br>

Shall we be sundred? shall we part sweete girle?<br>

No, let my Father seeke another heire:<br>

Therefore deuise with me how we may flie<br>

Whether to goe, and what to beare with vs,<br>

And doe not seeke to take your change vpon you,<br>

To beare your griefes your selfe, and leaue me out:<br>

For by this heauen, now at our sorrowes pale;<br>

Say what thou canst, Ile goe along with thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06826">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Why, whether shall we goe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. To seeke my Vncle in the Forrest of Arden<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06827">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Alas, what danger will it be to vs,<br>

(Maides as we are) to trauell forth so farre?<br>

Beautie prouoketh theeues sooner then gold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06828">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Ile put my selfe in poore and meane attire,<br>

And with a kinde of vmber smirch my face,<br>

The like doe you, so shall we passe along,<br>

And neuer stir assailants<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06829">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Were it not better,<br>

Because that I am more then common tall,<br>

That I did suite me all points like a man,<br>

A gallant curtelax vpon my thigh,<br>

A bore-speare in my hand, and in my heart<br>

Lye there what hidden womans feare there will,<br>

Weele haue a swashing and a marshall outside,<br>

As manie other mannish cowards haue,<br>

That doe outface it with their semblances<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06830">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Ile haue no worse a name then Ioues owne Page,<br>

And therefore looke you call me Ganimed.<br>

But what will you be call'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Something that hath a reference to my state:<br>

No longer Celia, but Aliena<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06831">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But Cosen, what if we assaid to steale<br>

The clownish Foole out of your Fathers Court:<br>

Would he not be a comfort to our trauaile?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Heele goe along ore the wide world with me,<br>

Leaue me alone to woe him; Let's away<br>

And get our Iewels and our wealth together,<br>

Deuise the fittest time, and safest way<br>

To hide vs from pursuite that will be made<br>

After my flight: now goe in we content<br>

To libertie, and not to banishment.<br>

And in that kinde sweares you doe more vsurpe<br>

To day my Lord of Amiens, and my selfe,<br>

Did steale behinde him as he lay along<br>

Vnder an oake, whose anticke roote peepes out<br>

Vpon the brooke that brawles along this wood,<br>

To the which place a poore sequestred Stag<br>

That from the Hunters aime had tane a hurt,<br>

That their discharge did stretch his leatherne coat<br>

Almost to bursting, and the big round teares<br>

Cours'd one another downe his innocent nose<br>

In pitteous chase: and thus the hairie foole,<br>

Much marked of the melancholie Iaques,<br>

Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brooke,<br>

Augmenting it with teares<br>

<p id="id06839">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. But what said Iaques?<br>

Poore Deere quoth he, thou mak'st a testament<br>

As worldlings doe, giuing thy sum of more<br>

To that which had too much: then being there alone,<br>

Left and abandoned of his veluet friend;<br>

'Tis right quoth he, thus miserie doth part<br>

The Fluxe of companie: anon a carelesse Heard<br>

Full of the pasture, iumps along by him<br>

And neuer staies to greet him: I quoth Iaques,<br>

'Tis iust the fashion; wherefore doe you looke<br>

Vpon that poore and broken bankrupt there?<br>

Thus most inuectiuely he pierceth through<br>

Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we<br>

Are meere vsurpers, tyrants, and whats worse<br>

To fright the Annimals, and to kill them vp<br>

Oh my sweet master, O you memorie<br>

Of old Sir Rowland; why, what make you here?<br>

Why are you vertuous? Why do people loue you?<br>

And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?<br>

Why would you be so fond to ouercome<br>

The bonnie priser of the humorous Duke?<br>

Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.<br>

Know you not Master, to seeme kinde of men,<br>

Are sanctified and holy traitors to you:<br>

Oh what a world is this, when what is comely<br>

Enuenoms him that beares it?<br>

Why, what's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad. O vnhappie youth,<br>

Come not within these doores: within this roofe<br>

Your brother, no, no brother, yet the sonne<br>

(Yet not the son, I will not call him son)<br>

And vnregarded age in corners throwne,<br>

Be comfort to my age: here is the gold,<br>

All this I giue you, let me be your seruant,<br>

Hot, and rebellious liquors in my bloud,<br>

When seruice sweate for dutie, not for meede:<br>

Thou art not for the fashion of these times,<br>

Where none will sweate, but for promotion,<br>

And hauing that do choake their seruice vp,<br>

Euen with the hauing, it is not so with thee:<br>

But poore old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree,<br>

That cannot so much as a blossome yeelde,<br>

In lieu of all thy paines and husbandrie,<br>

<p id="id06899">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. It will make you melancholly Monsieur Iaques<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. I thanke it: More, I prethee more,<br>

I can sucke melancholly out of a song,<br>

As a Weazel suckes egges: More, I pre'thee more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06900">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. My voice is ragged, I know I cannot please<br>

you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06901">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. I do not desire you to please me,<br>

I do desire you to sing:<br>

Come, more, another stanzo: Cal you 'em stanzo's?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. What you wil Monsieur Iaques<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06902">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Nay, I care not for their names, they owe mee<br>

nothing. Wil you sing?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. More at your request, then to please my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06903"> Iaq. Well then, if euer I thanke any man, Ile thanke
you: but that they cal complement is like th' encounter
of two dog-Apes. And when a man thankes me hartily,
me thinkes I haue giuen him a penie, and he renders me
the beggerly thankes. Come sing; and you that wil not
hold your tongues</p><br>

<p id="id06904"> Amy. Wel, Ile end the song. Sirs, couer the while,
the Duke wil drinke vnder this tree; he hath bin all this
day to looke you</p><br>

<p id="id06905">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. And I haue bin all this day to auoid him:<br>

He is too disputeable for my companie:<br>

I thinke of as many matters as he, but I giue<br>

Heauen thankes, and make no boast of them.<br>

Come, warble, come.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06906">Song. Altogether heere.</p><br>

<p id="id06907">Who doth ambition shunne,
and loues to liue i'th Sunne:
Seeking the food he eates,
and pleas'd with what he gets:
Come hither, come hither, come hither,
Heere shall he see. &amp;c</p><br>

<p id="id06908">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Ile giue you a verse to this note,<br>

That I made yesterday in despight of my Inuention<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06909"> Amy. And Ile sing it</p><br>

<p id="id06910">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. Thus it goes.<br>

If it do come to passe, that any man turne Asse:<br>

Leauing his wealth and ease,<br>

A stubborne will to please,<br>

Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:<br>

Heere shall he see, grosse fooles as he,<br>

And if he will come to me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06911">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. What's that Ducdame?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. 'Tis a Greeke inuocation, to call fools into a circle.<br>

Ile go sleepe if I can: if I cannot, Ile raile against all<br>

the first borne of Egypt<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06912">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy. And Ile go seeke the Duke,<br>

His banket is prepar'd.<br>

O I die for food. Heere lie I downe,<br>

And measure out my graue. Farwel kinde master<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06917">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Why how now Adam? No greater heart in thee:<br>

Liue a little, comfort a little, cheere thy selfe a little.<br>

If this vncouth Forrest yeeld any thing sauage,<br>

I wil either be food for it, or bring it for foode to thee:<br>

Thy conceite is neerer death, then thy powers.<br>

For my sake be comfortable, hold death a while<br>

At the armes end: I wil heere be with thee presently,<br>

And if I bring thee not something to eate,<br>

I wil giue thee leaue to die: but if thou diest<br>

Before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor.<br>

Wel said, thou look'st cheerely,<br>

And Ile be with thee quickly: yet thou liest<br>

In the bleake aire. Come, I wil beare thee<br>

To some shelter, and thou shalt not die<br>

For lacke of a dinner,<br>

<p id="id06921">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. I thinke he be transform'd into a beast,<br>

For I can no where finde him, like a man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06922">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Lord. My Lord, he is but euen now gone hence,<br>

Heere was he merry, hearing of a Song<br>

<p id="id06923">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. If he compact of iarres, grow Musicall,<br>

We shall haue shortly discord in the Spheares:<br>

Go seeke him, tell him I would speake with him.<br>

Enter Iaques.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06924"> 1.Lord. He saues my labor by his owne approach</p><br>

<p id="id06925">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Why how now Monsieur, what a life is this<br>

That your poore friends must woe your companie,<br>

What, you looke merrily<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06926">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. A Foole, a foole: I met a foole i'th Forrest,<br>

A motley Foole (a miserable world:)<br>

As I do liue by foode, I met a foole,<br>

Who laid him downe, and bask'd him in the Sun,<br>

And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes,<br>

In good set termes, and yet a motley foole.<br>

Good morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he,<br>

Call me not foole, till heauen hath sent me fortune,<br>

And then he drew a diall from his poake,<br>

And looking on it, with lacke-lustre eye,<br>

Sayes, very wisely, it is ten a clocke:<br>

Thus we may see (quoth he) how the world wagges:<br>

'Tis but an houre agoe, since it was nine,<br>

And after one houre more, 'twill be eleuen,<br>

And so from houre to houre, we ripe, and ripe,<br>

And then from houre to houre, we rot, and rot,<br>

And thereby hangs a tale. When I did heare<br>

The motley Foole, thus morall on the time,<br>

My Lungs began to crow like Chanticleere,<br>

That Fooles should be so deepe contemplatiue:<br>

And I did laugh, sans intermission<br>

An houre by his diall. Oh noble foole,<br>

A worthy foole: Motley's the onely weare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06927">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. What foole is this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. O worthie Foole: One that hath bin a Courtier<br>

And sayes, if Ladies be but yong, and faire,<br>

They haue the gift to know it: and in his braine,<br>

Which is as drie as the remainder bisket<br>

After a voyage: He hath strange places cram'd<br>

With obseruation, the which he vents<br>

In mangled formes. O that I were a foole,<br>

I am ambitious for a motley coat<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06928"> Du.Sen. Thou shalt haue one</p><br>

<p id="id06929">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. It is my onely suite,<br>

Prouided that you weed your better iudgements<br>

Of all opinion that growes ranke in them,<br>

That I am wise. I must haue liberty<br>

Withall, as large a Charter as the winde,<br>

To blow on whom I please, for so fooles haue:<br>

And they that are most gauled with my folly,<br>

They most must laugh: And why sir must they so?<br>

The why is plaine, as way to Parish Church:<br>

Hee, that a Foole doth very wisely hit,<br>

Doth very foolishly, although he smart<br>

Seeme senselesse of the bob. If not,<br>

The Wise-mans folly is anathomiz'd<br>

Euen by the squandring glances of the foole.<br>

Inuest me in my motley: Giue me leaue<br>

To speake my minde, and I will through and through<br>

Cleanse the foule bodie of th' infected world,<br>

If they will patiently receiue my medicine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06930"> Du.Sen. Fie on thee. I can tell what thou wouldst do</p><br>

<p id="id06931">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. What, for a Counter, would I do, but good?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Most mischeeuous foule sin, in chiding sin:<br>

For thou thy selfe hast bene a Libertine,<br>

As sensuall as the brutish sting it selfe,<br>

And all th' imbossed sores, and headed euils,<br>

That thou with license of free foot hast caught,<br>

Would'st thou disgorge into the generall world<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06932">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Why who cries out on pride,<br>

That can therein taxe any priuate party:<br>

Doth it not flow as hugely as the Sea,<br>

Till that the wearie verie meanes do ebbe.<br>

What woman in the Citie do I name,<br>

When that I say the City woman beares<br>

The cost of Princes on vnworthy shoulders?<br>

Who can come in, and say that I meane her,<br>

When such a one as shee, such is her neighbor?<br>

Or what is he of basest function,<br>

That sayes his brauerie is not on my cost,<br>

Thinking that I meane him, but therein suites<br>

His folly to the mettle of my speech,<br>

There then, how then, what then, let me see wherein<br>

My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,<br>

Then he hath wrong'd himselfe: if he be free,<br>

Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies<br>

Vnclaim'd of any man. But who come here?<br>

Enter Orlando.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06933"> Orl. Forbeare, and eate no more</p><br>

<p id="id06934"> Iaq. Why I haue eate none yet</p><br>

<p id="id06935"> Orl. Nor shalt not, till necessity be seru'd</p><br>

<p id="id06936">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Of what kinde should this Cocke come of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distres?<br>

Or else a rude despiser of good manners,<br>

That in ciuility thou seem'st so emptie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. You touch'd my veine at first, the thorny point<br>

Of bare distresse, hath tane from me the shew<br>

Of smooth ciuility: yet am I in-land bred,<br>

And know some nourture: But forbeare, I say,<br>

He dies that touches any of this fruite,<br>

Till I, and my affaires are answered<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06937">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. And you will not be answer'd with reason,<br>

I must dye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06938">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. What would you haue?<br>

Your gentlenesse shall force, more then your force<br>

Moue vs to gentlenesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06939"> Orl. I almost die for food, and let me haue it</p><br>

<p id="id06940">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Sit downe and feed, &amp; welcom to our table<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Speake you so gently? Pardon me I pray you,<br>

I thought that all things had bin sauage heere,<br>

And therefore put I on the countenance<br>

Of sterne command'ment. But what ere you are<br>

That in this desert inaccessible,<br>

Vnder the shade of melancholly boughes,<br>

Loose, and neglect the creeping houres of time:<br>

If euer you haue look'd on better dayes:<br>

If euer beene where bels haue knoll'd to Church:<br>

If euer sate at any good mans feast:<br>

If euer from your eye-lids wip'd a teare,<br>

And know what 'tis to pittie, and be pittied:<br>

Let gentlenesse my strong enforcement be,<br>

In the which hope, I blush, and hide my Sword<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06941">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. True is it, that we haue seene better dayes,<br>

And haue with holy bell bin knowld to Church,<br>

And sat at good mens feasts, and wip'd our eies<br>

Of drops, that sacred pity hath engendred:<br>

And therefore sit you downe in gentlenesse,<br>

And take vpon command, what helpe we haue<br>

That to your wanting may be ministred<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06942">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Then but forbeare your food a little while:<br>

Whiles (like a Doe) I go to finde my Fawne,<br>

And giue it food. There is an old poore man,<br>

Who after me, hath many a weary steppe<br>

Limpt in pure loue: till he be first suffic'd,<br>

Opprest with two weake euils, age, and hunger,<br>

I will not touch a bit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06943">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Sen. Go finde him out,<br>

And we will nothing waste till you returne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06944"> Orl. I thanke ye, and be blest for your good comfort</p><br>

<p id="id06945">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Thou seest, we are not all alone vnhappie:<br>

This wide and vniuersall Theater<br>

Presents more wofull Pageants then the Sceane<br>

Wherein we play in<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06946">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ia. All the world's a stage,<br>

And all the men and women, meerely Players;<br>

They haue their Exits and their Entrances,<br>

And one man in his time playes many parts,<br>

His Acts being seuen ages. At first the Infant,<br>

Mewling, and puking in the Nurses armes:<br>

Then, the whining Schoole-boy with his Satchell<br>

And shining morning face, creeping like snaile<br>

Vnwillingly to schoole. And then the Louer,<br>

Sighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad<br>

Made to his Mistresse eye-brow. Then, a Soldier,<br>

Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the Pard,<br>

Ielous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in quarrell,<br>

Seeking the bubble Reputation<br>

Euen in the Canons mouth: And then, the Iustice<br>

In faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd,<br>

With eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut,<br>

Full of wise sawes, and moderne instances,<br>

And so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts<br>

Into the leane and slipper'd Pantaloone,<br>

With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,<br>

His youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide,<br>

For his shrunke shanke, and his bigge manly voice,<br>

Turning againe toward childish trebble pipes,<br>

And whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all,<br>

That ends this strange euentfull historie,<br>

Is second childishnesse, and meere obliuion,<br>

Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing.<br>

Enter Orlando with Adam.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06947">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Welcome: set downe your venerable burthen,<br>

and let him feede<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06948"> Orl. I thanke you most for him</p><br>

<p id="id06949">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad. So had you neede,<br>

I scarce can speake to thanke you for my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06950">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Sen. Welcome, fall too: I wil not trouble you,<br>

As yet to question you about your fortunes:<br>

Giue vs some Musicke, and good Cozen, sing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06951">Song.</p><br>

Heigh ho, sing heigh ho, vnto the greene holly,<br>

Most frendship, is fayning; most Louing, meere folly:<br>

This Life is most iolly.<br>

Freize, freize, thou bitter skie that dost not bight so nigh<br>

as benefitts forgot:<br>

Though thou the waters warpe, thy sting is not so sharpe,<br>

as freind remembred not.<br>

Heigh ho, sing, &amp;c<br>

<p id="id06953">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Sen. If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son,<br>

As you haue whisper'd faithfully you were,<br>

And as mine eye doth his effigies witnesse,<br>

Most truly limn'd, and liuing in your face,<br>

Be truly welcome hither: I am the Duke<br>

That lou'd your Father, the residue of your fortune,<br>

Go to my Caue, and tell mee. Good old man,<br>

Thou art right welcome, as thy masters is:<br>

Finde out thy brother wheresoere he is,<br>

Seeke him with Candle: bring him dead, or liuing<br>

<p id="id06964">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id06965">Enter Corin &amp; Clowne.</p><br>

<p id="id06966"> Co. And how like you this shepherds life Mr Touchstone?
 Clow. Truely Shepheard, in respect of it selfe, it is a
good life; but in respect that it is a shepheards life, it is
naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it verie well:
but in respect that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now
in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth mee well: but in
respect it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a spare
life (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no
more plentie in it, it goes much against my stomacke.
Has't any Philosophie in thee shepheard?
 Cor. No more, but that I know the more one sickens,
the worse at ease he is: and that hee that wants money,
meanes, and content, is without three good frends. That
the propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That
good pasture makes fat sheepe: and that a great cause of
the night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath learned
no wit by Nature, nor Art, may complaine of good
breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred</p><br>

<p id="id06967">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Such a one is a naturall Philosopher:<br>

Was't euer in Court, Shepheard?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cor. No truly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06968"> Clo. Then thou art damn'd</p><br>

<p id="id06969"> Cor. Nay, I hope</p><br>

<p id="id06970" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Truly thou art damn'd, like an ill roasted Egge,
all on one side</p><br>

<p id="id06971"> Cor. For not being at Court? your reason</p><br>

<p id="id06972"> Clo. Why, if thou neuer was't at Court, thou neuer
saw'st good manners: if thou neuer saw'st good maners,
then thy manners must be wicked, and wickednes is sin,
and sinne is damnation: Thou art in a parlous state shepheard</p><br>

<p id="id06973"> Cor. Not a whit Touchstone, those that are good maners
at the Court, are as ridiculous in the Countrey, as
the behauiour of the Countrie is most mockeable at the
Court. You told me, you salute not at the Court, but
you kisse your hands; that courtesie would be vncleanlie
if Courtiers were shepheards</p><br>

<p id="id06974"> Clo. Instance, briefly: come, instance</p><br>

<p id="id06975">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cor. Why we are still handling our Ewes, and their<br>

Fels you know are greasie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06976"> Clo. Why do not your Courtiers hands sweate? and
is not the grease of a Mutton, as wholesome as the sweat
of a man? Shallow, shallow: A better instance I say:
Come</p><br>

<p id="id06977"> Cor. Besides, our hands are hard</p><br>

<p id="id06978" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Your lips wil feele them the sooner. Shallow agen:
a more sounder instance, come</p><br>

<p id="id06979"> Cor. And they are often tarr'd ouer, with the surgery
of our sheepe: and would you haue vs kisse Tarre? The
Courtiers hands are perfum'd with Ciuet</p><br>

<p id="id06980"> Clo. Most shallow man: Thou wormes meate in respect
of a good peece of flesh indeed: learne of the wise
and perpend: Ciuet is of a baser birth then Tarre, the
verie vncleanly fluxe of a Cat. Mend the instance Shepheard</p><br>

<p id="id06981"> Cor. You haue too Courtly a wit, for me, Ile rest</p><br>

<p id="id06982" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God helpe thee shallow
man: God make incision in thee, thou art raw</p><br>

<p id="id06983"> Cor. Sir, I am a true Labourer, I earne that I eate: get
that I weare; owe no man hate, enuie no mans happinesse:
glad of other mens good content with my harme:
and the greatest of my pride, is to see my Ewes graze, &amp;
my Lambes sucke</p><br>

<p id="id06984"> Clo. That is another simple sinne in you, to bring the
Ewes and the Rammes together, and to offer to get your
liuing, by the copulation of Cattle, to be bawd to a Belweather,
and to betray a shee-Lambe of a tweluemonth
to a crooked-pated olde Cuckoldly Ramme, out of all
reasonable match. If thou bee'st not damn'd for this, the
diuell himselfe will haue no shepherds, I cannot see else
how thou shouldst scape</p><br>

<p id="id06985">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cor. Heere comes yong Mr Ganimed, my new Mistrisses<br>

Brother.<br>

Enter Rosalind<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06986"> Ros. From the east to westerne Inde,
no iewel is like Rosalinde,
Hir worth being mounted on the winde,
through all the world beares Rosalinde.
All the pictures fairest Linde,
are but blacke to Rosalinde:
Let no face bee kept in mind,
but the faire of Rosalinde</p><br>

<p id="id06987"> Clo. Ile rime you so, eight yeares together; dinners,
and suppers, and sleeping hours excepted: it is the right
Butter-womens ranke to Market</p><br>

<p id="id06988"> Ros. Out Foole</p><br>

<p id="id06989"> Clo. For a taste.
If a Hart doe lacke a Hinde,
Let him seeke out Rosalinde:
If the Cat will after kinde,
so be sure will Rosalinde:
Wintred garments must be linde,
so must slender Rosalinde:
They that reap must sheafe and binde,
then to cart with Rosalinde.
Sweetest nut, hath sowrest rinde,
such a nut is Rosalinde.
He that sweetest rose will finde,
must finde Loues pricke, &amp; Rosalinde.
This is the verie false gallop of Verses, why doe you infect
your selfe with them?
 Ros. Peace you dull foole, I found them on a tree</p><br>

<p id="id06990"> Clo. Truely the tree yeelds bad fruite</p><br>

<p id="id06991"> Ros. Ile graffe it with you, and then I shall graffe it
with a Medler: then it will be the earliest fruit i'th country:
for you'l be rotten ere you bee halfe ripe, and that's
the right vertue of the Medler</p><br>

<p id="id06992">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. You haue said: but whether wisely or no, let the<br>

Forrest iudge.<br>

Enter Celia with a writing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06993"> Ros. Peace, here comes my sister reading, stand aside</p><br>

<p id="id06994"> Cel. Why should this Desert bee,
for it is vnpeopled? Noe:
Tonges Ile hang on euerie tree,
that shall ciuill sayings shoe.
Some, how briefe the Life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage,
That the stretching of a span,
buckles in his summe of age.
Some of violated vowes,
twixt the soules of friend, and friend:
But vpon the fairest bowes,
or at euerie sentence end;
Will I Rosalinda write,
teaching all that reade, to know
The quintessence of euerie sprite,
heauen would in little show.
Therefore heauen Nature charg'd,
that one bodie should be fill'd
With all Graces wide enlarg'd,
nature presently distill'd
Helens cheeke, but not his heart,
Cleopatra's Maiestie:
Attalanta's better part,
sad Lucrecia's Modestie.
Thus Rosalinde of manie parts,
by Heauenly Synode was deuis'd,
Of manie faces, eyes, and hearts,
to haue the touches deerest pris'd.
Heauen would that shee these gifts should haue,
and I to liue and die her slaue</p><br>

<p id="id06995"> Ros. O most gentle Iupiter, what tedious homilie of
Loue haue you wearied your parishioners withall, and
neuer cri'de, haue patience good people</p><br>

<p id="id06996" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cel. How now backe friends: Shepheard, go off a little:
go with him sirrah</p><br>

<p id="id06997"> Clo. Come Shepheard, let vs make an honorable retreit,
though not with bagge and baggage, yet with
scrip and scrippage.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id06998">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Didst thou heare these verses?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some<br>

of them had in them more feete then the Verses would<br>

beare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id06999"> Cel. That's no matter: the feet might beare y verses</p><br>

<p id="id07000"> Ros. I, but the feet were lame, and could not beare
themselues without the verse, and therefore stood lamely
in the verse</p><br>

<p id="id07001"> Cel. But didst thou heare without wondering, how
thy name should be hang'd and carued vpon these trees?
 Ros. I was seuen of the nine daies out of the wonder,
before you came: for looke heere what I found on a
Palme tree; I was neuer so berim'd since Pythagoras time
that I was an Irish Rat, which I can hardly remember</p><br>

<p id="id07002">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Tro you, who hath done this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Is it a man?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. And a chaine that you once wore about his neck:<br>

change you colour?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I pre'thee who?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to<br>

meete; but Mountaines may bee remoou'd with Earthquakes,<br>

and so encounter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07003">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Nay, but who is it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Is it possible?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Nay, I pre'thee now, with most petitionary vehemence,<br>

tell me who it is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07004"> Cel. O wonderfull, wonderfull, and most wonderfull
wonderfull, and yet againe wonderful, and after that out
of all hooping</p><br>

<p id="id07005"> Ros. Good my complection, dost thou think though
I am caparison'd like a man, I haue a doublet and hose in
my disposition? One inch of delay more, is a South-sea
of discouerie. I pre'thee tell me, who is it quickely, and
speake apace: I would thou couldst stammer, that thou
might'st powre this conceal'd man out of thy mouth, as
Wine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle: either too
much at once, or none at all. I pre'thee take the Corke
out of thy mouth, that I may drinke thy tydings</p><br>

<p id="id07006"> Cel. So you may put a man in your belly</p><br>

<p id="id07007">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Is he of Gods making? What manner of man?<br>

Is his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Nay, he hath but a little beard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07008"> Ros. Why God will send more, if the man will bee
thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou
delay me not the knowledge of his chin</p><br>

<p id="id07009">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. It is yong Orlando, that tript vp the Wrastlers<br>

heeles, and your heart, both in an instant<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07010">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Nay, but the diuell take mocking: speake sadde<br>

brow, and true maid<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07011"> Cel. I'faith (Coz) tis he</p><br>

<p id="id07012">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Orlando?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Orlando<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07013"> Ros. Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet &amp;
hose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What sayde
he? How look'd he? Wherein went he? What makes hee
heere? Did he aske for me? Where remaines he? How
parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him againe?
Answer me in one word</p><br>

<p id="id07014"> Cel. You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first:
'tis a Word too great for any mouth of this Ages size, to
say I and no, to these particulars, is more then to answer
in a Catechisme</p><br>

<p id="id07015"> Ros. But doth he know that I am in this Forrest, and
in mans apparrell? Looks he as freshly, as he did the day
he Wrastled?
 Cel. It is as easie to count Atomies as to resolue the
propositions of a Louer: but take a taste of my finding
him, and rellish it with good obseruance. I found him
vnder a tree like a drop'd Acorne</p><br>

<p id="id07016" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ros. It may wel be cal'd Ioues tree, when it droppes
forth fruite</p><br>

<p id="id07017"> Cel. Giue me audience, good Madam</p><br>

<p id="id07018"> Ros. Proceed</p><br>

<p id="id07019">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. There lay hee stretch'd along like a Wounded<br>

knight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07020">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Though it be pittie to see such a sight, it well<br>

becomes the ground<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07021">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Cry holla, to the tongue, I prethee: it curuettes<br>

vnseasonably. He was furnish'd like a Hunter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07022"> Ros. O ominous, he comes to kill my Hart</p><br>

<p id="id07023">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. I would sing my song without a burthen, thou<br>

bring'st me out of tune<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07024">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Do you not know I am a woman, when I thinke,<br>

I must speake: sweet, say on.<br>

Enter Orlando &amp; Iaques.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07025">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. You bring me out. Soft, comes he not heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. 'Tis he, slinke by, and note him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07026">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. I thanke you for your company, but good faith<br>

I had as liefe haue beene my selfe alone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07027">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. And so had I: but yet for fashion sake<br>

I thanke you too, for your societie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07028"> Iaq. God buy you, let's meet as little as we can</p><br>

<p id="id07029"> Orl. I do desire we may be better strangers</p><br>

<p id="id07030">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. I pray you marre no more trees with Writing<br>

Loue-songs in their barkes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07031">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I pray you marre no moe of my verses with reading<br>

them ill-fauouredly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07032">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Rosalinde is your loues name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Yes, Iust<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07033"> Iaq. I do not like her name</p><br>

<p id="id07034">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. There was no thought of pleasing you when she<br>

was christen'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07035">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. What stature is she of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Iust as high as my heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07036">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. You are ful of prety answers: haue you not bin acquainted<br>

with goldsmiths wiues, &amp; cond the[m] out of rings<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Not so: but I answer you right painted cloath,<br>

from whence you haue studied your questions<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07037"> Iaq. You haue a nimble wit; I thinke 'twas made of
Attalanta's heeles. Will you sitte downe with me, and
wee two, will raile against our Mistris the world, and all
our miserie</p><br>

<p id="id07038" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Orl. I wil chide no breather in the world but my selfe
against whom I know most faults</p><br>

<p id="id07039"> Iaq. The worst fault you haue, is to be in loue</p><br>

<p id="id07040">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. 'Tis a fault I will not change, for your best vertue:<br>

I am wearie of you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07041">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. By my troth, I was seeking for a Foole, when I<br>

found you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07042">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. He is drown'd in the brooke, looke but in, and<br>

you shall see him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07043"> Iaq. There I shal see mine owne figure</p><br>

<p id="id07044"> Orl. Which I take to be either a foole, or a Cipher</p><br>

<p id="id07045">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Ile tarrie no longer with you, farewell good signior<br>

Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07046">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I am glad of your departure: Adieu good Monsieur<br>

Melancholly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07047">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I wil speake to him like a sawcie Lacky, and vnder<br>

that habit play the knaue with him, do you hear Forrester<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07048">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Verie wel, what would you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I pray you, what i'st a clocke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. You should aske me what time o' day: there's no<br>

clocke in the Forrest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07049"> Ros. Then there is no true Louer in the Forrest, else
sighing euerie minute, and groaning euerie houre wold
detect the lazie foot of time, as wel as a clocke</p><br>

<p id="id07050"> Orl. And why not the swift foote of time? Had not
that bin as proper?
 Ros. By no meanes sir; Time trauels in diuers paces,
with diuers persons: Ile tel you who Time ambles withall,
who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal,
and who he stands stil withall</p><br>

<p id="id07051"> Orl. I prethee, who doth he trot withal?
 Ros. Marry he trots hard with a yong maid, between
the contract of her marriage, and the day it is solemnizd:
if the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard,
that it seemes the length of seuen yeare</p><br>

<p id="id07052"> Orl. Who ambles Time withal?
 Ros. With a Priest that lacks Latine, and a rich man
that hath not the Gowt: for the one sleepes easily because
he cannot study, and the other liues merrily, because
he feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of
leane and wasteful Learning; the other knowing no burthen
of heauie tedious penurie. These Time ambles
withal</p><br>

<p id="id07053">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Who doth he gallop withal?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. With a theefe to the gallowes: for though hee<br>

go as softly as foot can fall, he thinkes himselfe too soon<br>

there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07054">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Who staies it stil withal?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. With Lawiers in the vacation: for they sleepe<br>

betweene Terme and Terme, and then they perceiue not<br>

how time moues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07055">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Where dwel you prettie youth?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. With this Shepheardesse my sister: heere in the<br>

skirts of the Forrest, like fringe vpon a petticoat<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07056">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Are you natiue of this place?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. As the Conie that you see dwell where shee is<br>

kindled<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07057">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Your accent is something finer, then you could<br>

purchase in so remoued a dwelling<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07058"> Ros. I haue bin told so of many: but indeed, an olde
religious Vnckle of mine taught me to speake, who was
in his youth an inland man, one that knew Courtship too
well: for there he fel in loue. I haue heard him read many
Lectors against it, and I thanke God, I am not a Woman
to be touch'd with so many giddie offences as hee
hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal</p><br>

<p id="id07059"> Orl. Can you remember any of the principall euils,
that he laid to the charge of women?
 Ros. There were none principal, they were all like
one another, as halfepence are, euerie one fault seeming
monstrous, til his fellow-fault came to match it</p><br>

<p id="id07060"> Orl. I prethee recount some of them</p><br>

<p id="id07061"> Ros. No: I wil not cast away my physick, but on those
that are sicke. There is a man haunts the Forrest, that abuses
our yong plants with caruing Rosalinde on their
barkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on
brambles; all (forsooth) defying the name of Rosalinde.
If I could meet that Fancie-monger, I would giue him
some good counsel, for he seemes to haue the Quotidian
of Loue vpon him</p><br>

<p id="id07062" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Orl. I am he that is so Loue-shak'd, I pray you tel
me your remedie</p><br>

<p id="id07063"> Ros. There is none of my Vnckles markes vpon you:
he taught me how to know a man in loue: in which cage
of rushes, I am sure you art not prisoner</p><br>

<p id="id07064"> Orl. What were his markes?
 Ros. A leane cheeke, which you haue not: a blew eie
and sunken, which you haue not: an vnquestionable spirit,
which you haue not: a beard neglected, which you
haue not: (but I pardon you for that, for simply your hauing
in beard, is a yonger brothers reuennew) then your
hose should be vngarter'd, your bonnet vnbanded, your
sleeue vnbutton'd, your shoo vnti'de, and euerie thing
about you, demonstrating a carelesse desolation: but you
are no such man; you are rather point deuice in your
accoustrements,
as louing your selfe, then seeming the Louer
of any other</p><br>

<p id="id07065"> Orl. Faire youth, I would I could make thee beleeue I Loue</p><br>

<p id="id07066"> Ros. Me beleeue it? You may assoone make her that
you Loue beleeue it, which I warrant she is apter to do,
then to confesse she do's: that is one of the points, in the
which women stil giue the lie to their consciences. But
in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the
Trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?
 Orl. I sweare to thee youth, by the white hand of
Rosalind, I am that he, that vnfortunate he</p><br>

<p id="id07067">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But are you so much in loue, as your rimes speak?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Neither rime nor reason can expresse how much<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07068"> Ros. Loue is meerely a madnesse, and I tel you, deserues
as wel a darke house, and a whip, as madmen do:
and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured, is
that the Lunacie is so ordinarie, that the whippers are in
loue too: yet I professe curing it by counsel</p><br>

<p id="id07069"> Orl. Did you euer cure any so?
 Ros. Yes one, and in this manner. Hee was to imagine
me his Loue, his Mistris: and I set him euerie day
to woe me. At which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, greeue, be effeminate, changeable, longing, and
liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, ful
of teares, full of smiles; for euerie passion something, and
for no passion truly any thing, as boyes and women are
for the most part, cattle of this colour: would now like
him, now loath him: then entertaine him, then forswear
him: now weepe for him, then spit at him; that I draue
my Sutor from his mad humor of loue, to a liuing humor
of madnes, w was to forsweare the ful stream of y world,
and to liue in a nooke meerly Monastick: and thus I cur'd
him, and this way wil I take vpon mee to wash your Liuer
as cleane as a sound sheepes heart, that there shal not
be one spot of Loue in't</p><br>

<p id="id07070"> Orl. I would not be cured, youth</p><br>

<p id="id07071">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind,<br>

and come euerie day to my Coat, and woe me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07072">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orlan. Now by the faith of my loue, I will; Tel me<br>

where it is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07073">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Go with me to it, and Ile shew it you: and by<br>

the way, you shal tell me, where in the Forrest you liue:<br>

Wil you go?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. With all my heart, good youth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07074">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Nay, you must call mee Rosalind: Come sister,<br>

will you go?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07075">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id07077">Enter Clowne, Audrey, &amp; Iaques.</p><br>

<p id="id07078">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Come apace good Audrey, I wil fetch vp your<br>

Goates, Audrey: and how Audrey am I the man yet?<br>

Doth my simple feature content you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aud. Your features, Lord warrant vs: what features?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I am heere with thee, and thy Goats, as the most<br>

capricious Poet honest Ouid was among the Gothes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07079">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. O knowledge ill inhabited, worse then Ioue in<br>

a thatch'd house<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07080"> Clo. When a mans verses cannot be vnderstood, nor
a mans good wit seconded with the forward childe, vnderstanding:
it strikes a man more dead then a great reckoning
in a little roome: truly, I would the Gods hadde
made thee poeticall</p><br>

<p id="id07081"> Aud. I do not know what Poetical is: is it honest in
deed and word: is it a true thing?
 Clo. No trulie: for the truest poetrie is the most faining,
and Louers are giuen to Poetrie: and what they
sweare in Poetrie, may be said as Louers, they do feigne</p><br>

<p id="id07082">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aud. Do you wish then that the Gods had made me<br>

Poeticall?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. I do truly: for thou swear'st to me thou art honest:<br>

Now if thou wert a Poet, I might haue some hope<br>

thou didst feigne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07083">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aud. Would you not haue me honest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. No truly, vnlesse thou wert hard fauour'd: for<br>

honestie coupled to beautie, is to haue Honie a sawce to<br>

Sugar<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07084"> Iaq. A materiall foole</p><br>

<p id="id07085">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aud. Well, I am not faire, and therefore I pray the<br>

Gods make me honest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07086">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Truly, and to cast away honestie vppon a foule<br>

slut, were to put good meate into an vncleane dish<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07087">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aud. I am not a slut, though I thanke the Goddes I<br>

am foule<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07088"> Clo. Well, praised be the Gods, for thy foulnesse; sluttishnesse
may come heereafter. But be it, as it may bee,
I wil marrie thee: and to that end, I haue bin with Sir
Oliuer Mar-text, the Vicar of the next village, who hath
promis'd to meete me in this place of the Forrest, and to
couple vs</p><br>

<p id="id07089"> Iaq. I would faine see this meeting</p><br>

<p id="id07090"> Aud. Wel, the Gods giue vs ioy</p><br>

<p id="id07091"> Clo. Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart,
stagger in this attempt: for heere wee haue no Temple
but the wood, no assembly but horne-beasts. But what
though? Courage. As hornes are odious, they are necessarie.
It is said, many a man knowes no end of his goods;
right: Many a man has good Hornes, and knows no end
of them. Well, that is the dowrie of his wife, 'tis none
of his owne getting; hornes, euen so poore men alone:
No, no, the noblest Deere hath them as huge as the Rascall:
Is the single man therefore blessed? No, as a wall'd
Towne is more worthier then a village, so is the forehead
of a married man, more honourable then the bare
brow of a Batcheller: and by how much defence is better
then no skill, by so much is a horne more precious
then to want.
Enter Sir Oliuer Mar-text.</p><br>

<p id="id07092">Heere comes Sir Oliuer: Sir Oliuer Mar-text you are
wel met. Will you dispatch vs heere vnder this tree, or
shal we go with you to your Chappell?
 Ol. Is there none heere to giue the woman?
 Clo. I wil not take her on guift of any man</p><br>

<p id="id07093" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ol. Truly she must be giuen, or the marriage is not

heere Sir: Nay, pray be couer'd</p><br>

<p id="id07096">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Wil you be married, Motley?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. As the Oxe hath his bow sir, the horse his curb,<br>

Pigeons bill, so wedlocke would be nibling<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07097"> Iaq. And wil you (being a man of your breeding) be
married vnder a bush like a begger? Get you to church,
and haue a good Priest that can tel you what marriage is,
this fellow wil but ioyne you together, as they ioyne
Wainscot, then one of you wil proue a shrunke pannell,

<p id="id07098"> Clo. I am not in the minde, but I were better to bee

that teares do not become a man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But haue I not cause to weepe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. As good cause as one would desire,<br>

Therefore weepe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07108">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. His very haire<br>

Is of the dissembling colour<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07109">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Something browner then Iudasses:<br>

Marrie his kisses are Iudasses owne children<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07110"> Ros. I'faith his haire is of a good colour</p><br>

<p id="id07111">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. An excellent colour:<br>

Your Chessenut was euer the onely colour:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. And his kissing is as ful of sanctitie,<br>

As the touch of holy bread<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07112"> Cel. Hee hath bought a paire of cast lips of Diana: a
Nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiouslie,
the very yce of chastity is in them</p><br>

<p id="id07113">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa. But why did hee sweare hee would come this<br>

morning, and comes not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Nay certainly there is no truth in him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07114">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Doe you thinke so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Yes, I thinke he is not a picke purse, nor a horse-stealer,<br>

but for his verity in loue, I doe thinke him as<br>

concaue as a couered goblet, or a Worme-eaten nut<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07115">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Not true in loue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Yes, when he is in, but I thinke he is not in<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07116"> Ros. You haue heard him sweare downright he was</p><br>

<p id="id07117"> Cel. Was, is not is: besides, the oath of Louer is no
stronger then the word of a Tapster, they are both the
confirmer of false reckonings, he attends here in the forrest
on the Duke your father</p><br>

<p id="id07118"> Ros. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question
with him: he askt me of what parentage I was; I
told him of as good as he, so he laugh'd and let mee goe.
But what talke wee of Fathers, when there is such a man
as Orlando?
 Cel. O that's a braue man, hee writes braue verses,
speakes braue words, sweares braue oathes, and breakes
them brauely, quite trauers athwart the heart of his louer,
as a puisny Tilter, y spurs his horse but on one side,
breakes his staffe like a noble goose; but all's braue that
youth mounts, and folly guides: who comes heere?
Enter Corin.</p><br>

<p id="id07119">&nbsp;&nbsp;Corin. Mistresse and Master, you haue oft enquired<br>

After the Shepheard that complain'd of loue,<br>

Who you saw sitting by me on the Turph,<br>

Praising the proud disdainfull Shepherdesse<br>

That was his Mistresse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07120">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Well: and what of him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cor. If you will see a pageant truely plaid<br>

Betweene the pale complexion of true Loue,<br>

And the red glowe of scorne and prowd disdaine,<br>

Goe hence a little, and I shall conduct you<br>

If you will marke it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07121">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. O come, let vs remoue,<br>

In bitternesse; the common executioner<br>

Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard<br>

Falls not the axe vpon the humbled neck,<br>

But first begs pardon: will you sterner be<br>

Then he that dies and liues by bloody drops?<br>

Enter Rosalind, Celia, and Corin.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07126">&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. I would not be thy executioner,<br>

I flye thee, for I would not iniure thee:<br>

Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye,<br>

'Tis pretty sure, and very probable,<br>

That eyes that are the frailst, and softest things,<br>

Who shut their coward gates on atomyes,<br>

Should be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers.<br>

Now I doe frowne on thee with all my heart,<br>

And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:<br>

Now counterfeit to swound, why now fall downe,<br>

Or if thou canst not, oh for shame, for shame,<br>

Lye not, to say mine eyes are murtherers:<br>

Now shew the wound mine eye hath made in thee,<br>

Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remaines<br>

Some scarre of it: Leane vpon a rush<br>

The Cicatrice and capable impressure<br>

Thy palme some moment keepes: but now mine eyes<br>

Which I haue darted at thee, hurt thee not,<br>

Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes<br>

That can doe hurt<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07127">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. O deere Phebe,<br>

If euer (as that euer may be neere)<br>

You meet in some fresh cheeke the power of fancie,<br>

Then shall you know the wounds inuisible<br>

That Loues keene arrows make<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. But till that time<br>

Come not thou neere me: and when that time comes,<br>

Afflict me with thy mockes, pitty me not,<br>

As till that time I shall not pitty thee<br>

That you insult, exult, and all at once<br>

Ouer the wretched? what though you haue no beauty<br>

As by my faith, I see no more in you<br>

Then without Candle may goe darke to bed:<br>

Must you be therefore prowd and pittilesse?<br>

Why what meanes this? why do you looke on me?<br>

I see no more in you then in the ordinary<br>

Of Natures sale-worke? 'ods my little life,<br>

I thinke she meanes to tangle my eies too:<br>

No faith proud Mistresse, hope not after it,<br>

'Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke silke haire,<br>

Your bugle eye-balls, nor your cheeke of creame<br>

That can entame my spirits to your worship:<br>

You foolish Shepheard, wherefore do you follow her<br>

Like foggy South, puffing with winde and raine,<br>

You are a thousand times a properer man<br>

Then she a woman. 'Tis such fooles as you<br>

That makes the world full of ill-fauourd children:<br>

'Tis not her glasse, but you that flatters her,<br>

And out of you she sees her selfe more proper<br>

Then any of her lineaments can show her:<br>

But Mistris, know your selfe, downe on your knees<br>

And thanke heauen, fasting, for a good mans loue;<br>

For I must tell you friendly in your eare,<br>

Sell when you can, you are not for all markets:<br>

Cry the man mercy, loue him, take his offer,<br>

Foule is most foule, being foule to be a scoffer.<br>

So take her to thee Shepheard, fareyouwell<br>

Fall in loue with my anger. If it be so, as fast<br>

As she answeres thee with frowning lookes, ile sauce<br>

Her with bitter words: why looke you so vpon me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. For no ill will I beare you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07132">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I pray you do not fall in loue with mee,<br>

For I am falser then vowes made in wine:<br>

'Tis at the tufft of Oliues, here hard by:<br>

Will you goe Sister? Shepheard ply her hard:<br>

Come Sister: Shepheardesse, looke on him better<br>

And be not proud, though all the world could see,<br>

None could be so abus'd in sight as hee.<br>

Come, to our flocke,<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id07133">&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Dead Shepheard, now I find thy saw of might,<br>

Who euer lov'd, that lou'd not at first sight?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Sweet Phebe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07134">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Hah: what saist thou Siluius?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Sweet Phebe pitty me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07135"> Phe. Why I am sorry for thee gentle Siluius</p><br>

<p id="id07136">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Where euer sorrow is, reliefe would be:<br>

If you doe sorrow at my griefe in loue,<br>

By giuing loue your sorrow, and my griefe<br>

Were both extermin'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07137">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Thou hast my loue, is not that neighbourly?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. I would haue you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Why that were couetousnesse:<br>

Siluius; the time was, that I hated thee;<br>

And yet it is not, that I beare thee loue,<br>

But since that thou canst talke of loue so well,<br>

Thy company, which erst was irkesome to me<br>

I will endure; and Ile employ thee too:<br>

But doe not looke for further recompence<br>

Then thine owne gladnesse, that thou art employd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. So holy, and so perfect is my loue,<br>

And I in such a pouerty of grace,<br>

That I shall thinke it a most plenteous crop<br>

To gleane the broken eares after the man<br>

That the maine haruest reapes: loose now and then<br>

A scattred smile, and that Ile liue vpon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Knowst thou the youth that spoke to mee yerewhile?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Not very well, but I haue met him oft,<br>

And he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds<br>

That the old Carlot once was Master of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07141">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him,<br>

'Tis but a peeuish boy, yet he talkes well,<br>

But what care I for words? yet words do well<br>

When he that speakes them pleases those that heare:<br>

It is a pretty youth, not very prettie,<br>

But sure hee's proud, and yet his pride becomes him;<br>

Hee'll make a proper man: the best thing in him<br>

Is his complexion: and faster then his tongue<br>

Did make offence, his eye did heale it vp:<br>

He is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee's tall:<br>

His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well:<br>

There was a pretty rednesse in his lip,<br>

A little riper, and more lustie red<br>

Then that mixt in his cheeke: 'twas iust the difference<br>

Betwixt the constant red, and mingled Damaske.<br>

There be some women Siluius, had they markt him<br>

In parcells as I did, would haue gone neere<br>

To fall in loue with him: but for my part<br>

I loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet<br>

Haue more cause to hate him then to loue him,<br>

For what had he to doe to chide at me?<br>

He said mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke,<br>

And now I am remembred, scorn'd at me:<br>

I maruell why I answer'd not againe,<br>

But that's all one: omittance is no quittance:<br>

Ile write to him a very tanting Letter,<br>

And thou shalt beare it, wilt thou Siluius?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. Phebe, with all my heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07142">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe. Ile write it strait:<br>

The matter's in my head, and in my heart,<br>

I will be bitter with him, and passing short;<br>

Goe with me Siluius.<br>

<p id="id07146" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Iaq. I prethee, pretty youth, let me better acquainted
with thee</p><br>

<p id="id07147"> Ros They say you are a melancholly fellow</p><br>

<p id="id07148"> Iaq. I am so: I doe loue it better then laughing</p><br>

<p id="id07149"> Ros. Those that are in extremity of either, are abhominable
fellowes, and betray themselues to euery moderne
censure, worse then drunkards</p><br>

<p id="id07150"> Iaq. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing</p><br>

<p id="id07151"> Ros. Why then 'tis good to be a poste</p><br>

<p id="id07152"> Iaq. I haue neither the Schollers melancholy, which
is emulation: nor the Musitians, which is fantasticall;
nor the Courtiers, which is proud: nor the Souldiers,
which is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick:
nor the Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which
is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine owne, compounded
of many simples, extracted from many obiects,
and indeed the sundrie contemplation of my trauells, in
which by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous
sadnesse</p><br>

<p id="id07153"> Ros. A Traueller: by my faith you haue great reason
to be sad: I feare you haue sold your owne Lands,
to see other mens; then to haue seene much, and to haue
nothing, is to haue rich eyes and poore hands</p><br>

<p id="id07154">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. Yes, I haue gain'd my experience.<br>

Enter Orlando.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07155"> Ros. And your experience makes you sad: I had rather
haue a foole to make me merrie, then experience to
make me sad, and to trauaile for it too</p><br>

<p id="id07156"> Orl. Good day, and happinesse, deere Rosalind</p><br>

verse</p><br>

<p id="id07158"> Ros. Farewell Mounsieur Trauellor: looke you
lispe, and weare strange suites; disable all the benefits
of your owne Countrie: be out of loue with your
natiuitie, and almost chide God for making you that
countenance you are; or I will scarce thinke you haue
swam in a Gundello. Why how now Orlando, where
haue you bin all this while? you a louer? and you
serue me such another tricke, neuer come in my sight
more</p><br>

<p id="id07159" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Orl. My faire Rosalind, I come within an houre of my

<p id="id07160"> Ros. Breake an houres promise in loue? hee that
will diuide a minute into a thousand parts, and breake
but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs
of loue, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapt
him oth' shoulder, but Ile warrant him heart hole</p><br>

<p id="id07161"> Orl. Pardon me deere Rosalind</p><br>

<p id="id07162" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ros. Nay, and you be so tardie, come no more in my
sight, I had as liefe be woo'd of a Snaile</p><br>

<p id="id07163"> Orl. Of a Snaile?
 Ros. I, of a Snaile: for though he comes slowly, hee
carries his house on his head; a better ioyncture I thinke
then you make a woman: besides, he brings his destinie
with him</p><br>

<p id="id07164">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. What's that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Why hornes: w such as you are faine to be beholding<br>

to your wiues for: but he comes armed in his<br>

fortune, and preuents the slander of his wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07165">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Vertue is no horne-maker: and my Rosalind is<br>

vertuous<br>

<p id="id07166"> Ros. And I am your Rosalind</p><br>

<p id="id07167" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cel. It pleases him to call you so: but he hath a Rosalind
of a better leere then you</p><br>

<p id="id07168"> Ros. Come, wooe me, wooe mee: for now I am in a
holy-day humor, and like enough to consent: What
would you say to me now, and I were your verie, verie
Rosalind?
 Orl. I would kisse before I spoke</p><br>

<p id="id07169"> Ros. Nay, you were better speake first, and when you
were grauel'd, for lacke of matter, you might take occasion
to kisse: verie good Orators when they are out,
they will spit, and for louers, lacking (God warne vs)
matter, the cleanliest shift is to kisse</p><br>

<p id="id07170">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. How if the kisse be denide?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Then she puts you to entreatie, and there begins<br>

new matter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Who could be out, being before his beloued<br>

Mistris?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Marrie that should you if I were your Mistris,<br>

or I should thinke my honestie ranker then my wit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07172">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. What, of my suite?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Not out of your apparrell, and yet out of your<br>

suite:<br>

Am not I your Rosalind?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I take some ioy to say you are, because I would<br>

be talking of her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07173"> Ros. Well, in her person, I say I will not haue you</p><br>

<p id="id07174"> Orl. Then in mine owne person, I die</p><br>

<p id="id07175"> Ros. No faith, die by Attorney: the poore world is
almost six thousand yeeres old, and in all this time there
was not anie man died in his owne person (videlicet) in
a loue cause: Troilous had his braines dash'd out with a
Grecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before,
and he is one of the patternes of loue. Leander, he would
haue liu'd manie a faire yeere though Hero had turn'd
Nun; if it had not bin for a hot Midsomer-night, for
(good youth) he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont,
and being taken with the crampe, was droun'd,
and the foolish Chronoclers of that age, found it was
Hero of Cestos. But these are all lies, men haue died
from time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not
for loue</p><br>

<p id="id07176" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Orl. I would not haue my right Rosalind of this mind,
for I protest her frowne might kill me</p><br>

<p id="id07177"> Ros. By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come,
now I will be your Rosalind in a more comming-on disposition:
and aske me what you will, I will grant it</p><br>

<p id="id07178"> Orl. Then loue me Rosalind</p><br>

<p id="id07179"> Ros. Yes faith will I, fridaies and saterdaies, and all</p><br>

<p id="id07180">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. And wilt thou haue me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I, and twentie such<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07181">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. What saiest thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Are you not good?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I hope so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07182"> Rosalind. Why then, can one desire too much of a
good thing: Come sister, you shall be the Priest, and
marrie vs: giue me your hand Orlando: What doe you
say sister?
 Orl. Pray thee marrie vs</p><br>

<p id="id07183"> Cel. I cannot say the words</p><br>

<p id="id07184"> Ros. You must begin, will you Orlando</p><br>

<p id="id07185">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Goe too: wil you Orlando, haue to wife this Rosalind?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07186">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I, but when?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. Why now, as fast as she can marrie vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07187">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Then you must say, I take thee Rosalind for<br>

wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07188"> Orl. I take thee Rosalind for wife</p><br>

<p id="id07189"> Ros. I might aske you for your Commission,
But I doe take thee Orlando for my husband: there's a
girle goes before the Priest, and certainely a Womans
thought runs before her actions</p><br>

<p id="id07190"> Orl. So do all thoughts, they are wing'd</p><br>

<p id="id07191">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Now tell me how long you would haue her, after<br>

you haue possest her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. For euer, and a day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07192"> Ros. Say a day, without the euer: no, no Orlando, men
are Aprill when they woe, December when they wed:
Maides are May when they are maides, but the sky changes
when they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of
thee, then a Barbary cocke-pidgeon ouer his hen, more
clamorous then a Parrat against raine, more new-fangled
then an ape, more giddy in my desires, then a monkey:
I will weepe for nothing, like Diana in the Fountaine,
&amp; I wil do that when you are dispos'd to be merry:
I will laugh like a Hyen, and that when thou art inclin'd
to sleepe</p><br>

<p id="id07193">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. But will my Rosalind doe so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. By my life, she will doe as I doe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07194"> Orl. O but she is wise</p><br>

<p id="id07195"> Ros. Or else shee could not haue the wit to doe this:
the wiser, the waywarder: make the doores vpon a womans
wit, and it will out at the casement: shut that, and
'twill out at the key-hole: stop that, 'twill flie with the
smoake out at the chimney</p><br>

<p id="id07196">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might<br>

say, wit whether wil't?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Nay, you might keepe that checke for it, till you<br>

met your wiues wit going to your neighbours bed<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07197"> Orl. And what wit could wit haue, to excuse that?
 Rosa. Marry to say, she came to seeke you there: you
shall neuer take her without her answer, vnlesse you take
her without her tongue: o that woman that cannot
make her fault her husbands occasion, let her neuer nurse
her childe her selfe, for she will breed it like a foole</p><br>

<p id="id07198"> Orl. For these two houres Rosalinde, I wil leaue thee</p><br>

<p id="id07199"> Ros. Alas, deere loue, I cannot lacke thee two houres</p><br>

<p id="id07200">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I must attend the Duke at dinner, by two a clock<br>

I will be with thee againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07201"> Ros. I, goe your waies, goe your waies: I knew what
you would proue, my friends told mee as much, and I
thought no lesse: that flattering tongue of yours wonne
me: 'tis but one cast away, and so come death: two o'
clocke is your howre</p><br>

<p id="id07202"> Orl. I, sweet Rosalind</p><br>

<p id="id07203"> Ros. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God
mend mee, and by all pretty oathes that are not dangerous,
if you breake one iot of your promise, or come one
minute behinde your houre, I will thinke you the most
patheticall breake-promise, and the most hollow louer,
and the most vnworthy of her you call Rosalinde, that

such offenders, and let time try: adieu.
Enter.</p><br>

to her owne neast</p><br>

<p id="id07207"> Ros. O coz, coz, coz: my pretty little coz, that thou
didst know how many fathome deepe I am in loue: but
it cannot bee sounded: my affection hath an vnknowne
bottome, like the Bay of Portugall</p><br>

<p id="id07208" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cel. Or rather bottomlesse, that as fast as you poure
affection in, it runs out</p><br>

<p id="id07209"> Ros. No, that same wicked Bastard of Venus, that was
begot of thought, conceiu'd of spleene, and borne of
madnesse, that blinde rascally boy, that abuses euery
ones eyes, because his owne are out, let him bee iudge,
how deepe I am in loue: ile tell thee Aliena, I cannot be
out of the sight of Orlando: Ile goe finde a shadow, and
sigh till he come</p><br>

His Leather skin, and hornes to weare:<br>

To sleepe: looke who comes heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. My errand is to you, faire youth,<br>

My gentle Phebe, did bid me giue you this:<br>

I know not the contents, but as I guesse<br>

By the sterne brow, and waspish action<br>

Which she did vse, as she was writing of it,<br>

It beares an angry tenure; pardon me,<br>

I am but as a guiltlesse messenger<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07226">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Patience her selfe would startle at this letter,<br>

And play the swaggerer, beare this, beare all:<br>

Shee saies I am not faire, that I lacke manners,<br>

She calls me proud, and that she could not loue me<br>

Were man as rare as Phenix: 'od's my will,<br>

Her loue is not the Hare that I doe hunt,<br>

Why writes she so to me? well Shepheard, well,<br>

This is a Letter of your owne deuice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. No, I protest, I know not the contents,<br>

Phebe did write it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07228">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Come, come, you are a foole,<br>

And turn'd into the extremity of loue.<br>

I saw her hand, she has a leatherne hand,<br>

A freestone coloured hand: I verily did thinke<br>

That her old gloues were on, but twas her hands:<br>

She has a huswiues hand, but that's no matter:<br>

I say she neuer did inuent this letter,<br>

This is a mans inuention, and his hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07229"> Sil. Sure it is hers</p><br>

<p id="id07230">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile,<br>

A stile for challengers: why, she defies me,<br>

Like Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine<br>

Could not drop forth such giant rude inuention,<br>

Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect<br>

Then in their countenance: will you heare the letter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sil. So please you, for I neuer heard it yet:<br>

Yet heard too much of Phebes crueltie<br>

That could do no vengeance to me.<br>

Meaning me a beast.<br>

If the scorne of your bright eine<br>

Haue power to raise such loue in mine,<br>

Alacke, in me, what strange effect<br>

Would they worke in milde aspect?<br>

Whiles you chid me, I did loue,<br>

How then might your praiers moue?<br>

He that brings this loue to thee,<br>

Little knowes this Loue in me:<br>

And by him seale vp thy minde,<br>

Whether that thy youth and kinde<br>

Will the faithfull offer take<br>

Of me, and all that I can make,<br>

Or else by him my loue denie,<br>

And then Ile studie how to die<br>

<p id="id07237"> Ros. Doe you pitty him? No, he deserues no pitty:
wilt thou loue such a woman? what to make thee an instrument,
and play false straines vpon thee? not to be endur'd.
Well, goe your way to her; (for I see Loue hath
made thee a tame snake) and say this to her; That if she
loue me, I charge her to loue thee: if she will not, I will
neuer haue her, vnlesse thou intreat for her: if you bee a

<p id="id07240">&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliu. Good morrow, faire ones: pray you, (if you | know)<br>

Where in the Purlews of this Forrest, stands<br>

A sheep-coat, fenc'd about with Oliue-trees<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom<br>

The ranke of Oziers, by the murmuring streame<br>

Left on your right hand, brings you to the place:<br>

But at this howre, the house doth keepe it selfe,<br>

There's none within<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07242">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,<br>

Then should I know you by description,<br>

Such garments, and such yeeres: the boy is faire,<br>

Of femall fauour, and bestowes himselfe<br>

Like a ripe sister: the woman low<br>

And browner then her brother: are not you<br>

The owner of the house I did enquire for?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Orlando doth commend him to you both,<br>

And to that youth hee calls his Rosalind,<br>

He sends this bloudy napkin; are you he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I am: what must we vnderstand by this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Some of my shame, if you will know of me<br>

What man I am, and how, and why, and where<br>

This handkercher was stain'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07244"> Cel. I pray you tell it</p><br>

<p id="id07245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. When last the yong Orlando parted from you,<br>

He left a promise to returne againe<br>

Within an houre, and pacing through the Forrest,<br>

Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancie,<br>

Loe what befell: he threw his eye aside,<br>

And marke what obiect did present it selfe<br>

Vnder an old Oake, whose bows were moss'd with age<br>

And high top, bald with drie antiquitie:<br>

A wretched ragged man, ore-growne with haire<br>

Lay sleeping on his back; about his necke<br>

A greene and guilded snake had wreath'd it selfe,<br>

Who with her head, nimble in threats approach'd<br>

The opening of his mouth: but sodainly<br>

Seeing Orlando, it vnlink'd it selfe,<br>

And with indented glides, did slip away<br>

Into a bush, vnder which bushes shade<br>

A Lyonnesse, with vdders all drawne drie,<br>

Lay cowching head on ground, with catlike watch<br>

When that the sleeping man should stirre; for 'tis<br>

The royall disposition of that beast<br>

To prey on nothing, that doth seeme as dead:<br>

This seene, Orlando did approach the man,<br>

And found it was his brother, his elder brother<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07246">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. O I haue heard him speake of that same brother,<br>

And he did render him the most vnnaturall<br>

That liu'd amongst men<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07247">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. And well he might so doe,<br>

For well I know he was vnnaturall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07248">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But to Orlando: did he leaue him there<br>

Food to the suck'd and hungry Lyonnesse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Twice did he turne his backe, and purpos'd so:<br>

But kindnesse, nobler euer then reuenge,<br>

And Nature stronger then his iust occasion,<br>

Made him giue battell to the Lyonnesse:<br>

Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling<br>

From miserable slumber I awaked<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07249">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Are you his brother?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Was't you he rescu'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Was't you that did so oft contriue to kill him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. 'Twas I: but 'tis not I: I doe not shame<br>

To tell you what I was, since my conuersion<br>

So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07250">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. But for the bloody napkin?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. By and by:<br>

When from the first to last betwixt vs two,<br>

Teares our recountments had most kindely bath'd,<br>

As how I came into that Desert place.<br>

In briefe, he led me to the gentle Duke,<br>

Who gaue me fresh aray, and entertainment,<br>

Committing me vnto my brothers loue,<br>

Who led me instantly vnto his Caue,<br>

There stript himselfe, and heere vpon his arme<br>

The Lyonnesse had torne some flesh away,<br>

Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,<br>

And cride in fainting vpon Rosalinde.<br>

Briefe, I recouer'd him, bound vp his wound,<br>

And after some small space, being strong at heart,<br>

He sent me hither, stranger as I am<br>

To tell this story, that you might excuse<br>

His broken promise, and to giue this napkin<br>

Died in this bloud, vnto the Shepheard youth,<br>

That he in sport doth call his Rosalind<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07251"> Cel. Why how now Ganimed, sweet Ganimed</p><br>

<p id="id07252"> Oli. Many will swoon when they do look on bloud</p><br>

<p id="id07253"> Cel. There is more in it; Cosen Ganimed</p><br>

<p id="id07254"> Oli. Looke, he recouers</p><br>

<p id="id07255"> Ros. I would I were at home</p><br>

<p id="id07256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Wee'll lead you thither:<br>

I pray you will you take him by the arme<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07257">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Be of good cheere youth: you a man?<br>

You lacke a mans heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07258">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I doe so, I confesse it:<br>

Ah, sirra, a body would thinke this was well counterfeited,<br>

I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited:<br>

heigh-ho<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07259">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony<br>

in your complexion, that it was a passion of earnest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07260"> Ros. Counterfeit, I assure you</p><br>

<p id="id07261">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to<br>

be a man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07262">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. So I doe: but yfaith, I should haue beene a woman<br>

by right<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07263">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel. Come, you looke paler and paler: pray you draw<br>

homewards: good sir, goe with vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07264">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oli. That will I: for I must beare answere backe<br>

How you excuse my brother, Rosalind<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07265">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. I shall deuise something: but I pray you commend<br>

my counterfeiting to him: will you goe?<br>

The Foole doth thinke he is wise, but the wiseman

when he had a desire to eate a Grape, would open
his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby,
that Grapes were made to eate, and lippes to open.

<p id="id07303">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeyted<br>

<p id="id07304"> Ros. O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there
was neuer any thing so sodaine, but the sight of two
Rammes, and Cesars Thrasonicall bragge of I came, saw,
and ouercome. For your brother, and my sister, no sooner
met, but they look'd: no sooner look'd, but they
lou'd; no sooner lou'd, but they sigh'd: no sooner sigh'd
but they ask'd one another the reason: no sooner knew
the reason, but they sought the remedie: and in these
degrees, haue they made a paire of staires to marriage,
which they will climbe incontinent, or else bee incontinent
before marriage; they are in the verie wrath of
loue, and they will together. Clubbes cannot part
them</p><br>

<p id="id07305"> Orl. They shall be married to morrow: and I will
bid the Duke to the Nuptiall. But O, how bitter a thing
it is, to looke into happines through another mans eies:
by so much the more shall I to morrow be at the height
of heart heauinesse, by how much I shal thinke my brother
happie, in hauing what he wishes for</p><br>

for Rosalind?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orl. I can liue no longer by thinking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07307"> Ros. I will wearie you then no longer with idle talking.
Know of me then (for now I speake to some purpose)
that I know you are a Gentleman of good conceit:
I speake not this, that you should beare a good opinion
of my knowledge: insomuch (I say) I know you are: neither
do I labor for a greater esteeme then may in some
little measure draw a beleefe from you, to do your selfe
good, and not to grace me. Beleeue then, if you please,
that I can do strange things: I haue since I was three
yeare old conuerst with a Magitian, most profound in
his Art, and yet not damnable. If you do loue Rosalinde
so neere the hart, as your gesture cries it out: when your
brother marries Aliena, shall you marrie her. I know into
what straights of Fortune she is driuen, and it is not
impossible to me, if it appeare not inconuenient to you,
to set her before your eyes to morrow, humane as she is,
and without any danger</p><br>

<p id="id07308"> Orl. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
 Ros. By my life I do, which I tender deerly, though
I say I am a Magitian: Therefore put you in your best aray,
bid your friends: for if you will be married to morrow,
you shall: and to Rosalind if you will.

Fooles</p><br>

<p id="id07362"> Clo. Salutation and greeting to you all</p><br>

<p id="id07363"> Iaq. Good my Lord, bid him welcome: This is the
Motley-minded Gentleman, that I haue so often met in
the Forrest: he hath bin a Courtier he sweares</p><br>

<p id="id07364"> Clo. If any man doubt that, let him put mee to my
purgation, I haue trod a measure, I haue flattred a Lady,
I haue bin politicke with my friend, smooth with mine
enemie, I haue vndone three Tailors, I haue had foure
quarrels, and like to haue fought one</p><br>

<p id="id07365">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. And how was that tane vp?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. 'Faith we met, and found the quarrel was vpon<br>

the seuenth cause<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07366">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaq. How seuenth cause? Good my Lord, like this<br>

fellow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07367"> Du.Se. I like him very well</p><br>

<p id="id07368"> Clo. God'ild you sir, I desire you of the like: I presse
in heere sir, amongst the rest of the Country copulatiues
to sweare, and to forsweare, according as mariage binds
and blood breakes: a poore virgin sir, an il-fauor'd thing
sir, but mine owne, a poore humour of mine sir, to take
that that no man else will: rich honestie dwels like a miser
sir, in a poore house, as your Pearle in your foule oyster</p><br>

<p id="id07369">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du.Se. By my faith, he is very swift, and sententious<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. According to the fooles bolt sir, and such dulcet<br>

diseases<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07370"> Iaq. But for the seuenth cause. How did you finde
the quarrell on the seuenth cause?
 Clo. Vpon a lye, seuen times remoued: (beare your
bodie more seeming Audry) as thus sir: I did dislike the
cut of a certaine Courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I
said his beard was not cut well, hee was in the minde it
was: this is call'd the retort courteous. If I sent him
word againe, it was not well cut, he wold send me word
he cut it to please himselfe: this is call'd the quip modest.
If againe, it was not well cut, he disabled my iudgment:
this is called, the reply churlish. If againe it was not well
cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call'd the
reproofe valiant. If againe, it was not well cut, he wold
say, I lie: this is call'd the counter-checke quarrelsome:
and so to lye circumstantiall, and the lye direct</p><br>

<p id="id07371"> Iaq. And how oft did you say his beard was not well
cut?
 Clo. I durst go no further then the lye circumstantial:
nor he durst not giue me the lye direct: and so wee measur'd
swords, and parted</p><br>

<p id="id07372" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Iaq. Can you nominate in order now, the degrees of
the lye</p><br>

<p id="id07373"> Clo. O sir, we quarrel in print, by the booke: as you
haue bookes for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
The first, the Retort courteous: the second, the
Quip-modest: the third, the reply Churlish: the fourth,
the Reproofe valiant: the fift, the Counterchecke quarrelsome:
the sixt, the Lye with circumstance: the seauenth,
the Lye direct: all these you may auoyd, but the
Lye direct: and you may auoide that too, with an If. I
knew when seuen Iustices could not take vp a Quarrell,
but when the parties were met themselues, one of them
thought but of an If; as if you saide so, then I saide so:
and they shooke hands, and swore brothers. Your If, is
the onely peace-maker: much vertue in if</p><br>

<p id="id07374" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Iaq. Is not this a rare fellow my Lord? He's as good
at any thing, and yet a foole</p><br>

<p id="id07375"> Du.Se. He vses his folly like a stalking-horse, and vnder
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

In his owne conduct, purposely to take<br>

His brother heere, and put him to the sword:<br>

And to the skirts of this wilde Wood he came;<br>

Where, meeting with an old Religious man,<br>

After some question with him, was conuerted<br>

Both from his enterprize, and from the world:<br>

His crowne bequeathing to his banish'd Brother,<br>

And all their Lands restor'd to him againe<br>

no bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue.
Yet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good
playes proue the better by the helpe of good Epilogues:
What a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epilogue,
nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a
good play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore
to begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure
you, and Ile begin with the Women. I charge you (O
women) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much
of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men)
for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your
simpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you,
and the women, the play may please. If I were a Woman,
I would kisse as many of you as had beards that
pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that
I defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good

<p id="id07501">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Oh Tranio, till I found it to be true,<br>

I neuer thought it possible or likely.<br>

But see, while idely I stood looking on,<br>

I found the effect of Loue in idlenesse,<br>

And now in plainnesse do confesse to thee<br>

Such as the daughter of Agenor had,<br>

That made great Ioue to humble him to her hand,<br>

When with his knees he kist the Cretan strond<br>

I pray awake sir: if you loue the Maide,<br>

Bend thoughts and wits to atcheeue her. Thus it stands:<br>

Her elder sister is so curst and shrew'd,<br>

That til the Father rid his hands of her,<br>

For man or master: then it followes thus;<br>

Thou shalt be master, Tranio in my sted:<br>

Keepe house, and port, and seruants, as I should,<br>

I will some other be, some Florentine,<br>

Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.<br>

'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so: Tranio at once<br>

Vncase thee: take my Coulord hat and cloake,<br>

When Biondello comes, he waites on thee,<br>

But I will charme him first to keepe his tongue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07516">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. So had you neede:<br>

In breefe Sir, sith it your pleasure is,<br>

And I am tyed to be obedient,<br>

For so your father charg'd me at our parting:<br>

Be seruiceable to my sonne (quoth he)<br>

Although I thinke 'twas in another sense,<br>

I am content to bee Lucentio,<br>

Because so well I loue Lucentio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07517">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Tranio be so, because Lucentio loues,<br>

And let me be a slaue, t' atchieue that maide,<br>

Whose sodaine sight hath thral'd my wounded eye.<br>

Enter Biondello.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07518">Heere comes the rogue. Sirra, where haue you bin?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. Where haue I beene? Nay how now, where<br>

are you? Maister, ha's my fellow Tranio stolne your<br>

cloathes, or you stolne his, or both? Pray what's the<br>

newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Sirra come hither, 'tis no time to iest,<br>

And therefore frame your manners to the time<br>

Your fellow Tranio heere to saue my life,<br>

Puts my apparrell, and my count'nance on,<br>

And I for my escape haue put on his:<br>

For in a quarrell since I came a-shore,<br>

I kil'd a man, and feare I was descried:<br>

Waite you on him, I charge you, as becomes:<br>

While I make way from hence to saue my life:<br>

You vnderstand me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. I sir, ne're a whit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07519">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. And not a iot of Tranio in your mouth,<br>

Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07520"> Bion. The better for him, would I were so too</p><br>

<p id="id07521"> Tra. So could I 'faith boy, to haue the next wish after,
that Lucentio indeede had Baptistas yongest daughter.
But sirra, not for my sake, but your masters, I aduise
you vse your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, why then I am Tranio: but in
all places else, your master Lucentio</p><br>

<p id="id07522">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Tranio let's go:<br>

One thing more rests, that thy selfe execute,<br>

To make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,<br>

Sufficeth my reasons are both good and waighty.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07523">Exeunt. The Presenters aboue speakes.</p><br>

<p id="id07529">&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Verona, for a while I take my leaue,<br>

To see my friends in Padua; but of all<br>

My best beloued and approued friend<br>

Hortensio: &amp; I trow this is his house:<br>

Heere sirra Grumio, knocke I say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07530">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Knocke sir? whom should I knocke? Is there<br>

any man ha's rebus'd your worship?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Villaine I say, knocke me heere soundly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07531">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Knocke you heere sir? Why sir, what am I sir,<br>

that I should knocke you heere sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07532">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Villaine I say, knocke me at this gate,<br>

And rap me well, or Ile knocke your knaues pate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07533">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. My Mr is growne quarrelsome:<br>

I should knocke you first,<br>

And then I know after who comes by the worst<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07534">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Will it not be?<br>

'Faith sirrah, and you'l not knocke, Ile ring it,<br>

Ile trie how you can Sol, Fa, and sing it.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07535">He rings him by the eares</p><br>

<p id="id07536"> Gru. Helpe mistris helpe, my master is mad</p><br>

<p id="id07537">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Now knocke when I bid you: sirrah villaine.<br>

Enter Hortensio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07538">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. How now, what's the matter? My olde friend<br>

Grumio, and my good friend Petruchio? How do you all<br>

at Verona?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?<br>

Contutti le core bene trobatto, may I say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07539">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Alla nostra casa bene venuto multo honorata signior<br>

mio Petruchio.<br>

Rise Grumio rise, we will compound this quarrell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07540"> Gru. Nay 'tis no matter sir, what he leges in Latine.
If this be not a lawfull cause for me to leaue his seruice,
looke you sir: He bid me knocke him, &amp; rap him soundly
sir. Well, was it fit for a seruant to vse his master so,
being perhaps (for ought I see) two and thirty, a peepe
out? Whom would to God I had well knockt at first,
then had not Grumio come by the worst</p><br>

<p id="id07541">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. A sencelesse villaine: good Hortensio,<br>

I bad the rascall knocke vpon your gate,<br>

And could not get him for my heart to do it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07542"> Gru. Knocke at the gate? O heauens: spake you not
these words plaine? Sirra, Knocke me heere: rappe me
heere: knocke me well, and knocke me soundly? And
come you now with knocking at the gate?
 Petr. Sirra be gone, or talke not I aduise you</p><br>

<p id="id07543">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Petruchio patience, I am Grumio's pledge:<br>

Why this a heauie chance twixt him and you,<br>

Your ancient trustie pleasant seruant Grumio:<br>

And tell me now (sweet friend) what happie gale<br>

Blowes you to Padua heere, from old Verona?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Such wind as scatters yongmen throgh y world,<br>

To seeke their fortunes farther then at home,<br>

Where small experience growes but in a few.<br>

Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me,<br>

Antonio my father is deceast,<br>

And I haue thrust my selfe into this maze,<br>

Happily to wiue and thriue, as best I may:<br>

Crownes in my purse I haue, and goods at home,<br>

And so am come abroad to see the world<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07544">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,<br>

And wish thee to a shrew'd ill-fauour'd wife?<br>

Thou'dst thanke me but a little for my counsell:<br>

And yet Ile promise thee she shall be rich,<br>

And verie rich: but th'art too much my friend,<br>

And Ile not wish thee to her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07545">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as wee,<br>

Few words suffice: and therefore, if thou know<br>

One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife:<br>

(As wealth is burthen of my woing dance)<br>

Be she as foule as was Florentius Loue,<br>

As old as Sibell, and as curst and shrow'd<br>

As Socrates Zentippe, or a worse:<br>

She moues me not, or not remoues at least<br>

Affections edge in me. Were she is as rough<br>

As are the swelling Adriaticke seas.<br>

I come to wiue it wealthily in Padua:<br>

If wealthily, then happily in Padua<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07546"> Gru. Nay looke you sir, hee tels you flatly what his
minde is: why giue him Gold enough, and marrie him
to a Puppet or an Aglet babie, or an old trot with ne're a
tooth in her head, though she haue as manie diseases as
two and fiftie horses. Why nothing comes amisse, so
monie comes withall</p><br>

<p id="id07547">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Petruchio, since we are stept thus farre in,<br>

I will continue that I broach'd in iest,<br>

I can Petruchio helpe thee to a wife<br>

With wealth enough, and yong and beautious,<br>

Brought vp as best becomes a Gentlewoman.<br>

Her onely fault, and that is faults enough,<br>

Is, that she is intollerable curst,<br>

And shrow'd, and froward, so beyond all measure,<br>

That were my state farre worser then it is,<br>

I would not wed her for a mine of Gold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07548">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Hortensio peace: thou knowst not golds effect,<br>

Tell me her fathers name, and 'tis enough:<br>

For I will boord her, though she chide as loud<br>

As thunder, when the clouds in Autumne cracke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07549">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Her father is Baptista Minola,<br>

An affable and courteous Gentleman,<br>

Her name is Katherina Minola,<br>

Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07550">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. I know her father, though I know not her,<br>

And he knew my deceased father well:<br>

I wil not sleepe Hortensio til I see her,<br>

And therefore let me be thus bold with you,<br>

To giue you ouer at this first encounter,<br>

Vnlesse you wil accompanie me thither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07551"> Gru . I pray you Sir let him go while the humor lasts.
A my word, and she knew him as wel as I do, she would
thinke scolding would doe little good vpon him. Shee
may perhaps call him halfe a score Knaues, or so: Why
that's nothing; and he begin once, hee'l raile in his rope
trickes. Ile tell you what sir, and she stand him but a litle,
he wil throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure hir
with it, that shee shal haue no more eies to see withall
then a Cat: you know him not sir</p><br>

<p id="id07552">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Tarrie Petruchio, I must go with thee,<br>

For in Baptistas keepe my treasure is:<br>

He hath the Iewel of my life in hold,<br>

His yongest daughter, beautiful Bianca,<br>

And her with-holds from me. Other more<br>

Suters to her, and riuals in my Loue:<br>

Supposing it a thing impossible,<br>

For those defects I haue before rehearst,<br>

That euer Katherina wil be woo'd:<br>

Therefore this order hath Baptista tane,<br>

That none shal haue accesse vnto Bianca,<br>

Til Katherine the Curst, haue got a husband<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07553">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Katherine the curst,<br>

A title for a maide, of all titles the worst<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07554">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Now shal my friend Petruchio do me grace,<br>

And offer me disguis'd in sober robes,<br>

To old Baptista as a schoole-master<br>

Well seene in Musicke, to instruct Bianca,<br>

That so I may by this deuice at least<br>

Haue leaue and leisure to make loue to her,<br>

And vnsuspected court her by her selfe.<br>

Enter Gremio and Lucentio disguised.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07555"> Gru. Heere's no knauerie. See, to beguile the olde-folkes,
how the young folkes lay their heads together.
Master, master, looke about you: Who goes there? ha</p><br>

<p id="id07556">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Peace Grumio, it is the riuall of my Loue.<br>

Petruchio stand by a while<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07557"> Grumio. A proper stripling, and an amorous</p><br>

<p id="id07558">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gremio. O very well, I haue perus'd the note:<br>

Hearke you sir, Ile haue them verie fairely bound,<br>

All bookes of Loue, see that at any hand,<br>

And see you reade no other Lectures to her:<br>

You vnderstand me. Ouer and beside<br>

Signior Baptistas liberalitie,<br>

Ile mend it with a Largesse. Take your paper too,<br>

And let me haue them verie wel perfum'd;<br>

For she is sweeter then perfume it selfe<br>

To whom they go to: what wil you reade to her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07559">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. What ere I reade to her, Ile pleade for you,<br>

As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,<br>

As firmely as your selfe were still in place,<br>

Yea and perhaps with more successefull words<br>

Then you; vnlesse you were a scholler sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07560"> Gre. Oh this learning, what a thing it is</p><br>

<p id="id07561"> Gru. Oh this Woodcocke, what an Asse it is</p><br>

<p id="id07562"> Petru. Peace sirra</p><br>

<p id="id07563"> Hor. Grumio mum: God saue you signior Gremio</p><br>

<p id="id07564">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. And you are wel met, Signior Hortensio.<br>

Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola,<br>

I promist to enquire carefully<br>

About a schoolemaster for the faire Bianca,<br>

And by good fortune I haue lighted well<br>

On this yong man: For learning and behauiour<br>

Fit for her turne, well read in Poetrie<br>

And other bookes, good ones, I warrant ye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07565">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. 'Tis well: and I haue met a Gentleman<br>

Hath promist me to helpe one to another,<br>

A fine Musitian to instruct our Mistris,<br>

So shal I no whit be behinde in dutie<br>

To faire Bianca, so beloued of me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07566"> Gre. Beloued of me, and that my deeds shal proue</p><br>

<p id="id07567"> Gru. And that his bags shal proue</p><br>

<p id="id07568">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our loue,<br>

Listen to me, and if you speake me faire,<br>

Ile tel you newes indifferent good for either.<br>

Heere is a Gentleman whom by chance I met<br>

Vpon agreement from vs to his liking,<br>

Will vndertake to woo curst Katherine,<br>

Yea, and to marrie her, if her dowrie please<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07569">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. So said, so done, is well:<br>

Hortensio, haue you told him all her faults?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. I know she is an irkesome brawling scold:<br>

If that be all Masters, I heare no harme<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07570">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. No, sayst me so, friend? What Countreyman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Borne in Verona, old Butonios sonne:<br>

My father dead, my fortune liues for me,<br>

And I do hope, good dayes and long, to see<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07571">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Oh sir, such a life with such a wife, were strange:<br>

But if you haue a stomacke, too't a Gods name,<br>

You shal haue me assisting you in all.<br>

But will you woo this Wilde-cat?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Will I liue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Wil he woo her? I: or Ile hang her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07572">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Why came I hither, but to that intent?<br>

Thinke you, a little dinne can daunt mine eares?<br>

Haue I not in my time heard Lions rore?<br>

Haue I not heard the sea, puft vp with windes,<br>

Rage like an angry Boare, chafed with sweat?<br>

Haue I not heard great Ordnance in the field?<br>

And heauens Artillerie thunder in the skies?<br>

Haue I not in a pitched battell heard<br>

Loud larums, neighing steeds, &amp; trumpets clangue?<br>

And do you tell me of a womans tongue?<br>

That giues not halfe so great a blow to heare,<br>

As wil a Chesse-nut in a Farmers fire.<br>

Tush, tush, feare boyes with bugs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07573"> Gru. For he feares none</p><br>

<p id="id07574">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grem. Hortensio hearke:<br>

This Gentleman is happily arriu'd,<br>

My minde presumes for his owne good, and yours<br>

And beare his charge of wooing whatsoere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07576"> Gremio. And so we wil, prouided that he win her</p><br>

<p id="id07577">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. I would I were as sure of a good dinner.<br>

Enter Tranio braue, and Biondello.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07578">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Gentlemen God saue you. If I may be bold<br>

Tell me I beseech you, which is the readiest way<br>

To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. He that ha's the two faire daughters: ist he you<br>

meane?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Euen he Biondello<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07579">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Hearke you sir, you meane not her to-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Perhaps him and her sir, what haue you to do?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Not her that chides sir, at any hand I pray<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07580"> Tranio. I loue no chiders sir: Biondello, let's away</p><br>

<p id="id07581"> Luc. Well begun Tranio</p><br>

<p id="id07582">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Sir, a word ere you go:<br>

Are you a sutor to the Maid you talke of, yea or no?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. And if I be sir, is it any offence?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gremio. No: if without more words you will get you<br>

hence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07583">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Why sir, I pray are not the streets as free<br>

For me, as for you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. But so is not she<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07584"> Tra. For what reason I beseech you</p><br>

<p id="id07585">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. For this reason if you'l kno,<br>

That she's the choise loue of Signior Gremio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07586"> Hor. That she's the chosen of signior Hortensio</p><br>

<p id="id07587">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Softly my Masters: If you be Gentlemen<br>

Do me this right: heare me with patience.<br>

Baptista is a noble Gentleman,<br>

To whom my Father is not all vnknowne,<br>

And were his daughter fairer then she is,<br>

She may more sutors haue, and me for one.<br>

Faire Laedaes daughter had a thousand wooers,<br>

Then well one more may faire Bianca haue;<br>

And so she shall: Lucentio shal make one,<br>

Though Paris came, in hope to speed alone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07588"> Gre. What, this Gentleman will out-talke vs all</p><br>

<p id="id07589"> Luc. Sir giue him head, I know hee'l proue a Iade</p><br>

<p id="id07590">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Hortensio, to what end are all these words?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Sir, let me be so bold as aske you,<br>

Did you yet euer see Baptistas daughter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. No sir, but heare I do that he hath two:<br>

The one, as famous for a scolding tongue,<br>

As is the other, for beauteous modestie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07591"> Petr. Sir, sir, the first's for me, let her go by</p><br>

<p id="id07592">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Yea, leaue that labour to great Hercules,<br>

And let it be more then Alcides twelue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07593">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Sir vnderstand you this of me (insooth)<br>

The yongest daughter whom you hearken for,<br>

Her father keepes from all accesse of sutors,<br>

And will not promise her to any man,<br>

Vntill the elder sister first be wed.<br>

The yonger then is free, and not before<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07594">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tranio. If it be so sir, that you are the man<br>

Must steed vs all, and me amongst the rest:<br>

And if you breake the ice, and do this seeke,<br>

Atchieue the elder: set the yonger free,<br>

For our accesse, whose hap shall be to haue her,<br>

Wil not so gracelesse be, to be ingrate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07595">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Sir you say wel, and wel you do conceiue,<br>

And since you do professe to be a sutor,<br>

You must as we do, gratifie this Gentleman,<br>

To whom we all rest generally beholding<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07596">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tranio. Sir, I shal not be slacke, in signe whereof,<br>

Please ye we may contriue this afternoone,<br>

And quaffe carowses to our Mistresse health,<br>

And do as aduersaries do in law,<br>

Striue mightily, but eate and drinke as friends<br>

I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day,<br>

And for your loue to her, leade Apes in hell.<br>

Talke not to me, I will go sit and weepe,<br>

Till I can finde occasion of reuenge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07614">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Was euer Gentleman thus greeu'd as I?<br>

But who comes heere.<br>

Enter Gremio, Lucentio, in the habit of a meane man, Petruchio<br>

with<br>

Tranio, with his boy bearing a Lute and Bookes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07615"> Gre. Good morrow neighbour Baptista</p><br>

<p id="id07616">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Good morrow neighbour Gremio: God saue<br>

you Gentlemen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07617">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. And you good sir: pray haue you not a daughter,<br>

cal'd Katerina, faire and vertuous<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07618"> Bap. I haue a daughter sir, cal'd Katerina</p><br>

<p id="id07619"> Gre. You are too blunt, go to it orderly</p><br>

<p id="id07620">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. You wrong me signior Gremio, giue me leaue.<br>

I am a Gentleman of Verona sir,<br>

That hearing of her beautie, and her wit,<br>

Her affability and bashfull modestie:<br>

Her wondrous qualities, and milde behauiour,<br>

Am bold to shew my selfe a forward guest<br>

Within your house, to make mine eye the witnesse<br>

Of that report, which I so oft haue heard,<br>

And for an entrance to my entertainment,<br>

I do present you with a man of mine<br>

Cunning in Musicke, and the Mathematickes,<br>

To instruct her fully in those sciences,<br>

Whereof I know she is not ignorant,<br>

Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.<br>

His name is Litio, borne in Mantua<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07621">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Y'are welcome sir, and he for your good sake.<br>

But for my daughter Katerine, this I know,<br>

She is not for your turne, the more my greefe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07622">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. I see you do not meane to part with her,<br>

Or else you like not of my companie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07623">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Mistake me not, I speake but as I finde,<br>

Whence are you sir? What may I call your name<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07624">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Petruchio is my name, Antonio's sonne,<br>

A man well knowne throughout all Italy<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07625"> Bap. I know him well: you are welcome for his sake</p><br>

<p id="id07626"> Gre. Sauing your tale Petruchio, I pray let vs that are
poore petitioners speake too? Bacare, you are meruaylous
forward</p><br>

<p id="id07627">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Oh, Pardon me signior Gremio, I would faine be<br>

doing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07628">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. I doubt it not sir. But you will curse<br>

Your wooing neighbors: this is a guift<br>

Very gratefull, I am sure of it, to expresse<br>

The like kindnesse my selfe, that haue beene<br>

More kindely beholding to you then any:<br>

Freely giue vnto this yong Scholler, that hath<br>

Beene long studying at Rhemes, as cunning<br>

In Greeke, Latine, and other Languages,<br>

As the other in Musicke and Mathematickes:<br>

His name is Cambio: pray accept his seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07629">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. A thousand thankes signior Gremio:<br>

Welcome good Cambio. But gentle sir,<br>

Me thinkes you walke like a stranger,<br>

May I be so bold, to know the cause of your comming?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Pardon me sir, the boldnesse is mine owne,<br>

That being a stranger in this Cittie heere,<br>

Do make my selfe a sutor to your daughter,<br>

Vnto Bianca, faire and vertuous:<br>

Nor is your firme resolue vnknowne to me,<br>

In the preferment of the eldest sister.<br>

This liberty is all that I request,<br>

That vpon knowledge of my Parentage,<br>

I may haue welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,<br>

And free accesse and fauour as the rest.<br>

And toward the education of your daughters:<br>

I heere bestow a simple instrument,<br>

And this small packet of Greeke and Latine bookes:<br>

If you accept them, then their worth is great:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Lucentio is your name, of whence I pray<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07630"> Tra. Of Pisa sir, sonne to Vincentio</p><br>

<p id="id07631">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. A mightie man of Pisa by report,<br>

I know him well: you are verie welcome sir:<br>

Take you the Lute, and you the set of bookes,<br>

You shall go see your Pupils presently.<br>

Holla, within.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07632">Enter a Seruant</p><br>

<p id="id07633">Sirrah, leade these Gentlemen<br>

To my daughters, and tell them both<br>

These are their Tutors, bid them vse them well,<br>

We will go walke a little in the Orchard,<br>

And then to dinner: you are passing welcome,<br>

And so I pray you all to thinke your selues<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07634">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Signior Baptista, my businesse asketh haste,<br>

And euerie day I cannot come to woo,<br>

You knew my father well, and in him me,<br>

Left solie heire to all his Lands and goods,<br>

Which I haue bettered rather then decreast,<br>

Then tell me, if I get your daughters loue,<br>

What dowrie shall I haue with her to wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07635">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. After my death, the one halfe of my Lands,<br>

And in possession twentie thousand Crownes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07636">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. And for that dowrie, Ile assure her of<br>

Her widdow-hood, be it that she suruiue me<br>

In all my Lands and Leases whatsoeuer,<br>

Let specialties be therefore drawne betweene vs,<br>

That couenants may be kept on either hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07637">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. I, when the speciall thing is well obtain'd,<br>

That is her loue: for that is all in all<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07638">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Why that is nothing: for I tell you father,<br>

I am as peremptorie as she proud minded:<br>

And where two raging fires meete together,<br>

They do consume the thing that feedes their furie.<br>

Though little fire growes great with little winde,<br>

Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:<br>

So I to her, and so she yeelds to me,<br>

For I am rough, and woo not like a babe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07639">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Well maist thou woo, and happy be thy speed:<br>

But be thou arm'd for some vnhappie words<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07640">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. I to the proofe, as Mountaines are for windes,<br>

That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.<br>

Enter Hortensio with his head broke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07641">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. How now my friend, why dost thou looke so<br>

pale?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. For feare I promise you, if I looke pale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07642">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. What, will my daughter proue a good Musitian?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. I thinke she'l sooner proue a souldier,<br>

Iron may hold with her, but neuer Lutes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07643">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Why then thou canst not break her to the Lute?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Why no, for she hath broke the Lute to me:<br>

I did but tell her she mistooke her frets,<br>

And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,<br>

When (with a most impatient diuellish spirit)<br>

Frets call you these? (quoth she) Ile fume with them:<br>

And with that word she stroke me on the head,<br>

And through the instrument my pate made way,<br>

And there I stood amazed for a while,<br>

As on a Pillorie, looking through the Lute,<br>

While she did call me Rascall, Fidler,<br>

And twangling Iacke, with twentie such vilde tearmes,<br>

As had she studied to misvse me so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07644">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Now by the world, it is a lustie Wench,<br>

I loue her ten times more then ere I did,<br>

Oh how I long to haue some chat with her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07645">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Wel go with me, and be not so discomfited.<br>

Proceed in practise with my yonger daughter,<br>

She's apt to learne, and thankefull for good turnes:<br>

Signior Petruchio, will you go with vs,<br>

Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07646">Exit. Manet Petruchio.</p><br>

<p id="id07647">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. I pray you do. Ile attend her heere,<br>

And woo her with some spirit when she comes,<br>

Say that she raile, why then Ile tell her plaine,<br>

She sings as sweetly as a Nightinghale:<br>

Say that she frowne, Ile say she lookes as cleere<br>

As morning Roses newly washt with dew:<br>

Say she be mute, and will not speake a word,<br>

Then Ile commend her volubility,<br>

And say she vttereth piercing eloquence:<br>

If she do bid me packe, Ile giue her thankes,<br>

As though she bid me stay by her a weeke:<br>

If she denie to wed, Ile craue the day<br>

When I shall aske the banes, and when be married.<br>

But heere she comes, and now Petruchio speake.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07648">Enter Katerina</p><br>

<p id="id07649">Good morrow Kate, for thats your name I heare</p><br>

<p id="id07650">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Well haue you heard, but something hard of<br>

hearing:<br>

They call me Katerine, that do talke of me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07651">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. You lye infaith, for you are call'd plaine Kate,<br>

And bony Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst:<br>

But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendome,<br>

Kate of Kate-hall, my super-daintie Kate,<br>

For dainties are all Kates, and therefore Kate<br>

Take this of me, Kate of my consolation,<br>

Hearing thy mildnesse prais'd in euery Towne,<br>

Thy vertues spoke of, and thy beautie sounded,<br>

Yet not so deepely as to thee belongs,<br>

My selfe am moou'd to woo thee for my wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07652">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Mou'd, in good time, let him that mou'd you<br>

hether<br>

Remoue you hence: I knew you at the first<br>

You were a mouable<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07653">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Why, what's a mouable?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. A ioyn'd stoole<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07654"> Pet. Thou hast hit it: come sit on me</p><br>

<p id="id07655"> Kate. Asses are made to beare, and so are you</p><br>

<p id="id07656"> Pet. Women are made to beare, and so are you</p><br>

<p id="id07657"> Kate. No such Iade as you, if me you meane</p><br>

<p id="id07658">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Alas good Kate, I will not burthen thee,<br>

For knowing thee to be but yong and light<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07659">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Too light for such a swaine as you to catch,<br>

And yet as heauie as my waight should be<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07660"> Pet. Shold be, should: buzze</p><br>

<p id="id07661"> Kate. Well tane, and like a buzzard</p><br>

<p id="id07662">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Oh slow-wing'd Turtle, shal a buzard take thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. I for a Turtle, as he takes a buzard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07663">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Come, come you Waspe, y'faith you are too<br>

angrie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07664"> Kate. If I be waspish, best beware my sting</p><br>

<p id="id07665"> Pet. My remedy is then to plucke it out</p><br>

<p id="id07666"> Kate. I, if the foole could finde it where it lies</p><br>

<p id="id07667">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Who knowes not where a Waspe does weare<br>

his sting? In his taile<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07668">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. In his tongue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Whose tongue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07669"> Kate. Yours if you talke of tales, and so farewell</p><br>

<p id="id07670">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. What with my tongue in your taile.<br>

Nay, come againe, good Kate, I am a Gentleman,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. That Ile trie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07671">She strikes him</p><br>

<p id="id07672"> Pet. I sweare Ile cuffe you, if you strike againe</p><br>

<p id="id07673">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. So may you loose your armes,<br>

If you strike me, you are no Gentleman,<br>

And if no Gentleman, why then no armes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07674"> Pet. A Herald Kate? Oh put me in thy bookes</p><br>

<p id="id07675">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. What is your Crest, a Coxcombe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. A comblesse Cocke, so Kate will be my Hen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07676">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. No Cocke of mine, you crow too like a crauen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Nay come Kate, come: you must not looke so<br>

sowre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07677"> Kate. It is my fashion when I see a Crab</p><br>

<p id="id07678" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Pet. Why heere's no crab, and therefore looke not
sowre</p><br>

<p id="id07679"> Kate. There is, there is</p><br>

<p id="id07680"> Pet. Then shew it me</p><br>

<p id="id07681"> Kate. Had I a glasse, I would</p><br>

<p id="id07682"> Pet. What, you meane my face</p><br>

<p id="id07683"> Kate. Well aym'd of such a yong one</p><br>

<p id="id07684"> Pet. Now by S[aint]. George I am too yong for you</p><br>

<p id="id07685"> Kate. Yet you are wither'd</p><br>

<p id="id07686"> Pet. 'Tis with cares</p><br>

<p id="id07687"> Kate. I care not</p><br>

<p id="id07688"> Pet. Nay heare you Kate. Insooth you scape not so</p><br>

<p id="id07689"> Kate. I chafe you if I tarrie. Let me go</p><br>

<p id="id07690">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. No, not a whit, I finde you passing gentle:<br>

'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,<br>

And now I finde report a very liar:<br>

For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,<br>

But slow in speech: yet sweet as spring-time flowers.<br>

Thou canst not frowne, thou canst not looke a sconce,<br>

Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,<br>

Nor hast thou pleasure to be crosse in talke:<br>

But thou with mildnesse entertain'st thy wooers,<br>

With gentle conference, soft, and affable.<br>

Why does the world report that Kate doth limpe?<br>

Oh sland'rous world: Kate like the hazle twig<br>

Is straight, and slender, and as browne in hue<br>

As hazle nuts, and sweeter then the kernels:<br>

Oh let me see thee walke: thou dost not halt<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07691"> Kate. Go foole, and whom thou keep'st command</p><br>

<p id="id07692">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Did euer Dian so become a Groue<br>

As Kate this chamber with her princely gate:<br>

O be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,<br>

And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportfull<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07693">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Where did you study all this goodly speech?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. It is extempore, from my mother wit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07694"> Kate. A witty mother, witlesse else her sonne</p><br>

<p id="id07695">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Am I not wise?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. Yes, keepe you warme<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07696">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Marry so I meane sweet Katherine in thy bed:<br>

And therefore setting all this chat aside,<br>

Thus in plaine termes: your father hath consented<br>

That you shall be my wife; your dowry greed on,<br>

And will you, nill you, I will marry you.<br>

Now Kate, I am a husband for your turne,<br>

For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,<br>

Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,<br>

Thou must be married to no man but me,<br>

Enter Baptista, Gremio, Trayno.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07697">For I am he am borne to tame you Kate,<br>

And bring you from a wilde Kate to a Kate<br>

Conformable as other houshold Kates:<br>

Heere comes your father, neuer make deniall,<br>

I must, and will haue Katherine to my wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07698">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Now Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. How but well sir? how but well?<br>

It were impossible I should speed amisse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07699">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Why how now daughter Katherine, in your dumps?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat. Call you me daughter? now I promise you<br>

You haue shewd a tender fatherly regard,<br>

To wish me wed to one halfe Lunaticke,<br>

A mad-cap ruffian, and a swearing Iacke,<br>

That thinkes with oathes to face the matter out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07700">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Father, 'tis thus, your selfe and all the world<br>

That talk'd of her, haue talk'd amisse of her:<br>

If she be curst, it is for pollicie,<br>

For shee's not froward, but modest as the Doue,<br>

Shee is not hot, but temperate as the morne,<br>

For patience shee will proue a second Grissell,<br>

And Romane Lucrece for her chastitie:<br>

And to conclude, we haue greed so well together,<br>

That vpon sonday is the wedding day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07701"> Kate. Ile see thee hang'd on sonday first</p><br>

<p id="id07702"> Gre. Hark Petruchio, she saies shee'll see thee hang'd first</p><br>

<p id="id07703"> Tra. Is this your speeding? nay the[n] godnight our part</p><br>

<p id="id07704">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Be patient gentlemen, I choose her for my selfe,<br>

If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?<br>

'Tis bargain'd twixt vs twaine being alone,<br>

That she shall still be curst in company.<br>

I tell you 'tis incredible to beleeue<br>

How much she loues me: oh the kindest Kate,<br>

Shee hung about my necke, and kisse on kisse<br>

Shee vi'd so fast, protesting oath on oath,<br>

That in a twinke she won me to her loue.<br>

Oh you are nouices, 'tis a world to see<br>

How tame when men and women are alone,<br>

A meacocke wretch can make the curstest shrew:<br>

Giue me thy hand Kate, I will vnto Venice<br>

To buy apparell 'gainst the wedding day;<br>

Prouide the feast father, and bid the guests,<br>

I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07705">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. I know not what to say, but giue me your ha[n]ds,<br>

God send you ioy, Petruchio, 'tis a match<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07706"> Gre. Tra. Amen say we, we will be witnesses</p><br>

<p id="id07707">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Father, and wife, and gentlemen adieu,<br>

I will to Venice, sonday comes apace,<br>

We will haue rings, and things, and fine array,<br>

And kisse me Kate, we will be married a sonday.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07708">Exit Petruchio and Katherine.</p><br>

<p id="id07709">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Was euer match clapt vp so sodainly?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Faith Gentlemen now I play a marchants part,<br>

And venture madly on a desperate Mart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07710">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Twas a commodity lay fretting by you,<br>

'Twill bring you gaine, or perish on the seas<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07711"> Bap. The gaine I seeke, is quiet me the match</p><br>

<p id="id07712">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch:<br>

But now Baptista, to your yonger daughter,<br>

Now is the day we long haue looked for,<br>

I am your neighbour, and was suter first<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07713">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. And I am one that loue Bianca more<br>

Then words can witnesse, or your thoughts can guesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07714"> Gre. Yongling thou canst not loue so deare as I</p><br>

<p id="id07715"> Tra. Gray-beard thy loue doth freeze</p><br>

<p id="id07716">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. But thine doth frie,<br>

Skipper stand backe, 'tis age that nourisheth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07717"> Tra. But youth in Ladies eyes that florisheth</p><br>

<p id="id07718">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Content you gentlemen, I wil co[m]pound this strife<br>

'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both<br>

That can assure my daughter greatest dower,<br>

Shall haue my Biancas loue.<br>

Say signior Gremio, what can you assure her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. First, as you know, my house within the City<br>

Is richly furnished with plate and gold,<br>

Basons and ewers to laue her dainty hands:<br>

My hangings all of tirian tapestry:<br>

In Iuory cofers I haue stuft my crownes:<br>

In Cypres chests my arras counterpoints,<br>

Costly apparell, tents, and Canopies,<br>

Fine Linnen, Turky cushions bost with pearle,<br>

Vallens of Venice gold, in needle worke:<br>

Pewter and brasse, and all things that belongs<br>

To house or house-keeping: then at my farme<br>

I haue a hundred milch-kine to the pale,<br>

Sixe-score fat Oxen standing in my stalls,<br>

And all things answerable to this portion.<br>

My selfe am strooke in yeeres I must confesse,<br>

And if I die to morrow this is hers,<br>

If whil'st I liue she will be onely mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07719">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. That only came well in: sir, list to me,<br>

I am my fathers heyre and onely sonne,<br>

If I may haue your daughter to my wife,<br>

Ile leaue her houses three or foure as good<br>

Within rich Pisa walls, as any one<br>

Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,<br>

Besides, two thousand Duckets by the yeere<br>

Of fruitfull land, all which shall be her ioynter.<br>

What, haue I pincht you Signior Gremio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Two thousand Duckets by the yeere of land,<br>

My Land amounts not to so much in all:<br>

That she shall haue, besides an Argosie<br>

That now is lying in Marcellus roade:<br>

What, haue I choakt you with an Argosie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Gremio, 'tis knowne my father hath no lesse<br>

Then three great Argosies, besides two Galliasses<br>

And twelue tite Gallies, these I will assure her,<br>

And twice as much what ere thou offrest next<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07720">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Nay, I haue offred all, I haue no more,<br>

And she can haue no more then all I haue,<br>

If you like me, she shall haue me and mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07721">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Why then the maid is mine from all the world<br>

By your firme promise, Gremio is out-vied<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07722">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. I must confesse your offer is the best,<br>

And let your father make her the assurance,<br>

Shee is your owne, else you must pardon me:<br>

If you should die before him, where's her dower?<br>

On sonday next, you know<br>

My daughter Katherine is to be married:<br>

Now on the sonday following, shall Bianca<br>

Be Bride to you, if you make this assurance:<br>

If not, to Signior Gremio:<br>

Set foot vnder thy table: tut, a toy,<br>

An olde Italian foxe is not so kinde my boy.<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id07725">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide,<br>

Yet I haue fac'd it with a card of ten:<br>

'Tis in my head to doe my master good:<br>

I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio<br>

Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio,<br>

And that's a wonder: fathers commonly<br>

Doe get their children: but in this case of woing,<br>

A childe shall get a sire, if I faile not of my cunning.<br>

Your Lecture shall haue leisure for as much<br>

<p id="id07730">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Preposterous Asse that neuer read so farre,<br>

To know the cause why musicke was ordain'd:<br>

Was it not to refresh the minde of man<br>

<p id="id07758">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Signior Lucentio, this is the pointed day<br>

That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,<br>

And yet we heare not of our sonne in Law:<br>

What will be said, what mockery will it be?<br>

To want the Bride-groome when the Priest attends<br>

To speake the ceremoniall rites of marriage?<br>

What saies Lucentio to this shame of ours?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. No shame but mine, I must forsooth be forst<br>

To giue my hand oppos'd against my heart<br>

Vnto a mad-braine rudesby, full of spleene,<br>

Who woo'd in haste, and meanes to wed at leysure:<br>

I told you I, he was a franticke foole,<br>

Hiding his bitter iests in blunt behauiour,<br>

And to be noted for a merry man;<br>

Hee'll wooe a thousand, point the day of marriage,<br>

Make friends, inuite, and proclaime the banes,<br>

Yet neuer meanes to wed where he hath woo'd:<br>

Now must the world point at poore Katherine,<br>

And say, loe, there is mad Petruchio's wife<br>

If it would please him come and marry her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07759">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Patience good Katherine and Baptista too,<br>

Vpon my life Petruchio meanes but well,<br>

What euer fortune stayes him from his word,<br>

Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise,<br>

Though he be merry, yet withall he's honest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07760"> Kate. Would Katherine had neuer seen him though.</p><br>

<p id="id07761">Exit weeping.</p><br>

<p id="id07762">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Goe girle, I cannot blame thee now to weepe,<br>

For such an iniurie would vexe a very saint,<br>

Much more a shrew of impatient humour.<br>

Enter Biondello.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07763">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. Master, master, newes, and such newes as you<br>

neuer heard of,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Is it new and olde too? how may that be?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. Why, is it not newes to heard of Petruchio's comming?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Is he come?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. Why no sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07764">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. What then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. He is comming<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07765">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. When will he be heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. When he stands where I am, and sees you there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07766"> Tra. But say, what to thine olde newes?
 Bion. Why Petruchio is comming, in a new hat and
an old ierkin, a paire of old breeches thrice turn'd; a
paire of bootes that haue beene candle-cases, one buckled,
another lac'd: an olde rusty sword tane out of the
Towne Armory, with a broken hilt, and chapelesse: with
two broken points: his horse hip'd with an olde mothy
saddle, and stirrops of no kindred: besides possest
with the glanders, and like to mose in the chine, troubled
with the Lampasse, infected with the fashions, full
of Windegalls, sped with Spauins, raied with the Yellowes,
past cure of the Fiues, starke spoyl'd with the
Staggers, begnawne with the Bots, Waid in the backe,
and shoulder-shotten, neere leg'd before, and with a
halfe-chekt Bitte, &amp; a headstall of sheepes leather, which
being restrain'd to keepe him from stumbling, hath been
often burst, and now repaired with knots: one girth sixe
times peec'd, and a womans Crupper of velure, which
hath two letters for her name, fairely set down in studs,
and heere and there peec'd with packthred</p><br>

<p id="id07767"> Bap. Who comes with him?
 Bion. Oh sir, his Lackey, for all the world Caparison'd
like the horse: with a linnen stock on one leg, and
a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartred with a red and
blew list; an old hat, &amp; the humor of forty fancies prickt
in't for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparell,
&amp; not like a Christian foot-boy, or a gentlemans Lacky</p><br>

<p id="id07768">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. 'Tis some od humor pricks him to this fashion,<br>

Yet oftentimes he goes but meane apparel'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07769"> Bap. I am glad he's come, howsoere he comes</p><br>

<p id="id07770"> Bion. Why sir, he comes not</p><br>

<p id="id07771">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Didst thou not say hee comes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. Who, that Petruchio came?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. I, that Petruchio came<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07772"> Bion. No sir, I say his horse comes with him on his backe</p><br>

<p id="id07773"> Bap. Why that's all one</p><br>

<p id="id07774"> Bion. Nay by S[aint]. Iamy, I hold you a penny, a horse and
a man is more then one, and yet not many.
Enter Petruchio and Grumio.</p><br>

<p id="id07775">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. You are welcome sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07776"> Petr. And yet I come not well</p><br>

<p id="id07777"> Bap. And yet you halt not</p><br>

<p id="id07778"> Tra. Not so well apparell'd as I wish you were</p><br>

<p id="id07779">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Were it better I should rush in thus:<br>

But where is Kate? where is my louely Bride?<br>

How does my father? gentles methinkes you frowne,<br>

And wherefore gaze this goodly company,<br>

As if they saw some wondrous monument,<br>

Some Commet, or vnusuall prodigie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Why sir, you know this is your wedding day:<br>

First were we sad, fearing you would not come,<br>

Now sadder that you come so vnprouided:<br>

Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,<br>

An eye-sore to our solemne festiuall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07780">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. And tell vs what occasion of import<br>

Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,<br>

And sent you hither so vnlike your selfe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to heare,<br>

Sufficeth I am come to keepe my word,<br>

Though in some part inforced to digresse,<br>

Which at more leysure I will so excuse,<br>

As you shall well be satisfied with all.<br>

But where is Kate? I stay too long from her,<br>

The morning weares, 'tis time we were at Church<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. See not your Bride in these vnreuerent robes,<br>

Goe to my chamber, put on clothes of mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07782"> Pet. Not I, beleeue me, thus Ile visit her</p><br>

<p id="id07783"> Bap. But thus I trust you will not marry her</p><br>

<p id="id07784">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Good sooth euen thus: therefore ha done with words,<br>

To me she's married, not vnto my cloathes:<br>

Could I repaire what she will weare in me,<br>

As I can change these poore accoutrements,<br>

'Twere well for Kate, and better for my selfe.<br>

But what a foole am I to chat with you,<br>

When I should bid good morrow to my Bride?<br>

And seale the title with a louely kisse.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07785">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. He hath some meaning in his mad attire,<br>

We will perswade him be it possible,<br>

To put on better ere he goe to Church<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07786">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Ile after him, and see the euent of this.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07787">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. But sir, Loue concerneth vs to adde<br>

Her fathers liking, which to bring to passe<br>

As before imparted to your worship,<br>

I am to get a man what ere he be,<br>

It skills not much, weele fit him to our turne,<br>

And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,<br>

And make assurance heere in Padua<br>

Of greater summes then I haue promised,<br>

So shall you quietly enioy your hope,<br>

And marry sweet Bianca with consent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07788">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Were it not that my fellow schoolemaster<br>

Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly:<br>

'Twere good me-thinkes to steale our marriage,<br>

Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,<br>

Ile keepe mine owne despite of all the world<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07789">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. That by degrees we meane to looke into,<br>

And watch our vantage in this businesse,<br>

Wee'll ouer-reach the grey-beard Gremio,<br>

The narrow prying father Minola,<br>

The quaint Musician, amorous Litio,<br>

All for my Masters sake Lucentio.<br>

Enter Gremio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07790">Signior Gremio, came you from the Church?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. As willingly as ere I came from schoole<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07791">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. And is the Bride &amp; Bridegroom coming home?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. A bridegroome say you? 'tis a groome indeed,<br>

A grumlling groome, and that the girle shall finde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07792"> Tra. Curster then she, why 'tis impossible</p><br>

<p id="id07793"> Gre. Why hee's a deuill, a deuill, a very fiend</p><br>

<p id="id07794"> Tra. Why she's a deuill, a deuill, the deuils damme</p><br>

<p id="id07795">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. Tut, she's a Lambe, a Doue, a foole to him:<br>

Ile tell you sir Lucentio; when the Priest<br>

Should aske if Katherine should be his wife,<br>

I, by goggs woones quoth he, and swore so loud,<br>

That all amaz'd the Priest let fall the booke,<br>

And as he stoop'd againe to take it vp,<br>

This mad-brain'd bridegroome tooke him such a cuffe,<br>

That downe fell Priest and booke, and booke and Priest,<br>

Now take them vp quoth he, if any list<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07796"> Tra. What said the wench when he rose againe?
 Gre. Trembled and shooke: for why, he stamp'd and
swore, as if the Vicar meant to cozen him: but after many
ceremonies done, hee calls for wine, a health quoth
he, as if he had beene aboord carowsing to his Mates after
a storme, quaft off the Muscadell, and threw the sops
all in the Sextons face: hauing no other reason, but that
his beard grew thinne and hungerly, and seem'd to aske
him sops as hee was drinking: This done, hee tooke the
Bride about the necke, and kist her lips with such a clamorous
smacke, that at the parting all the Church did
eccho: and I seeing this, came thence for very shame, and
after mee I know the rout is comming, such a mad marryage
neuer was before: harke, harke, I heare the minstrels
play.</p><br>

<p id="id07797">Musicke playes.</p><br>

<p id="id07798">Enter Petruchio, Kate, Bianca, Hortensio, Baptista.</p><br>

<p id="id07799">&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Gentlemen &amp; friends, I thank you for your pains,<br>

I know you thinke to dine with me to day,<br>

And haue prepar'd great store of wedding cheere,<br>

But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,<br>

And therefore heere I meane to take my leaue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07800">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Is't possible you will away to night?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. I must away to day before night come,<br>

Make it no wonder: if you knew my businesse,<br>

You would intreat me rather goe then stay:<br>

And honest company, I thanke you all,<br>

That haue beheld me giue away my selfe<br>

To this most patient, sweet, and vertuous wife,<br>

If she had not a spirit to resist<br>

Obey the Bride you that attend on her.<br>

Goe to the feast, reuell and domineere,<br>

Carowse full measure to her maiden-head,<br>

Be madde and merry, or goe hang your selues:<br>

Nay, looke not big, nor stampe, not stare, nor fret,<br>

I will be master of what is mine owne,<br>

Shee is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,<br>

My horse, my oxe, my asse, my any thing,<br>

And heere she stands, touch her who euer dare,<br>

Ile bring mine action on the proudest he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Oh I Curtis I, and therefore fire, fire, cast on no<br>

water<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07829"> Cur. Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported</p><br>

<p id="id07830"> Gru. She was good Curtis before this frost: but thou
know'st winter tames man, woman, and beast: for it
hath tam'd my old master, and my new mistris, and my
selfe fellow Curtis</p><br>

<p id="id07831"> Gru. Away you three inch foole, I am no beast</p><br>

<p id="id07832"> Gru. Am I but three inches? Why thy horne is a foot
and so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire,
or shall I complaine on thee to our mistris, whose hand
(she being now at hand) thou shalt soone feele, to thy
cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office</p><br>

<p id="id07833">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. I prethee good Grumio, tell me, how goes the<br>

world?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. A cold world Curtis in euery office but thine, &amp;<br>

therefore fire: do thy duty, and haue thy dutie, for my<br>

Master and mistris are almost frozen to death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07834">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. There's fire readie, and therefore good Grumio<br>

<p id="id07835">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Why Iacke boy, ho boy, and as much newes as<br>

wilt thou<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07836"> Cur. Come, you are so full of conicatching</p><br>

<p id="id07837"> Gru. Why therefore fire, for I haue caught extreme
cold. Where's the Cooke, is supper ready, the house
trim'd, rushes strew'd, cobwebs swept, the seruingmen
in their new fustian, the white stockings, and euery officer
his wedding garment on? Be the Iackes faire within,
the Gils faire without, the Carpets laide, and euerie
thing in order?
 Cur. All readie: and therefore I pray thee newes</p><br>

<p id="id07838">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. First know my horse is tired, my master &amp; mistris<br>

falne out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07839">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. How?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Out of their saddles into the durt, and thereby<br>

hangs a tale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07840"> Cur. Let's ha't good Grumio</p><br>

<p id="id07841"> Gru. Lend thine eare</p><br>

<p id="id07842"> Cur. Heere</p><br>

<p id="id07843"> Gru. There</p><br>

<p id="id07844"> Cur. This 'tis to feele a tale, not to heare a tale</p><br>

<p id="id07845"> Gru. And therefore 'tis cal'd a sensible tale: and this
Cuffe was but to knocke at your eare, and beseech listning:
now I begin, Inprimis wee came downe a fowle
hill, my Master riding behinde my Mistris</p><br>

<p id="id07846">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. Both of one horse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. What's that to thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. Why a horse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07847"> Gru. Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crost me,
thou shouldst haue heard how her horse fel, and she vnder
her horse: thou shouldst haue heard in how miery a
place, how she was bemoil'd, how hee left her with the
horse vpon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled,
how she waded through the durt to plucke him off
me: how he swore, how she prai'd, that neuer prai'd before:
how I cried, how the horses ranne away, how her
bridle was burst: how I lost my crupper, with manie
things of worthy memorie, which now shall die in obliuion,
and thou returne vnexperienc'd to thy graue</p><br>

<p id="id07848"> Cur. By this reckning he is more shrew than she</p><br>

<p id="id07849"> Gru. I, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
finde when he comes home. But what talke I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Ioseph, Nicholas, Phillip, Walter, Sugersop
and the rest: let their heads bee slickely comb'd,
their blew coats brush'd, and their garters of an indifferent
knit, let them curtsie with their left legges, and not
presume to touch a haire of my Masters horse-taile, till
they kisse their hands. Are they all readie?
 Cur. They are</p><br>

<p id="id07850"> Gru. Call them forth</p><br>

<p id="id07851" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cur. Do you heare ho? you must meete my maister
to countenance my mistris</p><br>

<p id="id07852"> Gru. Why she hath a face of her owne</p><br>

<p id="id07853">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. Who knowes not that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Thou it seemes, that cals for company to countenance<br>

Enter foure or fiue seruingmen.<br>

companions, is all readie, and all things neate?

For then she neuer lookes vpon her lure.<br>

Another way I haue to man my Haggard,<br>

To make her come, and know her Keepers call:<br>

That is, to watch her, as we watch these Kites,<br>

That baite, and beate, and will not be obedient:<br>

She eate no meate to day, nor none shall eate.<br>

Last night she slept not, nor to night she shall not:<br>

This way the Couerlet, another way the sheets:<br>

I, and amid this hurlie I intend,<br>

That all is done in reuerend care of her,<br>

And in conclusion, she shal watch all night,<br>

And if she chance to nod, Ile raile and brawle,<br>

And with the clamor keepe her stil awake:<br>

This is a way to kil a Wife with kindnesse,<br>

And thus Ile curbe her mad and headstrong humor:<br>

<p id="id07946">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Eate it vp all Hortensio, if thou louest mee:<br>

Much good do it vnto thy gentle heart:<br>

Kate eate apace; and now my honie Loue,<br>

Will we returne vnto thy Fathers house,<br>

And reuell it as brauely as the best,<br>

With silken coats and caps, and golden Rings,<br>

With Ruffes and Cuffes, and Fardingales, and things:<br>

With Scarfes, and Fannes, &amp; double change of brau'ry,<br>

With Amber Bracelets, Beades, and all this knau'ry.<br>

What hast thou din'd? The Tailor staies thy leasure,<br>

To decke thy bodie with his ruffling treasure.<br>

Enter Tailor.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07947">Come Tailor, let vs see these ornaments.<br>

Enter Haberdasher.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07948">Lay forth the gowne. What newes with you sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fel. Heere is the cap your Worship did bespeake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07949">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Why this was moulded on a porrenger,<br>

A Veluet dish: Fie, fie, 'tis lewd and filthy,<br>

Why 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,<br>

A knacke, a toy, a tricke, a babies cap:<br>

Away with it, come let me haue a bigger<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07950">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Ile haue no bigger, this doth fit the time,<br>

And Gentlewomen weare such caps as these<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07951">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. When you are gentle, you shall haue one too,<br>

And not till then<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07952"> Hor. That will not be in hast</p><br>

<p id="id07953">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Why sir I trust I may haue leaue to speake,<br>

And speake I will. I am no childe, no babe,<br>

Your betters haue indur'd me say my minde,<br>

And if you cannot, best you stop your eares.<br>

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,<br>

Or els my heart concealing it wil breake,<br>

And rather then it shall, I will be free,<br>

Euen to the vttermost as I please in words<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07954">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Why thou saist true, it is paltrie cap,<br>

A custard coffen, a bauble, a silken pie,<br>

I loue thee well in that thou lik'st it not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07955">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Loue me, or loue me not, I like the cap,<br>

And it I will haue, or I will haue none<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07956">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Thy gowne, why I: come Tailor let vs see't.<br>

Oh mercie God, what masking stuffe is heere?<br>

Whats this? a sleeue? 'tis like demi cannon,<br>

What, vp and downe caru'd like an apple Tart?<br>

Heers snip, and nip, and cut, and slish and slash,<br>

Like to a Censor in a barbers shoppe:<br>

Why what a deuils name Tailor cal'st thou this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. I see shees like to haue neither cap nor gowne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07957">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai. You bid me make it orderlie and well,<br>

According to the fashion, and the time<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07958">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Marrie and did: but if you be remembred,<br>

I did not bid you marre it to the time.<br>

Go hop me ouer euery kennell home,<br>

For you shall hop without my custome sir:<br>

Ile none of it; hence, make your best of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07959">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. I neuer saw a better fashion'd gowne,<br>

More queint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:<br>

Belike you meane to make a puppet of me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07960"> Pet. Why true, he meanes to make a puppet of thee</p><br>

<p id="id07961">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail. She saies your Worship meanes to make a<br>

puppet of her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07962">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Oh monstrous arrogance:<br>

Thou lyest, thou thred, thou thimble,<br>

Thou yard three quarters, halfe yard, quarter, naile,<br>

Thou Flea, thou Nit, thou winter cricket thou:<br>

Brau'd in mine owne house with a skeine of thred:<br>

Away thou Ragge, thou quantitie, thou remnant,<br>

Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard,<br>

As thou shalt thinke on prating whil'st thou liu'st:<br>

I tell thee I, that thou hast marr'd her gowne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07963">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail. Your worship is deceiu'd, the gowne is made<br>

Iust as my master had direction:<br>

Grumio gaue order how it should be done<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07964"> Gru. I gaue him no order, I gaue him the stuffe</p><br>

<p id="id07965">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail. But how did you desire it should be made?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Marrie sir with needle and thred<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07966">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail. But did you not request to haue it cut?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Thou hast fac'd many things<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07967"> Tail. I haue</p><br>

<p id="id07968"> Gru. Face not mee: thou hast brau'd manie men,
braue not me; I will neither bee fac'd nor brau'd. I say
vnto thee, I bid thy Master cut out the gowne, but I did
not bid him cut it to peeces. Ergo thou liest</p><br>

<p id="id07969"> Tail. Why heere is the note of the fashion to testify</p><br>

<p id="id07970"> Pet. Reade it</p><br>

<p id="id07971"> Gru. The note lies in's throate if he say I said so</p><br>

<p id="id07972"> Tail. Inprimis, a loose bodied gowne</p><br>

<p id="id07973"> Gru. Master, if euer I said loose-bodied gowne, sow
me in the skirts of it, and beate me to death with a bottome
of browne thred: I said a gowne</p><br>

<p id="id07974"> Pet. Proceede</p><br>

<p id="id07975"> Tai. With a small compast cape</p><br>

<p id="id07976"> Gru. I confesse the cape</p><br>

<p id="id07977"> Tai. With a trunke sleeue</p><br>

<p id="id07978"> Gru. I confesse two sleeues</p><br>

<p id="id07979"> Tai. The sleeues curiously cut</p><br>

<p id="id07980"> Pet. I there's the villanie</p><br>

<p id="id07981"> Gru. Error i'th bill sir, error i'th bill? I commanded
the sleeues should be cut out, and sow'd vp againe, and
that Ile proue vpon thee, though thy little finger be armed
in a thimble</p><br>

<p id="id07982">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail. This is true that I say, and I had thee in place<br>

where thou shouldst know it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07983">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. I am for thee straight: take thou the bill, giue<br>

me thy meat-yard, and spare not me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07984">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. God-a-mercie Grumio, then hee shall haue no<br>

oddes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07985"> Pet. Well sir in breefe the gowne is not for me</p><br>

<p id="id07986"> Gru. You are i'th right sir, 'tis for my mistris</p><br>

<p id="id07987"> Pet. Go take it vp vnto thy masters vse</p><br>

<p id="id07988">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Villaine, not for thy life: Take vp my Mistresse<br>

gowne for thy masters vse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07989">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Why sir, what's your conceit in that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru. Oh sir, the conceit is deeper then you think for:<br>

Take vp my Mistris gowne to his masters vse.<br>

Oh fie, fie, fie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07990">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Hortensio, say thou wilt see the Tailor paide:<br>

Go take it hence, be gone, and say no more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07991">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Tailor, Ile pay thee for thy gowne to morrow,<br>

Take no vnkindnesse of his hastie words:<br>

Away I say, commend me to thy master.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07992">Exit Tail.</p><br>

<p id="id07993">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Well, come my Kate, we will vnto your fathers,<br>

Euen in these honest meane habiliments:<br>

Our purses shall be proud, our garments poore:<br>

For 'tis the minde that makes the bodie rich.<br>

And as the Sunne breakes through the darkest clouds,<br>

So honor peereth in the meanest habit.<br>

What is the Iay more precious then the Larke?<br>

Because his feathers are more beautifull.<br>

Or is the Adder better then the Eele,<br>

Because his painted skin contents the eye.<br>

Oh no good Kate: neither art thou the worse<br>

For this poore furniture, and meane array.<br>

If thou accountedst it shame, lay it on me,<br>

And therefore frolicke, we will hence forthwith,<br>

To feast and sport vs at thy fathers house,<br>

Go call my men, and let vs straight to him,<br>

And bring our horses vnto Long-lane end,<br>

There wil we mount, and thither walke on foote,<br>

Let's see, I thinke 'tis now some seuen a clocke,<br>

And well we may come there by dinner time<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07994">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. I dare assure you sir, 'tis almost two,<br>

And 'twill be supper time ere you come there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07995">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. It shall be seuen ere I go to horse:<br>

Looke what I speake, or do, or thinke to doe,<br>

You are still crossing it, sirs let't alone,<br>

I will not goe to day, and ere I doe,<br>

It shall be what a clock I say it is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07996">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hor. Why so this gallant will command the sunne.<br>

Enter Tranio, and the Pedant drest like Vincentio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07997"> Tra. Sirs, this is the house, please it you that I call</p><br>

<p id="id07998">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ped. I what else, and but I be deceiued,<br>

Signior Baptista may remember me<br>

Neere twentie yeares a goe in Genoa<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id07999">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Where we were lodgers, at the Pegasus,<br>

Tis well, and hold your owne in any case<br>

With such austeritie as longeth to a father.<br>

Enter Biondello.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08000">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ped. I warrant you: but sir here comes your boy,<br>

'Twere good he were school'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08001">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Feare you not him: sirra Biondello,<br>

Now doe your dutie throughlie I aduise you:<br>

Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08002"> Bion. Tut, feare not me</p><br>

<p id="id08003"> Tra. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista</p><br>

<p id="id08004">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bion. I told him that your father was at Venice,<br>

And that you look't for him this day in Padua,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Th'art a tall fellow, hold thee that to drinke,<br>

Here comes Baptista: set your countenance sir.<br>

Enter Baptista and Lucentio: Pedant booted and bare headed.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08005">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Signior Baptista you are happilie met:<br>

Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of,<br>

I pray you stand good father to me now,<br>

Giue me Bianca for my patrimony<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08006">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ped. Soft son: sir by your leaue, hauing com to Padua<br>

To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio<br>

Made me acquainted with a waighty cause<br>

Of loue betweene your daughter and himselfe:<br>

And for the good report I heare of you,<br>

And for the loue he beareth to your daughter,<br>

And she to him: to stay him not too long,<br>

I am content in a good fathers care<br>

To haue him matcht, and if you please to like<br>

No worse then I, vpon some agreement<br>

Me shall you finde readie and willing<br>

With one consent to haue her so bestowed:<br>

For curious I cannot be with you<br>

Signior Baptista, of whom I heare so well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08007">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Sir, pardon me in what I haue to say,<br>

Your plainnesse and your shortnesse please me well:<br>

Right true it is your sonne Lucentio here<br>

Doth loue my daughter, and she loueth him,<br>

Or both dissemble deepely their affections:<br>

And therefore if you say no more then this,<br>

That like a Father you will deale with him,<br>

And passe my daughter a sufficient dower,<br>

The match is made, and all is done,<br>

Your sonne shall haue my daughter with consent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08008">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. I thanke you sir, where then doe you know best<br>

We be affied and such assurance tane,<br>

As shall with either parts agreement stand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08009">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. Not in my house Lucentio, for you know<br>

Pitchers haue eares, and I haue manie seruants,<br>

Besides old Gremio is harkning still,<br>

And happilie we might be interrupted<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08010">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. Then at my lodging, and it like you,<br>

There doth my father lie: and there this night<br>

Weele passe the businesse priuately and well:<br>

Send for your daughter by your seruant here,<br>

My Boy shall fetch the Scriuener presentlie,<br>

The worst is this that at so slender warning,<br>

You are like to haue a thin and slender pittance<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08011">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bap. It likes me well:<br>

Cambio hie you home, and bid Bianca make her readie<br>

straight:<br>

And if you will tell what hath hapned,<br>

Lucentios Father is arriued in Padua,<br>

And how she's like to be Lucentios wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08012">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biond. I praie the gods she may withall my heart.<br>

Enter.<br>

Enter Peter.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. Biondello, what of that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Biond. Faith nothing: but has left mee here behinde<br>

to expound the meaning or morrall of his signes and tokens<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08021"> Luc. I pray thee moralize them</p><br>

<p id="id08022">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biond. Then thus: Baptista is safe talking with the<br>

deceiuing Father of a deceitfull sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08023">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. And what of him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Biond. His daughter is to be brought by you to the<br>

counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her, Cum

Priest, Clarke, and some sufficient honest witnesses:
If this be not that you looke for, I haue no more to say,
But bid Bianca farewell for euer and a day</p><br>

Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the Moone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08033">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. The Moone, the Sunne: it is not Moonelight<br>

<p id="id08034"> Pet. I say it is the Moone that shines so bright</p><br>

<p id="id08035"> Kate. I know it is the Sunne that shines so bright</p><br>

This is a man old, wrinckled, faded, withered,<br>

And not a Maiden, as thou saist he is<br>

Vnto their losses twentie thousand crownes,<br>

Another dowrie to another daughter,<br>

For she is chang'd as she had neuer bin<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08191">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petr. Nay, I will win my wager better yet,<br>

And show more signe of her obedience,<br>

<p id="id08192">See where she comes, and brings your froward Wiues<br>

As prisoners to her womanlie perswasion:<br>

Katerine, that Cap of yours becomes you not,<br>

Off with that bable, throw it vnderfoote<br>

<p id="id08194">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bian. Fie what a foolish dutie call you this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. I would your dutie were as foolish too:<br>

telling<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08198"> Pet. Come on I say, and first begin with her</p><br>

<p id="id08199"> Wid. She shall not</p><br>

<p id="id08200"> Pet. I say she shall, and first begin with her</p><br>

<p id="id08201">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate. Fie, fie, vnknit that threatning vnkinde brow,<br>

And dart not scornefull glances from those eies,<br>

To wound thy Lord, thy King, thy Gouernour.<br>

It blots thy beautie, as frosts doe bite the Meads,<br>

Confounds thy fame, as whirlewinds shake faire budds,<br>

And in no sence is meete or amiable.<br>

A woman mou'd, is like a fountaine troubled,<br>

Muddie, ill seeming, thicke, bereft of beautie,<br>

And while it is so, none so dry or thirstie<br>

Will daigne to sip, or touch one drop of it.<br>

Thy husband is thy Lord, thy life, thy keeper,<br>

Thy head, thy soueraigne: One that cares for thee,<br>

And for thy maintenance. Commits his body<br>

To painfull labour, both by sea and land:<br>

To watch the night in stormes, the day in cold,<br>

Whil'st thou ly'st warme at home, secure and safe,<br>

And craues no other tribute at thy hands,<br>

But loue, faire lookes, and true obedience;<br>

Too little payment for so great a debt.<br>

Such dutie as the subiect owes the Prince,<br>

Euen such a woman oweth to her husband:<br>

And when she is froward, peeuish, sullen, sowre,<br>

And not obedient to his honest will,<br>

What is she but a foule contending Rebell,<br>

And gracelesse Traitor to her louing Lord?<br>

I am asham'd that women are so simple,<br>

To offer warre, where they should kneele for peace:<br>

Or seeke for rule, supremacie, and sway,<br>

When they are bound to serue, loue, and obay.<br>

Why are our bodies soft, and weake, and smooth,<br>

Vnapt to toyle and trouble in the world,<br>

But that our soft conditions, and our harts,<br>

Should well agree with our externall parts?<br>

Come, come, you froward and vnable wormes,<br>

My minde hath bin as bigge as one of yours,<br>

My heart as great, my reason haplie more,<br>

To bandie word for word, and frowne for frowne;<br>

But now I see our Launces are but strawes:<br>

Our strength as weake, our weakenesse past compare,<br>

That seeming to be most, which we indeed least are.<br>

Then vale your stomackes, for it is no boote,<br>

And place your hands below your husbands foote:<br>

In token of which dutie, if he please,<br>

My hand is readie, may it do him ease<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08202">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Why there's a wench: Come on, and kisse mee<br>

Kate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08203"> Luc. Well go thy waies olde Lad for thou shalt ha't</p><br>

<p id="id08204"> Vin. Tis a good hearing, when children are toward</p><br>

<p id="id08205">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luc. But a harsh hearing, when women are froward,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Come Kate, wee'le to bed,<br>

We three are married, but you two are sped.<br>

'Twas I wonne the wager, though you hit the white,<br>

And being a winner, God giue you good night.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08206">Exit Petruchio</p><br>

<p id="id08207">&nbsp;&nbsp;Horten. Now goe thy wayes, thou hast tam'd a curst<br>

Shrow<br>

<p id="id08211">Actus primus. Scoena Prima.</p><br>

<p id="id08212">Enter yong Bertram Count of Rossillion, his Mother, and Helena,<br>

Lord<br>

Lafew, all in blacke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08213">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother. In deliuering my sonne from me, I burie a second<br>

husband<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08214"> Ros. And I in going Madam, weep ore my
fathers death anew; but I must attend his maiesties
command, to whom I am now in Ward, euermore
in subiection</p><br>

<p id="id08215"> Laf. You shall find of the King a husband Madame,
you sir a father. He that so generally is at all times good,
must of necessitie hold his vertue to you, whose worthinesse
would stirre it vp where it wanted rather then lack
it where there is such abundance</p><br>

<p id="id08216"> Mo. What hope is there of his Maiesties amendment?
 Laf. He hath abandon'd his Phisitions Madam, vnder
whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope,
and finds no other aduantage in the processe, but onely
the loosing of hope by time</p><br>

<p id="id08217"> Mo. This yong Gentlewoman had a father, O that
had, how sad a passage tis, whose skill was almost as
great as his honestie, had it stretch'd so far, would haue
made nature immortall, and death should haue play for
lacke of worke. Would for the Kings sake hee were liuing,
I thinke it would be the death of the Kings disease</p><br>

<p id="id08218">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. How call'd you the man you speake of Madam?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo. He was famous sir in his profession, and it was<br>

his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08219"> Laf. He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very
latelie spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly: hee
was skilfull enough to haue liu'd stil, if knowledge could
be set vp against mortallitie</p><br>

<p id="id08220">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. What is it (my good Lord) the King languishes<br>

of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. A Fistula my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08221"> Ros. I heard not of it before</p><br>

<p id="id08222"> Laf. I would it were not notorious. Was this Gentlewoman
the Daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
 Mo. His sole childe my Lord, and bequeathed to my
ouer looking. I haue those hopes of her good, that her
education promises her dispositions shee inherits, which
makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind carries
vertuous qualities, there commendations go with
pitty, they are vertues and traitors too: in her they are
the better for their simplenesse; she deriues her honestie,
and atcheeues her goodnesse</p><br>

<p id="id08223" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Lafew. Your commendations Madam get from her
teares</p><br>

<p id="id08224"> Mo. 'Tis the best brine a Maiden can season her praise
in. The remembrance of her father neuer approches her
heart, but the tirrany of her sorrowes takes all liuelihood
from her cheeke. No more of this Helena, go too, no
more least it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, then
to haue-
 Hell. I doe affect a sorrow indeed, but I haue it too</p><br>

<p id="id08225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,<br>

excessiue greefe the enemie to the liuing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08226">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo. If the liuing be enemie to the greefe, the excesse<br>

makes it soone mortall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08227"> Ros. Maddam I desire your holie wishes</p><br>

<p id="id08228">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. How vnderstand we that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo. Be thou blest Bertrame, and succeed thy father<br>

In manners as in shape: thy blood and vertue<br>

Contend for Empire in thee, and thy goodnesse<br>

Share with thy birth-right. Loue all, trust a few,<br>

Doe wrong to none: be able for thine enemie<br>

Rather in power then vse: and keepe thy friend<br>

Vnder thy owne lifes key. Be checkt for silence,<br>

But neuer tax'd for speech. What heauen more wil,<br>

That thee may furnish, and my prayers plucke downe,<br>

Fall on thy head. Farwell my Lord,<br>

'Tis an vnseason'd Courtier, good my Lord<br>

Aduise him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. He cannot want the best<br>

That shall attend his loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08230"> Mo. Heauen blesse him: Farwell Bertram</p><br>

<p id="id08231"> Ro. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoghts
be seruants to you: be comfortable to my mother, your
Mistris, and make much of her</p><br>

<p id="id08232">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. Farewell prettie Lady, you must hold the credit<br>

of your father<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08233">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. O were that all, I thinke not on my father,<br>

And these great teares grace his remembrance more<br>

Then those I shed for him. What was he like?<br>

I haue forgott him. My imagination<br>

Carries no fauour in't but Bertrams.<br>

I am vndone, there is no liuing, none,<br>

If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one,<br>

That I should loue a bright particuler starre,<br>

And think to wed it, he is so aboue me<br>

In his bright radience and colaterall light,<br>

Must I be comforted, not in his sphere;<br>

Th' ambition in my loue thus plagues it selfe:<br>

The hind that would be mated by the Lion<br>

Must die for loue. 'Twas prettie, though a plague<br>

To see him euerie houre to sit and draw<br>

His arched browes, his hawking eie, his curles<br>

In our hearts table: heart too capeable<br>

Of euerie line and tricke of his sweet fauour.<br>

But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancie<br>

Must sanctifie his Reliques. Who comes heere?<br>

Enter Parrolles.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08234">One that goes with him: I loue him for his sake,<br>

And yet I know him a notorious Liar,<br>

Thinke him a great way foole, solie a coward,<br>

Yet these fixt euils sit so fit in him,<br>

That they take place, when Vertues steely bones<br>

Lookes bleake i'th cold wind: withall, full ofte we see<br>

Cold wisedome waighting on superfluous follie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08235"> Par. Saue you faire Queene</p><br>

<p id="id08236"> Hel. And you Monarch</p><br>

<p id="id08237"> Par. No</p><br>

<p id="id08238"> Hel. And no</p><br>

<p id="id08239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Are you meditating on virginitie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I: you haue some staine of souldier in you: Let<br>

mee aske you a question. Man is enemie to virginitie,<br>

how may we barracado it against him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Keepe him out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08240"> Hel. But he assailes, and our virginitie though valiant,
in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs some war-like
resistance</p><br>

<p id="id08241" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Par. There is none: Man setting downe before you,
will vndermine you, and blow you vp</p><br>

<p id="id08242"> Hel. Blesse our poore Virginity from vnderminers
and blowers vp. Is there no Military policy how Virgins
might blow vp men?
 Par. Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will
quicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe
againe, with the breach your selues made, you lose your
Citty. It is not politicke, in the Common-wealth of
Nature, to preserue virginity. Losse of Virginitie, is
rationall encrease, and there was neuer Virgin goe, till
virginitie was first lost. That you were made of, is mettall
to make Virgins. Virginitie, by beeing once lost,
may be ten times found: by being euer kept, it is euer
lost: 'tis too cold a companion: Away with't</p><br>

<p id="id08243" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Hel. I will stand for't a little, though therefore I die
a Virgin</p><br>

<p id="id08244"> Par. There's little can bee saide in't, 'tis against the
rule of Nature. To speake on the part of virginitie, is
to accuse your Mothers; which is most infallible disobedience.
He that hangs himselfe is a Virgin: Virginitie
murthers it selfe, and should be buried in highwayes
out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate Offendresse against
Nature. Virginitie breedes mites, much like a
Cheese, consumes it selfe to the very payring, and so
dies with feeding his owne stomacke. Besides, Virginitie
is peeuish, proud, ydle, made of selfe-loue, which
is the most inhibited sinne in the Cannon. Keepe it not,
you cannot choose but loose by't. Out with't: within
ten yeare it will make it selfe two, which is a goodly increase,
and the principall it selfe not much the worse.
Away with't</p><br>

<p id="id08245"> Hel. How might one do sir, to loose it to her owne
liking?
 Par. Let mee see. Marry ill, to like him that ne're
it likes. 'Tis a commodity wil lose the glosse with lying:
The longer kept, the lesse worth: Off with't while 'tis
vendible. Answer the time of request, Virginitie like
an olde Courtier, weares her cap out of fashion, richly
suted, but vnsuteable, iust like the brooch &amp; the tooth-pick,
which were not now: your Date is better in your
Pye and your Porredge, then in your cheeke: and your
virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French
wither'd peares, it lookes ill, it eates drily, marry 'tis a
wither'd peare: it was formerly better, marry yet 'tis a
wither'd peare: Will you any thing with it?
 Hel. Not my virginity yet:
There shall your Master haue a thousand loues,
A Mother, and a Mistresse, and a friend,
A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,
A guide, a Goddesse, and a Soueraigne,
A Counsellor, a Traitoresse, and a Deare:
His humble ambition, proud humility:
His iarring, concord: and his discord, dulcet:
His faith, his sweet disaster: with a world
Of pretty fond adoptious christendomes
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he:
I know not what he shall, God send him well,
The Courts a learning place, and he is one</p><br>

<p id="id08246">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. What one ifaith?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. That I wish well, 'tis pitty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08247">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. What's pitty?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. That wishing well had not a body in't,<br>

Which might be felt, that we the poorer borne,<br>

Whose baser starres do shut vs vp in wishes,<br>

Might with effects of them follow our friends,<br>

And shew what we alone must thinke, which neuer<br>

Returnes vs thankes.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. The warres hath so kept you vnder, that you<br>

must needes be borne vnder Mars<br>

<p id="id08254"> Par. When he was predominant</p><br>

<p id="id08255"> Hel. When he was retrograde I thinke rather</p><br>

<p id="id08256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Why thinke you so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. You go so much backward when you fight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08257"> Par. That's for aduantage</p><br>

<p id="id08258"> Hel. So is running away,
When feare proposes the safetie:
But the composition that your valour and feare makes
in you, is a vertue of a good wing, and I like the
weare well</p><br>

<p id="id08259"> Paroll. I am so full of businesses, I cannot answere
thee acutely: I will returne perfect Courtier, in the
which my instruction shall serue to naturalize thee, so
thou wilt be capeable of a Courtiers councell, and vnderstand
what aduice shall thrust vppon thee, else thou
diest in thine vnthankfulnes, and thine ignorance makes
thee away, farewell: When thou hast leysure, say thy
praiers: when thou hast none, remember thy Friends:
Get thee a good husband, and vse him as he vses thee:
So farewell</p><br>

Into the seruice of the time, and was<br>

Discipled of the brauest. He lasted long,<br>

But on vs both did haggish Age steale on,<br>

And wore vs out of act: It much repaires me<br>

To talke of your good father; in his youth<br>

He had the wit, which I can well obserue<br>

To day in our yong Lords: but they may iest<br>

Till their owne scorne returne to them vnnoted<br>

Ere they can hide their leuitie in honour:<br>

So like a Courtier, contempt nor bitternesse<br>

Were in his pride, or sharpnesse; if they were,<br>

His equall had awak'd them, and his honour<br>

Clocke to it selfe, knew the true minute when<br>

Exception bid him speake: and at this time<br>

His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him,<br>

He vs'd as creatures of another place,<br>

And bow'd his eminent top to their low rankes,<br>

Making them proud of his humilitie,<br>

In their poore praise he humbled: Such a man<br>

Might be a copie to these yonger times;<br>

To grow there and to beare: Let me not liue,<br>

This his good melancholly oft began<br>

On the Catastrophe and heele of pastime<br>

When it was out: Let me not liue (quoth hee)<br>

After my flame lackes oyle, to be the snuffe<br>

Of yonger spirits, whose apprehensiue senses<br>

All but new things disdaine; whose iudgements are<br>

Meere fathers of their garments: whose constancies<br>

drudge; he that comforts my wife, is the cherisher of
my flesh and blood; hee that cherishes my flesh and
blood, loues my flesh and blood; he that loues my flesh
and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my
friend: if men could be contented to be what they are,
there were no feare in marriage, for yong Charbon the
Puritan, and old Poysam the Papist, how somere their

make title to as much loue as shee findes, there is
more owing her then is paid, and more shall be paid
her then sheele demand</p><br>

<p id="id08312"> Stew. Madam, I was verie late more neere her then
I thinke shee wisht mee, alone shee was, and did
communicate to her selfe her owne words to her
owne eares, shee thought, I dare vowe for her, they
toucht not anie stranger sence, her matter was, shee
loued your Sonne; Fortune shee said was no goddesse,
that had put such difference betwixt their two
estates: Loue no god, that would not extend his might
onelie, where qualities were leuell, Queene of Virgins,
that would suffer her poore Knight surpris'd
without rescue in the first assault or ransome afterward:
This shee deliuer'd in the most bitter touch of
sorrow that ere I heard Virgin exclaime in, which I held
my dutie speedily to acquaint you withall, sithence in
the losse that may happen, it concernes you something
to know it</p><br>

If euer we are natures, these are ours, this thorne<br>

Doth to our Rose of youth rightlie belong<br>

Our bloud to vs, this to our blood is borne,<br>

It is the show, and seale of natures truth,<br>

Where loues strong passion is imprest in youth,<br>

By our remembrances of daies forgon,<br>

Such were our faults, or then we thought them none,<br>

Her eie is sicke on't, I obserue her now<br>

sed a mother<br>

Me thought you saw a serpent, what's in mother,<br>

That you start at it? I say I am your mother,<br>

And put you in the Catalogue of those<br>

That were enwombed mine, 'tis often seene<br>

Adoption striues with nature, and choise breedes<br>

A natiue slip to vs from forraine seedes:<br>

You nere opprest me with a mothers groane,<br>

(Gods mercie maiden) dos it curd thy blood<br>

To say I am thy mother? what's the matter,<br>

That this distempered messenger of wet?<br>

The manie colour'd Iris rounds thine eye? - Why, that you are my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. That I am not<br>

<p id="id08320"> Old.Cou. I say I am your Mother</p><br>

I am from humble, he from honored name:<br>

No note vpon my Parents, his all noble,<br>

My Master, my deere Lord he is, and I<br>

He must not be my brother<br>

So that my Lord your sonne were not my brother,<br>

Indeede my mother, or were you both our mothers,<br>

I care no more for, then I doe for heauen,<br>

So I were not his sister, cant no other,<br>

But I your daughter, he must be my brother<br>

<p id="id08324">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old.Cou. Yes Hellen, you might be my daughter in law,<br>

God shield you meane it not, daughter and mother<br>

So striue vpon your pulse; what pale agen?<br>

My feare hath catcht your fondnesse! now I see<br>

The mistrie of your louelinesse, and finde<br>

Your salt teares head, now to all sence 'tis grosse:<br>

You loue my sonne, inuention is asham'd<br>

Against the proclamation of thy passion<br>

To say thou doost not: therefore tell me true,<br>

But tell me then 'tis so, for looke, thy cheekes<br>

Confesse it 'ton tooth to th' other, and thine eies<br>

See it so grosely showne in thy behauiours,<br>

That in their kinde they speake it, onely sinne<br>

And hellish obstinacie tye thy tongue<br>

That truth should be suspected, speake, ist so?<br>

If it be so, you haue wound a goodly clewe:<br>

If it be not, forsweare't how ere I charge thee,<br>

As heauen shall worke in me for thine auaile<br>

To tell me truelie<br>

<p id="id08327">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou. Loue you my Sonne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. Doe not you loue him Madam?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou. Goe not about; my loue hath in't a bond<br>

Whereof the world takes note: Come, come, disclose:<br>

The state of your affection, for your passions<br>

Haue to the full appeach'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. Then I confesse<br>

Here on my knee, before high heauen and you,<br>

That before you, and next vnto high heauen, I loue your<br>

Sonne:<br>

My friends were poore but honest, so's my loue:<br>

Be not offended, for it hurts not him<br>

That he is lou'd of me; I follow him not<br>

By any token of presumptuous suite,<br>

Nor would I haue him, till I doe deserue him,<br>

Yet neuer know how that desert should be:<br>

I know I loue in vaine, striue against hope:<br>

Yet in this captious, and intemible Siue.<br>

I still poure in the waters of my loue<br>

And lacke not to loose still; thus Indian like<br>

Religious in mine error, I adore<br>

The Sunne that lookes vpon his worshipper,<br>

But knowes of him no more. My deerest Madam,<br>

Let not your hate incounter with my loue,<br>

For louing where you doe; but if your selfe,<br>

Whose aged honor cites a vertuous youth,<br>

Did euer, in so true a flame of liking,<br>

Wish chastly, and loue dearely, that your Dian<br>

Was both her selfe and loue, O then giue pittie<br>

To her whose state is such, that cannot choose<br>

But lend and giue where she is sure to loose;<br>

That seekes not to finde that, her search implies,<br>

But riddle like, liues sweetely where she dies<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id08330"> Cou. Wherefore? tell true</p><br>

<p id="id08331">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. I will tell truth, by grace it selfe I sweare:<br>

You know my Father left me some prescriptions<br>

Of rare and prou'd effects, such as his reading<br>

And manifest experience, had collected<br>

For generall soueraigntie: and that he wil'd me<br>

In heedefull'st reseruation to bestow them,<br>

As notes, whose faculties inclusiue were,<br>

More then they were in note: Amongst the rest,<br>

There is a remedie, approu'd, set downe,<br>

To cure the desperate languishings whereof<br>

The King is render'd lost<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08332">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou. This was your motiue for Paris, was it, speake?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. My Lord, your sonne, made me to think of this;<br>

Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,<br>

Had from the conuersation of my thoughts,<br>

Happily beene absent then<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou. But thinke you Hellen,<br>

If you should tender your supposed aide,<br>

He would receiue it? He and his Phisitions<br>

Are of a minde, he, that they cannot helpe him:<br>

They, that they cannot helpe, how shall they credit<br>

A poore vnlearned Virgin, when the Schooles<br>

Embowel'd of their doctrine, haue left off<br>

The danger to it selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08334">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. There's something in't<br>

More then my Fathers skill, which was the great'st<br>

Of his profession, that his good receipt,<br>

Shall for my legacie be sanctified<br>

Byth' luckiest stars in heauen, and would your honor<br>

But giue me leaue to trie successe, I'de venture<br>

The well lost life of mine, on his Graces cure,<br>

By such a day, an houre<br>

<p id="id08335">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou. Doo'st thou beleeue't?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. I Madam knowingly<br>

<p id="id08336">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou. Why Hellen thou shalt haue my leaue and loue,<br>

Meanes and attendants, and my louing greetings<br>

To those of mine in Court, Ile staie at home<br>

And praie Gods blessing into thy attempt:<br>

Begon to morrow, and be sure of this,<br>

What I can helpe thee to, thou shalt not misse.<br>

Yes but you will, my noble grapes, and if<br>

My royall foxe could reach them: I haue seen a medicine<br>

That's able to breath life into a stone,<br>

Quicken a rocke, and make you dance Canari<br>

With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch<br>

Is powerfull to arayse King Pippen, nay<br>

To giue great Charlemaine a pen in's hand<br>

In this my light deliuerance, I haue spoke<br>

With one, that in her sexe, her yeeres, profession,<br>

Wisedome and constancy, hath amaz'd mee more<br>

For that is her demand, and know her businesse?<br>

That done, laugh well at me<br>

Knowing him is enough: on's bed of death,<br>

Many receits he gaue me, chieflie one,<br>

Which as the dearest issue of his practice<br>

And of his olde experience, th' onlie darling,<br>

He bad me store vp, as a triple eye,<br>

Safer then mine owne two: more deare I haue so,<br>

And hearing your high Maiestie is toucht<br>

With that malignant cause, wherein the honour<br>

Of my deare fathers gift, stands cheefe in power,<br>

I come to tender it, and my appliance,<br>

With all bound humblenesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08384">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We thanke you maiden,<br>

But may not be so credulous of cure,<br>

When our most learned Doctors leaue vs, and<br>

The congregated Colledge haue concluded,<br>

That labouring Art can neuer ransome nature<br>

From her inaydible estate: I say we must not<br>

So staine our iudgement, or corrupt our hope,<br>

To prostitute our past-cure malladie<br>

To empericks, or to disseuer so<br>

Our great selfe and our credit, to esteeme<br>

A sencelesse helpe, when helpe past sence we deeme<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08385">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. My dutie then shall pay me for my paines:<br>

I will no more enforce mine office on you,<br>

Humbly intreating from your royall thoughts,<br>

A modest one to beare me backe againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08386">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I cannot giue thee lesse to be cal'd gratefull:<br>

Thou thoughtst to helpe me, and such thankes I giue,<br>

As one neere death to those that wish him liue:<br>

But what at full I know, thou knowst no part,<br>

I knowing all my perill, thou no Art<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08387">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. What I can doe, can doe no hurt to try,<br>

Since you set vp your rest 'gainst remedie:<br>

He that of greatest workes is finisher,<br>

Oft does them by the weakest minister:<br>

So holy Writ, in babes hath iudgement showne,<br>

When Iudges haue bin babes; great flouds haue flowne<br>

From simple sources: and great Seas haue dried<br>

When Miracles haue by the great'st beene denied.<br>

Oft expectation failes, and most oft there<br>

Where most it promises: and oft it hits,<br>

Where hope is coldest, and despaire most shifts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08388">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I must not heare thee, fare thee wel kind maide,<br>

Thy paines not vs'd, must by thy selfe be paid,<br>

Proffers not tooke, reape thanks for their reward<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08389">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Inspired Merit so by breath is bard,<br>

It is not so with him that all things knowes<br>

As 'tis with vs, that square our guesse by showes:<br>

But most it is presumption in vs, when<br>

The help of heauen we count the act of men.<br>

Deare sir, to my endeauors giue consent,<br>

Of heauen, not me, make an experiment.<br>

I am not an Imposture, that proclaime<br>

My selfe against the leuill of mine aime,<br>

But know I thinke, and thinke I know most sure,<br>

My Art is not past power, nor you past cure<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08390">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Art thou so confident? Within what space<br>

Hop'st thou my cure?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. The greatest grace lending grace,<br>

Ere twice the horses of the sunne shall bring<br>

Their fiery torcher his diurnall ring,<br>

Ere twice in murke and occidentall dampe<br>

Moist Hesperus hath quench'd her sleepy Lampe:<br>

Or foure and twenty times the Pylots glasse<br>

Hath told the theeuish minutes, how they passe:<br>

What is infirme, from your sound parts shall flie,<br>

Health shall liue free, and sickenesse freely dye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08391">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Vpon thy certainty and confidence,<br>

What dar'st thou venter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell. Taxe of impudence,<br>

A strumpets boldnesse, a divulged shame<br>

Traduc'd by odious ballads: my maidens name<br>

Seard otherwise, ne worse of worst extended<br>

With vildest torture, let my life be ended<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08392">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak<br>

His powerfull sound, within an organ weake:<br>

And what impossibility would slay<br>

In common sence, sence saues another way:<br>

Thy life is deere, for all that life can rate<br>

Worth name of life, in thee hath estimate:<br>

Youth, beauty, wisedome, courage, all<br>

That happines and prime, can happy call:<br>

Thou this to hazard, needs must intimate<br>

Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate,<br>

Sweet practiser, thy Physicke I will try,<br>

That ministers thine owne death if I die<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08393">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. If I breake time, or flinch in property<br>

Of what I spoke, vnpittied let me die,<br>

And well deseru'd: not helping, death's my fee,<br>

But if I helpe, what doe you promise me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08394"> Kin. Make thy demand</p><br>

<p id="id08395">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. But will you make it euen?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. I by my Scepter, and my hopes of helpe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08396">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Then shalt thou giue me with thy kingly hand<br>

What husband in thy power I will command:<br>

Exempted be from me the arrogance<br>

To choose from forth the royall bloud of France,<br>

My low and humble name to propagate<br>

With any branch or image of thy state:<br>

But such a one thy vassall, whom I know<br>

Is free for me to aske, thee to bestow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08397">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Heere is my hand, the premises obseru'd,<br>

Thy will by my performance shall be seru'd:<br>

So make the choice of thy owne time, for I<br>

Thy resolv'd Patient, on thee still relye:<br>

More should I question thee, and more I must,<br>

Though more to know, could not be more to trust:<br>

From whence thou cam'st, how tended on, but rest<br>

Vnquestion'd welcome, and vndoubted blest.<br>

Giue me some helpe heere hoa, if thou proceed,<br>

As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.<br>

 Clo. Truly Madam, if God haue lent a man any manners,
hee may easilie put it off at Court: hee that cannot
make a legge, put off's cap, kisse his hand, and say nothing,
has neither legge, hands, lippe, nor cap; and indeed
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
Court, but for me, I haue an answere will serue all men</p><br>

<p id="id08403" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Lady. Marry that's a bountifull answere that fits all
questions</p><br>

<p id="id08404"> Clo. It is like a Barbers chaire that fits all buttockes,
the pin buttocke, the quatch-buttocke, the brawn buttocke,
or any buttocke</p><br>

<p id="id08405"> Lady. Will your answere serue fit to all questions?
 Clo. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an Atturney,
as your French Crowne for your taffety punke, as
Tibs rush for Toms fore-finger, as a pancake for Shroue-tuesday,
a Morris for May-day, as the naile to his hole,
the Cuckold to his horne, as a scolding queane to a
wrangling knaue, as the Nuns lip to the Friers mouth,
nay as the pudding to his skin</p><br>

<p id="id08406">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Haue you, I say, an answere of such fitnesse for<br>

all questions?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. From below your Duke, to beneath your Constable,<br>

it will fit any question<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08407">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. It must be an answere of most monstrous size,<br>

that must fit all demands<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08408"> Clo. But a triflle neither in good faith, if the learned
should speake truth of it: heere it is, and all that belongs
to't. Aske mee if I am a Courtier, it shall doe you no
harme to learne</p><br>

<p id="id08409">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. To be young againe if we could: I will bee a<br>

foole in question, hoping to bee the wiser by your answer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08410">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. I pray you sir, are you a Courtier?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. O Lord sir theres a simple putting off: more,<br>

more, a hundred of them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08411"> La. Sir I am a poore freind of yours, that loues you</p><br>

<p id="id08412"> Clo. O Lord sir, thicke, thicke, spare not me</p><br>

<p id="id08413" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> La. I thinke sir, you can eate none of this homely
meate</p><br>

<p id="id08414"> Clo. O Lord sir; nay put me too't, I warrant you</p><br>

<p id="id08415"> La. You were lately whipt sir as I thinke</p><br>

<p id="id08416"> Clo. O Lord sir, spare not me</p><br>

<p id="id08417"> La. Doe you crie O Lord sir at your whipping, and
spare not me? Indeed your O Lord sir, is very sequent
to your whipping: you would answere very well to a
whipping if you were but bound too't</p><br>

<p id="id08418">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I nere had worse lucke in my life in my O Lord<br>

sir: I see things may serue long, but not serue euer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08419">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. I play the noble huswife with the time, to entertaine<br>

it so merrily with a foole<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08420"> Clo. O Lord sir, why there't serues well agen</p><br>

<p id="id08421">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. And end sir to your businesse: giue Hellen this,<br>

And vrge her to a present answer backe,<br>

Commend me to my kinsmen, and my sonne,<br>

This is not much<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08422"> Clo. Not much commendation to them</p><br>

<p id="id08423" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> La. Not much imployement for you, you vnderstand
me</p><br>

<p id="id08424"> Clo. Most fruitfully, I am there, before my legges</p><br>

<p id="id08425"> La. Hast you agen.</p><br>

<p id="id08426">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id08428"> Ol.Laf. They say miracles are past, and we haue our

<p id="id08474">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. My wife my Leige? I shal beseech your highnes<br>

In such a busines, giue me leaue to vse<br>

The helpe of mine owne eies<br>

<p id="id08475">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Know'st thou not Bertram what shee ha's<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Yes my good Lord, but neuer hope to know<br>

why I should marrie her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08476">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Thou know'st shee ha's rais'd me from my sickly<br>

<p id="id08477">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. But followes it my Lord, to bring me downe<br>

Must answer for your raising? I knowe her well:<br>

Shee had her breeding at my fathers charge:<br>

A poore Physitians daughter my wife? Disdaine<br>

Rather corrupt me euer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08478">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Tis onely title thou disdainst in her, the which<br>

I can build vp: strange is it that our bloods<br>

Of colour, waight, and heat, pour'd all together,<br>

Would quite confound distinction: yet stands off<br>

In differences so mightie. If she bee<br>

All that is vertuous (saue what thou dislik'st)<br>

A poore Phisitians daughter, thou dislik'st<br>

Of vertue for the name: but doe not so:<br>

From lowest place, whence vertuous things proceed,<br>

The place is dignified by th' doers deede.<br>

Where great additions swell's, and vertue none,<br>

It is a dropsied honour. Good alone,<br>

Is good without a name? Vilenesse is so:<br>

The propertie by what is is, should go,<br>

Not by the title. Shee is young, wise, faire,<br>

In these, to Nature shee's immediate heire:<br>

And these breed honour: that is honours scorne,<br>

Which challenges it selfe as honours borne,<br>

And is not like the sire: Honours thriue,<br>

When rather from our acts we them deriue<br>

Then our fore-goers: the meere words, a slaue<br>

Debosh'd on euerie tombe, on euerie graue:<br>

A lying Trophee, and as oft is dumbe,<br>

Where dust, and damn'd obliuion is the Tombe.<br>

Of honour'd bones indeed, what should be saide?<br>

If thou canst like this creature, as a maide,<br>

I can create the rest: Vertue, and shee<br>

Is her owne dower: Honour and wealth, from mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08479"> Ber. I cannot loue her, nor will striue to doo't</p><br>

<p id="id08480">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Thou wrong'st thy selfe, if thou shold'st striue<br>

to choose<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08481">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. That you are well restor'd my Lord, I'me glad:<br>

Let the rest go<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08482">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. My Honor's at the stake, which to defeate<br>

I must produce my power. Heere, take her hand,<br>

Proud scornfull boy, vnworthie this good gift,<br>

That dost in vile misprision shackle vp<br>

My loue, and her desert: that canst not dreame,<br>

We poizing vs in her defectiue scale,<br>

Shall weigh thee to the beame: That wilt not know,<br>

It is in Vs to plant thine Honour, where<br>

We please to haue it grow. Checke thy contempt:<br>

Obey Our will, which trauailes in thy good:<br>

Beleeue not thy disdaine, but presentlie<br>

Do thine owne fortunes that obedient right<br>

Which both thy dutie owes, and Our power claimes,<br>

Or I will throw thee from my care for euer<br>

Into the staggers, and the carelesse lapse<br>

Of youth and ignorance: both my reuenge and hate<br>

Loosing vpon thee, in the name of iustice,<br>

Without all termes of pittie. Speake, thine answer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08483">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Pardon my gracious Lord: for I submit<br>

My fancie to your eies, when I consider<br>

What great creation, and what dole of honour<br>

Flies where you bid it: I finde that she which late<br>

Was in my Nobler thoughts, most base: is now<br>

The praised of the King, who so ennobled,<br>

Is as 'twere borne so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08484">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Take her by the hand,<br>

And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise<br>

A counterpoize: If not to thy estate,<br>

A ballance more repleat<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08485"> Ber. I take her hand</p><br>

<p id="id08486">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Good fortune, and the fauour of the King<br>

Smile vpon this Contract: whose Ceremonie<br>

Shall seeme expedient on the now borne briefe,<br>

And be perform'd to night: the solemne Feast<br>

Shall more attend vpon the coming space,<br>

Expecting absent friends. As thou lou'st her,<br>

Thy loue's to me Religious: else, do's erre.<br>

she's very well, and wants nothing i'th world: but
yet she is not well</p><br>

I would she did as you say<br>

<p id="id08535"> Par. Why I say nothing</p><br>

<p id="id08536"> Clo. Marry you are the wiser man: for many a mans
tongue shakes out his masters vndoing: to say nothing,
to do nothing, to know nothing, and to haue nothing,
is to be a great part of your title, which is within a verie
little of nothing</p><br>

other Citizens.</p><br>

<p id="id08645">&nbsp;&nbsp;Widdow. Nay come,<br>

For if they do approach the Citty,<br>

We shall loose all the sight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08646">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana. They say, the French Count has done<br>

Most honourable seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08647">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. It is reported,<br>

That he has taken their great'st Commander,<br>

And that with his owne hand he slew<br>

The Dukes brother: we haue lost our labour,<br>

They are gone a contrarie way: harke,<br>

you may know by their Trumpets<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08648">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria. Come lets returne againe,<br>

And suffice our selues with the report of it.<br>

Well Diana, take heed of this French Earle,<br>

The honor of a Maide is her name,<br>

And no Legacie is so rich<br>

As honestie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08649">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Widdow. I haue told my neighbour<br>

How you haue beene solicited by a Gentleman<br>

His Companion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08650"> Maria. I know that knaue, hang him, one Parolles,
a filthy Officer he is in those suggestions for the young
Earle, beware of them Diana; their promises, entisements,
oathes, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are
not the things they go vnder: many a maide hath beene
seduced by them, and the miserie is example, that so
terrible shewes in the wracke of maiden-hood, cannot
for all that disswade succession, but that they are limed
with the twigges that threatens them. I hope I neede
not to aduise you further, but I hope your owne grace
will keepe you where you are, though there were no
further danger knowne, but the modestie which is so
lost</p><br>

<p id="id08651">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. You shall not neede to feare me.<br>

Enter Hellen.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08652">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. I hope so: looke here comes a pilgrim, I know<br>

she will lye at my house, thither they send one another,<br>

Ile question her. God saue you pilgrim, whether are<br>

bound?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. To S[aint]. Iaques la grand.<br>

Where do the Palmers lodge, I do beseech you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. At the S[aint]. Francis heere beside the Port<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08653"> Hel. Is this the way?</p><br>

<p id="id08654">A march afarre.</p><br>

<p id="id08655">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. I marrie ist. Harke you, they come this way:<br>

If you will tarrie holy Pilgrime<br>

But till the troopes come by,<br>

I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd,<br>

The rather for I thinke I know your hostesse<br>

As ample as my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08656">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Is it your selfe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. If you shall please so Pilgrime<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08657"> Hel. I thanke you, and will stay vpon your leisure</p><br>

<p id="id08658">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. You came I thinke from France?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I did so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08659">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. Heere you shall see a Countriman of yours<br>

That has done worthy seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08660">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. His name I pray you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. The Count Rossillion: know you such a one?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. But by the eare that heares most nobly of him:<br>

His face I know not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08661">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. What somere he is<br>

He's brauely taken heere. He stole from France<br>

As 'tis reported: for the King had married him<br>

Against his liking. Thinke you it is so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I surely meere the truth, I know his Lady<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08662">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. There is a Gentleman that serues the Count,<br>

Reports but coursely of her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08663">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. What's his name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. Monsieur Parrolles<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08664">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Oh I beleeue with him,<br>

In argument of praise, or to the worth<br>

Of the great Count himselfe, she is too meane<br>

To haue her name repeated, all her deseruing<br>

Is a reserued honestie, and that<br>

I haue not heard examin'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08665">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dian. Alas poore Ladie,<br>

'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife<br>

Of a detesting Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08666">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. I write good creature, wheresoere she is,<br>

Her hart waighes sadly: this yong maid might do her<br>

A shrewd turne if she pleas'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08667">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. How do you meane?<br>

May be the amorous Count solicites her<br>

In the vnlawfull purpose<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08668">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. He does indeede,<br>

And brokes with all that can in such a suite<br>

Corrupt the tender honour of a Maide:<br>

But she is arm'd for him, and keepes her guard<br>

In honestest defence.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08669">Drumme and Colours. Enter Count Rossillion, Parrolles, and the<br>

whole<br>

Armie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08670"> Mar. The goddes forbid else</p><br>

<p id="id08671">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. So, now they come:<br>

That is Anthonio the Dukes eldest sonne,<br>

That Escalus<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08672">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Which is the Frenchman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. Hee,<br>

That with the plume, 'tis a most gallant fellow,<br>

I would he lou'd his wife: if he were honester<br>

He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsom Gentleman<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I like him well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08673">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di. 'Tis pitty he is not honest: yonds that same knaue<br>

That leades him to these places: were I his Ladie,<br>

I would poison that vile Rascall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08674">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Which is he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. That Iacke-an-apes with scarfes. Why is hee<br>

melancholly?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Perchance he's hurt i'th battaile<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08675"> Par. Loose our drum? Well</p><br>

<p id="id08676" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Mar. He's shrewdly vext at something. Looke he
has spyed vs</p><br>

<p id="id08677"> Wid. Marrie hang you</p><br>

<p id="id08678">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. And your curtesie, for a ring-carrier.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08679">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. The troope is past: Come pilgrim, I wil bring<br>

you, Where you shall host: Of inioyn'd penitents<br>

There's foure or fiue, to great S[aint]. Iaques bound,<br>

Alreadie at my house<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08680">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. I humbly thanke you:<br>

Please it this Matron, and this gentle Maide<br>

To eate with vs to night, the charge and thanking<br>

Shall be for me, and to requite you further,<br>

I will bestow some precepts of this Virgin,<br>

Worthy the note<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08681"> Both. Wee'l take your offer kindly.</p><br>

<p id="id08682">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id08683">Enter Count Rossillion and the Frenchmen, as at first.</p><br>

<p id="id08684">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. Nay good my Lord put him too't: let him<br>

haue his way<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08685">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. If your Lordshippe finde him not a Hilding,<br>

hold me no more in your respect<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08686"> Cap.E. On my life my Lord, a bubble</p><br>

<p id="id08687">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Do you thinke I am so farre<br>

Deceiued in him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08688"> Cap.E. Beleeue it my Lord, in mine owne direct
knowledge, without any malice, but to speake of him
as my kinsman, hee's a most notable Coward, an infinite
and endlesse Lyar, an hourely promise-breaker, the
owner of no one good qualitie, worthy your Lordships
entertainment</p><br>

<p id="id08689"> Cap.G. It were fit you knew him, least reposing too
farre in his vertue which he hath not, he might at some
great and trustie businesse, in a maine daunger, fayle
you</p><br>

<p id="id08690" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ber. I would I knew in what particular action to try
him</p><br>

<p id="id08691"> Cap.G. None better then to let him fetch off his
drumme, which you heare him so confidently vndertake
to do</p><br>

<p id="id08692"> C.E. I with a troop of Florentines wil sodainly surprize
him; such I will haue whom I am sure he knowes
not from the enemie: wee will binde and hoodwinke
him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried
into the Leager of the aduersaries, when we bring
him to our owne tents: be but your Lordship present
at his examination, if he do not for the promise of his
life, and in the highest compulsion of base feare, offer to
betray you, and deliuer all the intelligence in his power
against you, and that with the diuine forfeite of his
soule vpon oath, neuer trust my iudgement in anie
thing</p><br>

<p id="id08693"> Cap.G. O for the loue of laughter, let him fetch his
drumme, he sayes he has a stratagem for't: when your
Lordship sees the bottome of this successe in't, and to
what mettle this counterfeyt lump of ours will be melted
if you giue him not Iohn drummes entertainement,
your inclining cannot be remoued. Heere he comes.
Enter Parrolles.</p><br>

<p id="id08694"> Cap.E. O for the loue of laughter hinder not the honor
of his designe, let him fetch off his drumme in any
hand</p><br>

<p id="id08695" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ber. How now Monsieur? This drumme sticks sorely
in your disposition</p><br>

<p id="id08696"> Cap.G. A pox on't, let it go, 'tis but a drumme</p><br>

<p id="id08697"> Par. But a drumme: Ist but a drumme? A drum so
lost. There was excellent command, to charge in with
our horse vpon our owne wings, and to rend our owne
souldiers</p><br>

<p id="id08698"> Cap.G. That was not to be blam'd in the command
of the seruice: it was a disaster of warre that C??sar him
selfe could not haue preuented, if he had beene there to
command</p><br>

<p id="id08699"> Ber. Well, wee cannot greatly condemne our successe:
some dishonor wee had in the losse of that drum,
but it is not to be recouered</p><br>

<p id="id08700"> Par. It might haue beene recouered</p><br>

<p id="id08701"> Ber. It might, but it is not now</p><br>

<p id="id08702"> Par. It is to be recouered, but that the merit of seruice
is sildome attributed to the true and exact performer,
I would haue that drumme or another, or hic iacet</p><br>

<p id="id08703"> Ber. Why if you haue a stomacke, too't Monsieur: if
you thinke your mysterie in stratagem, can bring this
instrument of honour againe into his natiue quarter, be
magnanimious in the enterprize and go on, I wil grace
the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speede well in
it, the Duke shall both speake of it, and extend to you
what further becomes his greatnesse, euen to the vtmost
syllable of your worthinesse</p><br>

<p id="id08704"> Par. By the hand of a souldier I will vndertake it</p><br>

<p id="id08705"> Ber. But you must not now slumber in it</p><br>

<p id="id08706"> Par. Ile about it this euening, and I will presently
pen downe my dilemma's, encourage my selfe in my
certaintie, put my selfe into my mortall preparation:
and by midnight looke to heare further from me</p><br>

<p id="id08707">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. May I bee bold to acquaint his grace you are<br>

gone about it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08708">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. I know not what the successe wil be my Lord,<br>

but the attempt I vow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08709">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. I know th'art valiant,<br>

And to the possibility of thy souldiership,<br>

Will subscribe for thee: Farewell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08710"> Par. I loue not many words.</p><br>

<p id="id08711">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id08712"> Cap.E. No more then a fish loues water. Is not this
a strange fellow my Lord, that so confidently seemes to
vndertake this businesse, which he knowes is not to be
done, damnes himselfe to do, &amp; dares better be damnd
then to doo't</p><br>

<p id="id08713"> Cap.G. You do not know him my Lord as we doe,
certaine it is that he will steale himselfe into a mans fauour,
and for a weeke escape a great deale of discoueries,
but when you finde him out, you haue him euer after</p><br>

<p id="id08714"> Ber. Why do you thinke he will make no deede at
all of this that so seriouslie hee dooes addresse himselfe
vnto?
 Cap.E. None in the world, but returne with an inuention,
and clap vpon you two or three probable lies:
but we haue almost imbost him, you shall see his fall to
night; for indeede he is not for your Lordshippes respect</p><br>

<p id="id08715"> Cap.G. Weele make you some sport with the Foxe
ere we case him. He was first smoak'd by the old Lord
Lafew, when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what
a sprat you shall finde him, which you shall see this verie
night</p><br>

<p id="id08716">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. I must go looke my twigges,<br>

He shall be caught<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08717"> Ber. Your brother he shall go along with me</p><br>

<p id="id08718"> Cap.G. As't please your Lordship, Ile leaue you</p><br>

<p id="id08719">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Now wil I lead you to the house, and shew you<br>

The Lasse I spoke of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08720"> Cap.E. But you say she's honest</p><br>

<p id="id08721">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. That's all the fault: I spoke with hir but once,<br>

And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her<br>

By this same Coxcombe that we haue i'th winde<br>

Tokens and Letters, which she did resend,<br>

And this is all I haue done: She's a faire creature,<br>

Will you go see her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. With all my heart my Lord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08722">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id08723">Enter Hellen, and Widdow.</p><br>

<p id="id08724">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. If you misdoubt me that I am not shee,<br>

I know not how I shall assure you further,<br>

But I shall loose the grounds I worke vpon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08725">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. Though my estate be falne, I was well borne,<br>

Nothing acquainted with these businesses,<br>

And would not put my reputation now<br>

In any staining act<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08726">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Nor would I wish you.<br>

First giue me trust, the Count he is my husband,<br>

And what to your sworne counsaile I haue spoken,<br>

Is so from word to word: and then you cannot<br>

By the good ayde that I of you shall borrow,<br>

Erre in bestowing it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08727">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. I should beleeue you,<br>

For you haue shew'd me that which well approues<br>

Y'are great in fortune<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08728">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Take this purse of Gold,<br>

And let me buy your friendly helpe thus farre,<br>

Which I will ouer-pay, and pay againe<br>

When I haue found it. The Count he woes your<br>

daughter,<br>

Layes downe his wanton siedge before her beautie,<br>

Resolue to carrie her: let her in fine consent<br>

As wee'l direct her how 'tis best to beare it:<br>

Now his important blood will naught denie,<br>

That shee'l demand: a ring the Countie weares,<br>

That downward hath succeeded in his house<br>

From sonne to sonne, some foure or fiue discents,<br>

Since the first father wore it. This Ring he holds<br>

In most rich choice: yet in his idle fire,<br>

To buy his will, it would not seeme too deere,<br>

How ere repented after<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08729"> Wid. Now I see the bottome of your purpose</p><br>

<p id="id08730">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. You see it lawfull then, it is no more,<br>

But that your daughter ere she seemes as wonne,<br>

Desires this Ring; appoints him an encounter;<br>

In fine, deliuers me to fill the time,<br>

Her selfe most chastly absent: after<br>

To marry her, Ile adde three thousand Crownes<br>

To what is past already<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08731">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid. I haue yeelded:<br>

Instruct my daughter how she shall perseuer,<br>

That time and place with this deceite so lawfull<br>

May proue coherent. Euery night he comes<br>

With Musickes of all sorts, and songs compos'd<br>

To her vnworthinesse: It nothing steeds vs<br>

To chide him from our eeues, for he persists<br>

As if his life lay on't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08732">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Why then to night<br>

Let vs assay our plot, which if it speed,<br>

Is wicked meaning in a lawfull deede;<br>

And lawfull meaning in a lawfull act,<br>

Where both not sinne, and yet a sinfull fact.<br>

But let's about it.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08733">Actus Quartus.</p><br>

<p id="id08734">Enter one of the Frenchmen, with fiue or sixe other souldiers in
ambush.</p><br>

<p id="id08735"> Lord E. He can come no other way but by this hedge
corner: when you sallie vpon him, speake what terrible
Language you will: though you vnderstand it not your
selues, no matter: for we must not seeme to vnderstand
him, vnlesse some one among vs, whom wee must produce
for an Interpreter</p><br>

<p id="id08736"> 1.Sol. Good Captaine, let me be th' Interpreter</p><br>

<p id="id08737">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor.E. Art not acquainted with him? knowes he not<br>

thy voice?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Sol. No sir I warrant you<br>

<p id="id08738">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo.E. But what linsie wolsy hast thou to speake to vs<br>

againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08739"> 1.Sol. E'n such as you speake to me</p><br>

<p id="id08740"> Lo.E. He must thinke vs some band of strangers, i'th
aduersaries entertainment. Now he hath a smacke of all
neighbouring Languages: therefore we must euery one
be a man of his owne fancie, not to know what we speak
one to another: so we seeme to know, is to know straight
our purpose: Choughs language, gabble enough, and
good enough. As for you interpreter, you must seeme
very politicke. But couch hoa, heere hee comes, to beguile
two houres in a sleepe, and then to returne &amp; swear
the lies he forges.
Enter Parrolles.</p><br>

<p id="id08741"> Par. Ten a clocke: Within these three houres 'twill
be time enough to goe home. What shall I say I haue
done? It must bee a very plausiue inuention that carries
it. They beginne to smoake mee, and disgraces haue of
late, knock'd too often at my doore: I finde my tongue
is too foole-hardie, but my heart hath the feare of Mars
before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of
my tongue</p><br>

<p id="id08742" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Lo.E. This is the first truth that ere thine own tongue
was guiltie of</p><br>

<p id="id08743"> Par. What the diuell should moue mee to vndertake
the recouerie of this drumme, being not ignorant of the
impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
must giue my selfe some hurts, and say I got them in exploit:
yet slight ones will not carrie it. They will say,
came you off with so little? And great ones I dare not
giue, wherefore what's the instance. Tongue, I must put
you into a Butter-womans mouth, and buy my selfe another
of Baiazeths Mule, if you prattle mee into these
perilles</p><br>

<p id="id08744">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo.E. Is it possible he should know what hee is, and<br>

be that he is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08745">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. I would the cutting of my garments wold serue<br>

the turne, or the breaking of my Spanish sword<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Thirty fadome<br>

<p id="id08780"> Ber. They told me that your name was Fontybell</p><br>

<p id="id08781"> Dia. No my good Lord, Diana</p><br>

<p id="id08782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Titled Goddesse,<br>

And worth it with addition: but faire soule,<br>

In your fine frame hath loue no qualitie?<br>

If the quicke fire of youth light not your minde,<br>

You are no Maiden but a monument<br>

When you are dead you should be such a one<br>

As you are now: for you are cold and sterne,<br>

And now you should be as your mother was<br>

When your sweet selfe was got<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08783"> Dia. She then was honest</p><br>

<p id="id08784"> Ber. So should you be</p><br>

<p id="id08785">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. No:<br>

My mother did but dutie, such (my Lord)<br>

As you owe to your wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08786">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. No more a'that:<br>

I prethee do not striue against my vowes:<br>

I was compell'd to her, but I loue thee<br>

By loues owne sweet constraint, and will for euer<br>

Do thee all rights of seruice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08787">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. I so you serue vs<br>

Till we serue you: But when you haue our Roses,<br>

You barely leaue our thornes to pricke our selues,<br>

And mocke vs with our barenesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08788"> Ber. How haue I sworne</p><br>

<p id="id08789">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. Tis not the many oathes that makes the truth,<br>

But the plaine single vow, that is vow'd true:<br>

What is not holie, that we sweare not by,<br>

But take the high'st to witnesse: then pray you tell me,<br>

If I should sweare by Ioues great attributes,<br>

I lou'd you deerely, would you beleeue my oathes,<br>

When I did loue you ill? This ha's no holding<br>

To sweare by him whom I protest to loue<br>

That I will worke against him. Therefore your oathes<br>

Are words and poore conditions, but vnseal'd<br>

At lest in my opinion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08790">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Change it, change it:<br>

Be not so holy cruell: Loue is holie,<br>

And my integritie ne're knew the crafts<br>

That you do charge men with: Stand no more off,<br>

But giue thy selfe vnto my sicke desires,<br>

Who then recouers. Say thou art mine, and euer<br>

My loue as it beginnes, shall so perseuer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08791">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. I see that men make rope's in such a scarre,<br>

That wee'l forsake our selues. Giue me that Ring<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08792">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Ile lend it thee my deere; but haue no power<br>

To giue it from me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08793">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. Will you not my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. It is an honour longing to our house,<br>

Bequeathed downe from manie Ancestors,<br>

Which were the greatest obloquie i'th world,<br>

In me to loose<br>

My chastities the Iewell of our house,<br>

Bequeathed downe from many Ancestors,<br>

Which were the greatest obloquie i'th world,<br>

Brings in the Champion honor on my part,<br>

Against your vaine assault<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08795">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Heere, take my Ring,<br>

My house, mine honor, yea my life be thine,<br>

And Ile be bid by thee<br>

Ile order take, my mother shall not heare.<br>

Now will I charge you in the band of truth,<br>

When you haue conquer'd my yet maiden-bed,<br>

Remaine there but an houre, nor speake to mee:<br>

My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them,<br>

When backe againe this Ring shall be deliuer'd:<br>

And on your finger in the night, Ile put<br>

Another Ring, that what in time proceeds,<br>

May token to the future, our past deeds.<br>

Adieu till then, then faile not: you haue wonne<br>

A wife of me, though there my hope be done<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08797"> Ber. A heauen on earth I haue won by wooing thee</p><br>

<p id="id08798">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di. For which, liue long to thank both heauen &amp; me,<br>

You may so in the end.<br>

My mother told me iust how he would woo,<br>

As if she sate in's heart. She sayes, all men<br>

Haue the like oathes: He had sworne to marrie me<br>

When his wife's dead: therfore Ile lye with him<br>

When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braide,<br>

Marry that will, I liue and die a Maid:<br>

Onely in this disguise, I think't no sinne,<br>

To cosen him that would vniustly winne.<br>

<p id="id08801"> Cap.G. You haue not giuen him his mothers letter</p><br>

<p id="id08802"> Cap.E. I haue deliu'red it an houre since, there is som
thing in't that stings his nature: for on the reading it,
he chang'd almost into another man</p><br>

<p id="id08803" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cap.G. He has much worthy blame laid vpon him,
for shaking off so good a wife, and so sweet a Lady</p><br>

<p id="id08804"> Cap.E. Especially, hee hath incurred the euerlasting
displeasure of the King, who had euen tun'd his bounty
to sing happinesse to him. I will tell you a thing, but
you shall let it dwell darkly with you</p><br>

<p id="id08805" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cap.G. When you haue spoken it 'tis dead, and I am
the graue of it</p><br>

<p id="id08806"> Cap.E. Hee hath peruerted a young Gentlewoman
heere in Florence, of a most chaste renown, &amp; this night
he fleshes his will in the spoyle of her honour: hee hath
giuen her his monumentall Ring, and thinkes himselfe
made in the vnchaste composition</p><br>

<p id="id08807" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cap.G. Now God delay our rebellion as we are our
selues, what things are we</p><br>

<p id="id08808"> Cap.E. Meerely our owne traitours. And as in the
common course of all treasons, we still see them reueale
themselues, till they attaine to their abhorr'd ends: so
he that in this action contriues against his owne Nobility
in his proper streame, ore-flowes himselfe</p><br>

<p id="id08809"> Cap.G. Is it not meant damnable in vs, to be Trumpeters
of our vnlawfull intents? We shall not then haue
his company to night?
 Cap.E. Not till after midnight: for hee is dieted to
his houre</p><br>

<p id="id08810"> Cap.G. That approaches apace: I would gladly haue
him see his company anathomiz'd, that hee might take
a measure of his owne iudgements, wherein so curiously
he had set this counterfeit</p><br>

<p id="id08811">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. We will not meddle with him till he come;<br>

for his presence must be the whip of the other<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. In the meane time, what heare you of these<br>

Warres?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. I heare there is an ouerture of peace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08813"> Cap.G. Nay, I assure you a peace concluded</p><br>

<p id="id08814">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. What will Count Rossillion do then? Will he<br>

trauaile higher, or returne againe into France?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. I perceiue by this demand, you are not altogether<br>

of his councell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08815">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. Let it be forbid sir, so should I bee a great<br>

deale of his act<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08816"> Cap.G. Sir, his wife some two months since fledde
from his house, her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Iaques
le grand; which holy vndertaking, with most austere
sanctimonie she accomplisht: and there residing,
the tendernesse of her Nature, became as a prey to her
greefe: in fine, made a groane of her last breath, &amp; now
she sings in heauen</p><br>

<p id="id08817"> Cap.E. How is this iustified?
 Cap.G. The stronger part of it by her owne Letters,
which makes her storie true, euen to the poynt of her
death: her death it selfe, which could not be her office
to say, is come: was faithfully confirm'd by the Rector
of the place</p><br>

<p id="id08818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. Hath the Count all this intelligence?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. I, and the particular confirmations, point<br>

from point, to the full arming of the veritie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08819">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. I am heartily sorrie that hee'l bee gladde of<br>

this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08820">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. How mightily sometimes, we make vs comforts<br>

of our losses<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08821"> Cap.E. And how mightily some other times, wee
drowne our gaine in teares, the great dignitie that his
valour hath here acquir'd for him, shall at home be encountred
with a shame as ample</p><br>

<p id="id08822"> Cap.G. The webbe of our life, is of a mingled yarne,
good and ill together: our vertues would bee proud, if
our faults whipt them not, and our crimes would dispaire
if they were not cherish'd by our vertues.
Enter a Messenger.</p><br>

<p id="id08823">How now? Where's your master?
 Ser. He met the Duke in the street sir, of whom hee
hath taken a solemne leaue: his Lordshippe will next
morning for France. The Duke hath offered him Letters
of commendations to the King</p><br>

<p id="id08824"> Cap.E. They shall bee no more then needfull there,
if they were more then they can commend.
Enter Count Rossillion.</p><br>

<p id="id08825"> Ber. They cannot be too sweete for the Kings tartnesse,
heere's his Lordship now. How now my Lord,
i'st not after midnight?
 Ber. I haue to night dispatch'd sixteene businesses, a
moneths length a peece, by an abstract of successe: I
haue congied with the Duke, done my adieu with his
neerest; buried a wife, mourn'd for her, writ to my Ladie
mother, I am returning, entertain'd my Conuoy, &amp;
betweene these maine parcels of dispatch, affected many
nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I haue
not ended yet</p><br>

<p id="id08826"> Cap.E. If the businesse bee of any difficulty, and this
morning your departure hence, it requires hast of your
Lordship</p><br>

<p id="id08827"> Ber. I meane the businesse is not ended, as fearing
to heare of it hereafter: but shall we haue this dialogue
betweene the Foole and the Soldiour. Come, bring
forth this counterfet module, ha's deceiu'd mee, like a
double-meaning Prophesier</p><br>

<p id="id08828" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cap.E. Bring him forth, ha's sate i'th stockes all night
poore gallant knaue</p><br>

<p id="id08829"> Ber. No matter, his heeles haue deseru'd it, in vsurping
his spurres so long. How does he carry himselfe?
 Cap.E. I haue told your Lordship alreadie: The
stockes carrie him. But to answer you as you would be
vnderstood, hee weepes like a wench that had shed her
milke, he hath confest himselfe to Morgan, whom hee
supposes to be a Friar, fro[m] the time of his remembrance
to this very instant disaster of his setting i'th stockes:
and what thinke you he hath confest?
 Ber. Nothing of me, ha's a?
 Cap.E. His confession is taken, and it shall bee read
to his face, if your Lordshippe be in't, as I beleeue you
are, you must haue the patience to heare it.
Enter Parolles with his Interpreter.</p><br>

<p id="id08833">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. I will confesse what I know without constraint,<br>

<p id="id08837"> Par. And truly, as I hope to liue</p><br>

<p id="id08838"> Int. First demand of him, how many horse the Duke
is strong. What say you to that?
 Par. Fiue or sixe thousand, but very weake and vnseruiceable:
the troopes are all scattered, and the Commanders
verie poore rogues, vpon my reputation and
credit, and as I hope to liue</p><br>

<p id="id08839">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Int. Shall I set downe your answer so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Do, Ile take the Sacrament on't, how &amp; which<br>

way you will: all's one to him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08840"> Ber. What a past-sauing slaue is this?
 Cap.G. Y'are deceiu'd my Lord, this is Mounsieur
Parrolles the gallant militarist, that was his owne phrase
that had the whole theoricke of warre in the knot of his
scarfe, and the practise in the chape of his dagger</p><br>

<p id="id08841"> Cap.E. I will neuer trust a man againe, for keeping
his sword cleane, nor beleeue he can haue euerie thing
in him, by wearing his apparrell neatly</p><br>

<p id="id08842"> Int. Well, that's set downe</p><br>

<p id="id08843" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Par. Fiue or six thousand horse I sed, I will say true,
or thereabouts set downe, for Ile speake truth</p><br>

<p id="id08844"> Cap.G. He's very neere the truth in this</p><br>

<p id="id08845" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ber. But I con him no thankes for't in the nature he
deliuers it</p><br>

<p id="id08846"> Par. Poore rogues, I pray you say</p><br>

<p id="id08847"> Int. Well, that's set downe</p><br>

<p id="id08848">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. I humbly thanke you sir, a truth's a truth, the<br>

Rogues are maruailous poore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08849"> Interp. Demaund of him of what strength they are a
foot. What say you to that?
 Par. By my troth sir, if I were to liue this present
houre, I will tell true. Let me see, Spurio a hundred &amp;
fiftie, Sebastian so many, Corambus so many, Iaques so
many: Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowicke, and Gratij, two hundred
fiftie each: Mine owne Company, Chitopher, Vaumond,
Bentij, two hundred fiftie each: so that the muster
file, rotten and sound, vppon my life amounts not to fifteene
thousand pole, halfe of the which, dare not shake
the snow from off their Cassockes, least they shake themselues
to peeces</p><br>

<p id="id08850">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. What shall be done to him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. Nothing, but let him haue thankes. Demand<br>

of him my condition: and what credite I haue with the<br>

Duke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08851"> Int. Well that's set downe: you shall demaund of
him, whether one Captaine Dumaine bee i'th Campe, a
Frenchman: what his reputation is with the Duke, what
his valour, honestie, and expertnesse in warres: or whether
he thinkes it were not possible with well-waighing
summes of gold to corrupt him to a reuolt. What say you
to this? What do you know of it?
 Par. I beseech you let me answer to the particular of
the intergatories. Demand them singly</p><br>

<p id="id08852"> Int. Do you know this Captaine Dumaine?
 Par. I know him, a was a Botchers Prentize in Paris,
from whence he was whipt for getting the Shrieues fool
with childe, a dumbe innocent that could not say him
nay</p><br>

<p id="id08853">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Nay, by your leaue hold your hands, though I<br>

know his braines are forfeite to the next tile that fals<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08854">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Int. Well, is this Captaine in the Duke of Florences<br>

campe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Vpon my knowledge he is, and lowsie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08855">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.G. Nay looke not so vpon me: we shall heare of<br>

your Lord anon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08856">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Int. What is his reputation with the Duke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. The Duke knowes him for no other, but a poore<br>

Officer of mine, and writ to mee this other day, to turne<br>

him out a'th band. I thinke I haue his Letter in my pocket<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08857"> Int. Marry we'll search</p><br>

<p id="id08858"> Par. In good sadnesse I do not know, either it is there,
or it is vpon a file with the Dukes other Letters, in my
Tent</p><br>

<p id="id08859">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Int. Heere 'tis, heere's a paper, shall I reade it to you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. I do not know if it be it or no<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08860"> Ber. Our Interpreter do's it well</p><br>

<p id="id08861"> Cap.G. Excellently</p><br>

<p id="id08862"> Int. Dian, the Counts a foole, and full of gold</p><br>

<p id="id08863"> Par. That is not the Dukes letter sir: that is an aduertisement
to a proper maide in Florence, one Diana, to
take heede of the allurement of one Count Rossillion, a
foolish idle boy: but for all that very ruttish. I pray you
sir put it vp againe</p><br>

<p id="id08864"> Int. Nay, Ile reade it first by your fauour</p><br>

<p id="id08865"> Par. My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the
behalfe of the maid: for I knew the young Count to be a
dangerous and lasciuious boy, who is a whale to Virginity,
and deuours vp all the fry it finds</p><br>

<p id="id08866"> Ber. Damnable both-sides rogue</p><br>

<p id="id08869">When he sweares oathes, bid him drop gold, and<br>

take it:<br>

After he scores, he neuer payes the score:<br>

Halfe won is match well made, match and well make it,<br>

He nere payes after-debts, take it before,<br>

And say a souldier (Dian) told thee this:<br>

Men are to mell with, boyes are not to kis.<br>

For count of this, the Counts a Foole I know it,<br>

Who payes before, but not when he does owe it.<br>

Thine as he vow'd to thee in thine eare,<br>

<p id="id08871">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cap.E. This is your deuoted friend sir, the manifold<br>

Linguist, and the army-potent souldier<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08872">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. I could endure any thing before but a Cat, and<br>

now he's a Cat to me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08873">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Int. I perceiue sir by your Generals lookes, wee shall<br>

be faine to hang you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08874"> Par. My life sir in any case: Not that I am afraide to
dye, but that my offences beeing many, I would repent
out the remainder of Nature. Let me liue sir in a dungeon,
i'th stockes, or any where, so I may liue</p><br>

<p id="id08875"> Int. Wee'le see what may bee done, so you confesse
freely: therefore once more to this Captaine Dumaine:
you haue answer'd to his reputation with the Duke, and
to his valour. What is his honestie?
 Par. He will steale sir an Egge out of a Cloister: for
rapes and rauishments he paralels Nessus. Hee professes
not keeping of oaths, in breaking em he is stronger then
Hercules. He will lye sir, with such volubilitie, that you
would thinke truth were a foole: drunkennesse is his best
vertue, for he will be swine-drunke, and in his sleepe he
does little harme, saue to his bed-cloathes about him:
but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I
haue but little more to say sir of his honesty, he ha's euerie
thing that an honest man should not haue; what an
honest man should haue, he has nothing</p><br>

<p id="id08876"> Cap.G. I begin to loue him for this</p><br>

<p id="id08877" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ber. For this description of thine honestie? A pox
vpon him for me, he's more and more a Cat</p><br>

<p id="id08878"> Int. What say you to his expertnesse in warre?
 Par. Faith sir, ha's led the drumme before the English
Tragedians: to belye him I will not, and more of his
souldiership I know not, except in that Country, he had
the honour to be the Officer at a place there called Mile-end,
to instruct for the doubling of files. I would doe the
man what honour I can, but of this I am not certaine</p><br>

<p id="id08879" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Cap.G. He hath out-villain'd villanie so farre, that the
raritie redeemes him</p><br>

<p id="id08880"> Ber. A pox on him, he's a Cat still</p><br>

<p id="id08881" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Int. His qualities being at this poore price, I neede
not to aske you, if Gold will corrupt him to reuolt</p><br>

<p id="id08882"> Par. Sir, for a Cardceue he will sell the fee-simple of
his saluation, the inheritance of it, and cut th' intaile from
all remainders, and a perpetuall succession for it perpetually</p><br>

<p id="id08883"> Int. What's his Brother, the other Captain Dumain?
 Cap.E. Why do's he aske him of me?
 Int. What's he?
 Par. E'ne a Crow a'th same nest: not altogether so
great as the first in goodnesse, but greater a great deale in
euill. He excels his Brother for a coward, yet his Brother
is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreate hee outrunnes
any Lackey; marrie in comming on, hee ha's the
Crampe</p><br>

 Int. There is no remedy sir, but you must dye: the
Generall sayes, you that haue so traitorously discouerd

of</p><br>

<p id="id08908"> La. I would I had not knowne him, it was the death
of the most vertuous gentlewoman, that euer Nature

not haue owed her a more rooted loue</p><br>

my daughter, which in the minoritie of them both, his
Maiestie out of a selfe gracious remembrance did first
propose, his Highnesse hath promis'd me to doe it, and
to stoppe vp the displeasure he hath conceiued against
your sonne, there is no fitter matter. How do's your

 La. With verie much content my Lord, and I wish

But first I begge my pardon: the yong Lord<br>

Did to his Maiesty, his Mother, and his Ladie,<br>

Offence of mighty note; but to himselfe<br>

The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife,<br>

Whose beauty did astonish the suruey<br>

Of richest eies: whose words all eares tooke captiue,<br>

Whose deere perfection, hearts that scorn'd to serue,<br>

Humbly call'd Mistris<br>

Makes the remembrance deere. Well, call him hither,<br>

We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill<br>

All repetition: Let him not aske our pardon,<br>

The nature of his great offence is dead,<br>

And deeper then obliuion, we do burie<br>

Th' incensing reliques of it. Let him approach<br>

A stranger, no offender; and informe him<br>

So 'tis our will he should<br>

Deere Soueraigne pardon to me<br>

<p id="id08987">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. All is whole,<br>

Not one word more of the consumed time,<br>

Let's take the instant by the forward top:<br>

For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees<br>

Th' inaudible, and noiselesse foot of time<br>

Steales, ere we can effect them. You remember<br>

The daughter of this Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. Admiringly my Liege, at first<br>

I stucke my choice vpon her, ere my heart<br>

Durst make too bold a herauld of my tongue:<br>

Where the impression of mine eye enfixing,<br>

Contempt his scornfull Perspectiue did lend me,<br>

Which warpt the line, of euerie other fauour,<br>

Scorn'd a faire colour, or exprest it stolne,<br>

Extended or contracted all proportions<br>

To a most hideous obiect. Thence it came,<br>

That she whom all men prais'd, and whom my selfe,<br>

Since I haue lost, haue lou'd; was in mine eye<br>

The dust that did offend it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08988">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Well excus'd:<br>

That thou didst loue her, strikes some scores away<br>

From the great compt: but loue that comes too late,<br>

Like a remorsefull pardon slowly carried<br>

To the great sender, turnes a sowre offence,<br>

Crying, that's good that's gone: Our rash faults,<br>

Make triuiall price of serious things we haue,<br>

Not knowing them, vntill we know their graue.<br>

Oft our displeasures to our selues vniust,<br>

Destroy our friends, and after weepe their dust:<br>

Our owne loue waking, cries to see what's done,<br>

While shamefull hate sleepes out the afternoone.<br>

Be this sweet Helens knell, and now forget her.<br>

Send forth your amorous token for faire Maudlin,<br>

The maine consents are had, and heere wee'l stay<br>

To see our widdowers second marriage day:<br>

Which better then the first, O deere heauen blesse,<br>

Or, ere they meete in me, O Nature cesse<br>

<p id="id08989">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. Come on my sonne, in whom my houses name<br>

Must be digested: giue a fauour from you<br>

To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,<br>

That she may quickly come. By my old beard,<br>

And eu'rie haire that's on't, Helen that's dead<br>

Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,<br>

The last that ere I tooke her leaue at Court,<br>

I saw vpon her finger<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08990"> Ber. Hers it was not</p><br>

<p id="id08991">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Now pray you let me see it. For mine eye,<br>

While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd too't:<br>

This Ring was mine, and when I gaue it Hellen,<br>

I bad her if her fortunes euer stoode<br>

Necessitied to helpe, that by this token<br>

I would releeue her. Had you that craft to reaue her<br>

Of what should stead her most?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. My gracious Soueraigne,<br>

How ere it pleases you to take it so,<br>

The ring was neuer hers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08992">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old La. Sonne, on my life<br>

I haue seene her weare it, and she reckon'd it<br>

At her liues rate<br>

<p id="id08993"> Laf. I am sure I saw her weare it</p><br>

<p id="id08994">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. You are deceiu'd my Lord, she neuer saw it:<br>

In Florence was it from a casement throwne mee,<br>

Wrap'd in a paper, which contain'd the name<br>

Of her that threw it: Noble she was, and thought<br>

I stood ingag'd, but when I had subscrib'd<br>

In heauie satisfaction, and would neuer<br>

Receiue the Ring againe<br>

Who euer gaue it you: then if you know<br>

That you are well acquainted with your selfe,<br>

Confesse 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement<br>

You got it from her. She call'd the Saints to suretie,<br>

That she would neuer put it from her finger,<br>

Vnlesse she gaue it to your selfe in bed,<br>

Where you haue neuer come: or sent it vs<br>

Vpon her great disaster<br>

<p id="id08996"> Ber. She neuer saw it</p><br>

And mak'st connecturall feares to come into me,<br>

Which I would faine shut out, if it should proue<br>

That thou art so inhumane, 'twill not proue so:<br>

And yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly,<br>

And she is dead, which nothing but to close<br>

Her eyes my selfe, could win me to beleeue,<br>

More then to see this Ring. Take him away,<br>

My fore-past proofes, how ere the matter fall<br>

Shall taze my feares of little vanitie,<br>

Hauing vainly fear'd too little. Away with him,<br>

Wee'l sift this matter further<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id08998">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. If you shall proue<br>

This Ring was euer hers, you shall as easie<br>

Whether I haue beene too blame or no, I know not,<br>

Here's a petition from a Florentine,<br>

Who hath for foure or fiue remoues come short,<br>

To tender it her selfe. I vndertooke it,<br>

Vanquish'd thereto by the faire grace and speech<br>

Of the poore suppliant, who by this I know<br>

Is heere attending: her businesse lookes in her<br>

With an importing visage, and she told me<br>

In a sweet verball breefe, it did concerne<br>

Your Highnesse with her selfe.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09001">A Letter.</p><br>

<p id="id09002">Vpon his many protestations to marrie mee when his wife was
dead, I blush to say it, he wonne me. Now is the Count Rossillion
a Widdower, his vowes are forfeited to mee, and my
honors payed to him. Hee stole from Florence, taking no
leaue, and I follow him to his Countrey for Iustice: Grant
it me, O King, in you it best lies, otherwise a seducer flourishes,
and a poore Maid is vndone.

Yet you desire to marry. What woman's that?<br>

Enter Widdow, Diana, and Parrolles.<br>

You giue away this hand, and that is mine,<br>

You giue away heauens vowes, and those are mine:<br>

You giue away my selfe, which is knowne mine:<br>

For I by vow am so embodied yours,<br>

That she which marries you, must marrie me,<br>

Either both or none<br>

She knew her distance, and did angle for mee,<br>

Madding my eagernesse with her restraint,<br>

As all impediments in fancies course<br>

Are motiues of more fancie, and in fine,<br>

Her insuite comming with her moderne grace,<br>

Subdu'd me to her rate, she got the Ring,<br>

And I had that which any inferiour might<br>

At Market price haue bought<br>

Not fearing the displeasure of your master:
Which on your iust proceeding, Ile keepe off,
By him and by this woman heere, what know you?
 Par. So please your Maiesty, my master hath bin an
honourable Gentleman. Trickes hee hath had in him,
which Gentlemen haue</p><br>

<p id="id09036">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Come, come, to'th' purpose: Did hee loue this<br>

woman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Faith sir he did loue her, but how<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09037">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. How I pray you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. He did loue her sir, as a Gent. loues a Woman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09038">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. How is that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. He lou'd her sir, and lou'd her not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09039">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. As thou art a knaue and no knaue, what an equiuocall<br>

Companion is this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. I am a poore man, and at your Maiesties command<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Par. Faith I know more then Ile speake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09042"> Kin. But wilt thou not speake all thou know'st?
 Par. Yes so please your Maiesty: I did goe betweene
them as I said, but more then that he loued her, for indeede
he was madde for her, and talkt of Sathan, and of
Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in
that credit with them at that time, that I knewe of their
going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her
marriage, and things which would deriue mee ill will to
speake of, therefore I will not speake what I know</p><br>

<p id="id09043"> Kin. Thou hast spoken all alreadie, vnlesse thou canst
say they are maried, but thou art too fine in thy euidence,
therefore stand aside. This Ring you say was yours</p><br>

<p id="id09044"> Dia. I my good Lord</p><br>

<p id="id09045">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Where did you buy it? Or who gaue it you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. It was not giuen me, nor I did not buy it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09046">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Who lent it you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. It was not lent me neither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09047">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Where did you finde it then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. I found it not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09048">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. If it were yours by none of all these wayes,<br>

How could you giue it him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. I neuer gaue it him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09049">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laf. This womans an easie gloue my Lord, she goes<br>

off and on at pleasure<br>

<p id="id09050"> Kin. This Ring was mine, I gaue it his first wife</p><br>

<p id="id09051"> Dia. It might be yours or hers for ought I know</p><br>

To prison with her: and away with him,<br>

Vnlesse thou telst me where thou hadst this Ring,<br>

Thou diest within this houre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09053"> Dia. Ile neuer tell you</p><br>

<p id="id09054"> Kin. Take her away</p><br>

<p id="id09057"> Dia. By Ioue if euer I knew man 'twas you</p><br>

<p id="id09058"> King. Wherefore hast thou accusde him al this while</p><br>

<p id="id09059">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dia. Because he's guiltie, and he is not guilty:<br>

He knowes I am no Maid, and hee'l sweare too't:<br>

Ile sweare I am a Maid, and he knowes not.<br>

Great King I am no strumpet, by my life,<br>

I am either Maid, or else this old mans wife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09060"> Kin. She does abuse our eares, to prison with her</p><br>

And he shall surety me. But for this Lord,<br>

Who hath abus'd me as he knowes himselfe,<br>

Though yet he neuer harm'd me, heere I quit him.<br>

He knowes himselfe my bed he hath defil'd,<br>

And at that time he got his wife with childe:<br>

Dead though she be, she feeles her yong one kicke:<br>

So there's my riddle, one that's dead is quicke,<br>

And now behold the meaning.<br>

Enter Hellen and Widdow.<br>

<p id="id09062">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. Is there no exorcist<br>

Beguiles the truer Office of mine eyes?<br>

Is't reall that I see?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. No my good Lord,<br>

'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,<br>

The name, and not the thing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09063"> Ros. Both, both, O pardon</p><br>

<p id="id09064">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hel. Oh my good Lord, when I was like this Maid,<br>

I found you wondrous kinde, there is your Ring,<br>

And looke you, heeres your letter: this it sayes,<br>

When from my finger you can get this Ring,<br>

And is by me with childe, &amp;c. This is done,<br>

Will you be mine now you are doubly wonne?<br>

thee: Let thy curtsies alone, they are scuruy ones<br>

To make the euen truth in pleasure flow:<br>

If thou beest yet a fresh vncropped flower,<br>

Choose thou thy husband, and Ile pay thy dower.<br>

For I can guesse, that by thy honest ayde,<br>

Thou keptst a wife her selfe, thy selfe a Maide.<br>

Of that and all the progresse more and lesse,<br>

Resoluedly more leasure shall expresse:<br>

That he did seeke the loue of faire Oliuia<br>

With this thy faire and outward charracter.<br>

For such disguise as haply shall become<br>

The forme of my intent. Ile serue this Duke,<br>

Thou shalt present me as an Eunuch to him,<br>

It may be worth thy paines: for I can sing,<br>

And speake to him in many sorts of Musicke,<br>

That will allow me very worth his seruice.<br>

What else may hap, to time I will commit,<br>

Onely shape thou thy silence to my wit<br>

to your ill houres</p><br>

<p id="id09102"> To. Why let her except, before excepted</p><br>

<p id="id09103" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ma. I, but you must confine your selfe within the
modest limits of order</p><br>

<p id="id09104"> To. Confine? Ile confine my selfe no finer then I am:
these cloathes are good enough to drinke in, and so bee
these boots too: and they be not, let them hang themselues
in their owne straps</p><br>

<p id="id09105">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. That quaffing and drinking will vndoe you: I<br>

heard my Lady talke of it yesterday: and of a foolish<br>

knight that you brought in one night here, to be hir woer<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Who, Sir Andrew Ague-cheeke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. I he<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09106"> To. He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria</p><br>

<p id="id09107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. What's that to th' purpose?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Why he ha's three thousand ducates a yeare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09108">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. I, but hee'l haue but a yeare in all these ducates:<br>

He's a very foole, and a prodigall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09109"> To. Fie, that you'l say so: he playes o'th Viol-de-gamboys,
and speaks three or four languages word for word
without booke, &amp; hath all the good gifts of nature</p><br>

<p id="id09110"> Ma. He hath indeed, almost naturall: for besides that
he's a foole, he's a great quarreller: and but that hee hath
the gift of a Coward, to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling,
'tis thought among the prudent, he would quickely
haue the gift of a graue</p><br>

<p id="id09111">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tob. By this hand they are scoundrels and substractors<br>

that say so of him. Who are they?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. They that adde moreour, hee's drunke nightly<br>

in your company<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09112"> To. With drinking healths to my Neece: Ile drinke
to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, &amp; drinke
in Illyria: he's a Coward and a Coystrill that will not
drinke to my Neece, till his braines turne o'th toe, like a
parish top. What wench? Castiliano vulgo: for here coms
Sir Andrew Agueface.
Enter Sir Andrew.</p><br>

<p id="id09113">&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Sir Toby Belch. How now sir Toby Belch?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Sweet sir Andrew<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09114"> And. Blesse you faire Shrew</p><br>

<p id="id09115"> Mar. And you too sir</p><br>

<p id="id09116"> Tob. Accost Sir Andrew, accost</p><br>

<p id="id09117">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. What's that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. My Neeces Chamber-maid<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09118">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. Good Mistris accost, I desire better acquaintance<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. My name is Mary sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09119"> And. Good mistris Mary, accost</p><br>

<p id="id09120">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To, You mistake knight: Accost, is front her, boord<br>

her, woe her, assayle her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09121">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. By my troth I would not vndertake her in this<br>

company. Is that the meaning of Accost?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. Far you well Gentlemen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09122">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. And thou let part so Sir Andrew, would thou<br>

mightst neuer draw sword agen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. And you part so mistris, I would I might neuer<br>

draw sword agen: Faire Lady, doe you thinke you haue<br>

fooles in hand?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. Sir, I haue not you by'th hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09124"> An. Marry but you shall haue, and heeres my hand</p><br>

<p id="id09125">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. Now sir, thought is free: I pray you bring your<br>

hand to'th Buttry barre, and let it drinke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09126">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. Wherefore (sweet-heart?) What's your Metaphor?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. It's dry sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09127">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Why I thinke so: I am not such an asse, but I<br>

can keepe my hand dry. But what's your iest?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. A dry iest Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Are you full of them?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. I Sir, I haue them at my fingers ends: marry now<br>

I let go your hand, I am barren.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09129">Exit Maria</p><br>

<p id="id09130"> To. O knight, thou lack'st a cup of Canarie: when did
I see thee so put downe?
 An. Neuer in your life I thinke, vnlesse you see Canarie
put me downe: mee thinkes sometimes I haue no
more wit then a Christian, or an ordinary man ha's: but I
am a great eater of beefe, and I beleeue that does harme
to my wit</p><br>

<p id="id09131"> To. No question</p><br>

<p id="id09132" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> An. And I thought that, I'de forsweare it. Ile ride
home to morrow sir Toby</p><br>

<p id="id09133"> To. Pur-quoy my deere knight?
 An. What is purquoy? Do, or not do? I would I had
bestowed that time in the tongues, that I haue in fencing
dancing, and beare-bayting: O had I but followed the
Arts</p><br>

<p id="id09134"> To. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of haire</p><br>

<p id="id09135">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. Why, would that haue mended my haire?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Past question, for thou seest it will not coole my nature<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;An. But it becoms me wel enough, dost not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaffe: &amp; I hope<br>

to see a huswife take thee between her legs, &amp; spin it off<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09136"> An. Faith Ile home to morrow sir Toby, your niece wil
not be seene, or if she be it's four to one, she'l none of me:
the Count himselfe here hard by, wooes her</p><br>

<p id="id09137"> To. Shee'l none o'th Count, she'l not match aboue hir
degree, neither in estate, yeares, nor wit: I haue heard her
swear't. Tut there's life in't man</p><br>

<p id="id09138"> And. Ile stay a moneth longer. I am a fellow o'th
strangest minde i'th world: I delight in Maskes and Reuels
sometimes altogether</p><br>

<p id="id09139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Art thou good at these kicke-chawses Knight?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. As any man in Illyria, whatsoeuer he be, vnder<br>

the degree of my betters, &amp; yet I will not compare with<br>

an old man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Faith, I can cut a caper<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09141"> To. And I can cut the Mutton too't</p><br>

<p id="id09142" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> And. And I thinke I haue the backe-tricke, simply as
strong as any man in Illyria</p><br>

<p id="id09143"> To. Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore haue
these gifts a Curtaine before 'em? Are they like to take
dust, like mistris Mals picture? Why dost thou not goe
to Church in a Galliard, and come home in a Carranto?
My verie walke should be a Iigge: I would not so much
as make water but in a Sinke-a-pace: What dooest thou
meane? Is it a world to hide vertues in? I did thinke by
the excellent constitution of thy legge, it was form'd vnder
the starre of a Galliard</p><br>

<p id="id09144">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. I, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a<br>

dam'd colour'd stocke. Shall we sit about some Reuels?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. What shall we do else: were we not borne vnder<br>

Taurus?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Taurus? That sides and heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. No sir, it is leggs and thighes: let me see thee caper.<br>

Ha, higher: ha, ha, excellent.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09146">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id09148">Enter Valentine, and Viola in mans attire.</p><br>

<p id="id09149"> Val. If the Duke continue these fauours towards you
Cesario, you are like to be much aduanc'd, he hath known
you but three dayes, and already you are no stranger</p><br>

<p id="id09150"> Vio. You either feare his humour, or my negligence,
that you call in question the continuance of his loue. Is
he inconstant sir, in his fauours</p><br>

<p id="id09151">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val. No beleeue me.<br>

Enter Duke, Curio, and Attendants.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09152"> Vio. I thanke you: heere comes the Count</p><br>

<p id="id09153">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. Who saw Cesario hoa?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. On your attendance my Lord heere<br>

Thou knowst no lesse, but all: I haue vnclasp'd<br>

To thee the booke euen of my secret soule.<br>

Therefore good youth, addresse thy gate vnto her,<br>

Be not deni'de accesse, stand at her doores,<br>

And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow<br>

Till thou haue audience<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Sure my Noble Lord,<br>

If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow<br>

As it is spoke, she neuer will admit me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09156">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Be clamorous, and leape all ciuill bounds,<br>

Rather then make vnprofited returne,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Say I do speake with her (my Lord) what then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. O then, vnfold the passion of my loue,<br>

Surprize her with discourse of my deere faith;<br>

It shall become thee well to act my woes:<br>

She will attend it better in thy youth,<br>

Then in a Nuntio's of more graue aspect<br>

<p id="id09157"> Vio. I thinke not so, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id09158">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Deere Lad, beleeue it;<br>

For they shall yet belye thy happy yeeres,<br>

That say thou art a man: Dianas lip<br>

Is not more smooth, and rubious: thy small pipe<br>

Is as the maidens organ, shrill, and sound,<br>

And all is semblatiue a womans part.<br>

I know thy constellation is right apt<br>

For this affayre: some foure or fiue attend him,<br>

All if you will: for I my selfe am best<br>

When least in companie: prosper well in this,<br>

And thou shalt liue as freely as thy Lord,<br>

To call his fortunes thine<br>

<p id="id09163"> Ma. Nay, either tell me where thou hast bin, or I will
not open my lippes so wide as a brissle may enter, in way
of thy excuse: my Lady will hang thee for thy absence</p><br>

<p id="id09164" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Let her hang me: hee that is well hang'de in this

<p id="id09166"> Clo. He shall see none to feare</p><br>

<p id="id09167">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. A good lenton answer: I can tell thee where y<br>

saying was borne, of I feare no colours<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09168">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Where good mistris Mary?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. In the warrs, &amp; that may you be bolde to say in<br>

your foolerie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09169">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Well, God giue them wisedome that haue it: &amp;<br>

those that are fooles, let them vse their talents<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09170"> Ma. Yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent,
or to be turn'd away: is not that as good as a hanging to
you?
 Clo. Many a good hanging, preuents a bad marriage:
and for turning away, let summer beare it out</p><br>

<p id="id09171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. You are resolute then?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Not so neyther, but I am resolu'd on two points<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. That if one breake, the other will hold: or if both<br>

breake, your gaskins fall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09172"> Clo. Apt in good faith, very apt: well go thy way, if
sir Toby would leaue drinking, thou wert as witty a piece
of Eues flesh, as any in Illyria</p><br>

<p id="id09173">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. Peace you rogue, no more o'that: here comes my<br>

Lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.<br>

Enter Lady Oliuia, with Maluolio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09174"> Clo. Wit, and't be thy will, put me into good fooling:
those wits that thinke they haue thee, doe very oft proue
fooles: and I that am sure I lacke thee, may passe for a
wise man. For what saies Quinapalus, Better a witty foole,
then a foolish wit. God blesse thee Lady</p><br>

<p id="id09175"> Ol. Take the foole away</p><br>

<p id="id09176"> Clo. Do you not heare fellowes, take away the Ladie</p><br>

<p id="id09177" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ol. Go too, y'are a dry foole: Ile no more of you: besides
you grow dis-honest</p><br>

<p id="id09178"> Clo. Two faults Madona, that drinke &amp; good counsell
wil amend: for giue the dry foole drink, then is the foole
not dry: bid the dishonest man mend himself, if he mend,
he is no longer dishonest; if hee cannot, let the Botcher
mend him: any thing that's mended, is but patch'd: vertu
that transgresses, is but patcht with sinne, and sin that amends,
is but patcht with vertue. If that this simple
Sillogisme will serue, so: if it will not, what remedy?
As there is no true Cuckold but calamity, so beauties a
flower; The Lady bad take away the foole, therefore I
say againe, take her away</p><br>

<p id="id09179"> Ol. Sir, I bad them take away you</p><br>

<p id="id09180"> Clo. Misprision in the highest degree. Lady, Cucullus
non facit monachum: that's as much to say, as I weare not
motley in my braine: good Madona, giue mee leaue to
proue you a foole</p><br>

<p id="id09181">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Can you do it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Dexteriously, good Madona<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09182"> Ol. Make your proofe</p><br>

<p id="id09183">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I must catechize you for it Madona, Good my<br>

Mouse of vertue answer mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09184">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Well sir, for want of other idlenesse, Ile bide your<br>

proofe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09185">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Good Madona, why mournst thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Good foole, for my brothers death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09186"> Clo. I thinke his soule is in hell, Madona</p><br>

<p id="id09187"> Ol. I know his soule is in heauen, foole</p><br>

<p id="id09188">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. The more foole (Madona) to mourne for your<br>

Brothers soule, being in heauen. Take away the Foole,<br>

Gentlemen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09189"> Ol. What thinke you of this foole Maluolio, doth he
not mend?
 Mal. Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake
him: Infirmity that decaies the wise, doth euer make the
better foole</p><br>

<p id="id09190"> Clow. God send you sir, a speedie Infirmity, for the
better increasing your folly: Sir Toby will be sworn that
I am no Fox, but he wil not passe his word for two pence
that you are no Foole</p><br>

<p id="id09191"> Ol. How say you to that Maluolio?
 Mal. I maruell your Ladyship takes delight in such
a barren rascall: I saw him put down the other day, with
an ordinary foole, that has no more braine then a stone.
Looke you now, he's out of his gard already: vnles you
laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gag'd. I protest
I take these Wisemen, that crow so at these set kinde of
fooles, no better then the fooles Zanies</p><br>

<p id="id09192"> Ol. O you are sicke of selfe-loue Maluolio, and taste
with a distemper'd appetite. To be generous, guiltlesse,
and of free disposition, is to take those things for Bird-bolts,
that you deeme Cannon bullets: There is no slander
in an allow'd foole, though he do nothing but rayle;
nor no rayling, in a knowne discreet man, though hee do
nothing but reproue</p><br>

<p id="id09193"> Clo. Now Mercury indue thee with leasing, for thou
speak'st well of fooles.

much desires to speake with you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma I know not (Madam) 'tis a faire young man, and<br>

well attended<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09196">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Who of my people hold him in delay?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma. Sir Toby Madam, your kinsman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09197"> Ol. Fetch him off I pray you, he speakes nothing but
madman: Fie on him. Go you Maluolio; If it be a suit
from the Count, I am sicke, or not at home. What you
will, to dismisse it.</p><br>

<p id="id09198">Exit Maluo.</p><br>

<p id="id09199">Now you see sir, how your fooling growes old, &amp; people
dislike it</p><br>

<p id="id09200"> Clo. Thou hast spoke for vs (Madona) as if thy eldest
sonne should be a foole: whose scull, Ioue cramme with
braines, for heere he comes.
Enter Sir Toby.</p><br>

<p id="id09201">One of thy kin has a most weake Pia-mater</p><br>

<p id="id09202">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. By mine honor halfe drunke. What is he at the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. A Gentleman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09203">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. A Gentleman? What Gentleman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. 'Tis a Gentleman heere. A plague o'these pickle<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Let him be the diuell and he will, I care not: giue<br>

me faith say I. Well, it's all one.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09207">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09208">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What's a drunken man like, foole?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Like a drown'd man, a foole, and a madde man:<br>

One draught aboue heate, makes him a foole, the second<br>

maddes him, and a third drownes him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09209"> Ol. Go thou and seeke the Crowner, and let him sitte
o'my Coz: for he's in the third degree of drinke: hee's
drown'd: go looke after him</p><br>

<p id="id09210"> Clo. He is but mad yet Madona, and the foole shall
looke to the madman.
Enter Maluolio.</p><br>

<p id="id09211"> Mal. Madam, yond young fellow sweares hee will
speake with you. I told him you were sicke, he takes on
him to vnderstand so much, and therefore comes to speak
with you. I told him you were asleepe, he seems to haue
a fore knowledge of that too, and therefore comes to
speake with you. What is to be said to him Ladie, hee's
fortified against any deniall</p><br>

<p id="id09212"> Ol. Tell him, he shall not speake with me</p><br>

<p id="id09213"> Mal. Ha's beene told so: and hee sayes hee'l stand at
your doore like a Sheriffes post, and be the supporter to
a bench, but hee'l speake with you</p><br>

<p id="id09214">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What kinde o'man is he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Why of mankinde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09215">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What manner of man?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Of verie ill manner: hee'l speake with you, will<br>

you, or no<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09216"> Ol. Of what personage, and yeeres is he?
 Mal. Not yet old enough for a man, nor yong enough
for a boy: as a squash is before tis a pescod, or a Codling
when tis almost an Apple: Tis with him in standing water,
betweene boy and man. He is verie well-fauour'd,
and he speakes verie shrewishly: One would thinke his
mothers milke were scarse out of him</p><br>

<p id="id09217"> Ol. Let him approach: Call in my Gentlewoman</p><br>

<p id="id09218">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Gentlewoman, my Lady calles.<br>

<p id="id09221">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. The honorable Ladie of the house, which is she?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Speake to me, I shall answer for her: your will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09222"> Vio. Most radiant, exquisite, and vnmatchable beautie.
I pray you tell me if this bee the Lady of the house,
for I neuer saw her. I would bee loath to cast away my
speech: for besides that it is excellently well pend, I haue
taken great paines to con it. Good Beauties, let mee sustaine
no scorne; I am very comptible, euen to the least
sinister vsage</p><br>

<p id="id09223"> Ol. Whence came you sir?
 Vio. I can say little more then I haue studied, &amp; that
question's out of my part. Good gentle one, giue mee
modest assurance, if you be the Ladie of the house, that | I
may proceede in my speech</p><br>

<p id="id09224">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Are you a Comedian?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. No my profound heart: and yet (by the verie<br>

phangs of malice, I sweare) I am not that I play. Are you<br>

the Ladie of the house?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. If I do not vsurpe my selfe, I am<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09225"> Vio. Most certaine, if you are she, you do vsurp your
selfe: for what is yours to bestowe, is, not yours to reserue.
But this is from my Commission: I will on with
my speech in your praise, and then shew you the heart of
my message</p><br>

<p id="id09226">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Come to what is important in't: I forgiue you<br>

the praise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Alas, I tooke great paines to studie it, and 'tis<br>

Poeticall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09228"> Ol. It is the more like to be feigned, I pray you keep
it in. I heard you were sawcy at my gates, &amp; allowd your
approach rather to wonder at you, then to heare you. If
you be not mad, be gone: if you haue reason, be breefe:
'tis not that time of Moone with me, to make one in so
skipping a dialogue</p><br>

<p id="id09229"> Ma. Will you hoyst sayle sir, here lies your way</p><br>

<p id="id09230"> Vio. No good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer.
Some mollification for your Giant, sweete Ladie;
tell me your minde, I am a messenger</p><br>

<p id="id09231" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ol. Sure you haue some hiddeous matter to deliuer,
when the curtesie of it is so fearefull. Speake your office</p><br>

<p id="id09232"> Vio. It alone concernes your eare: I bring no ouerture
of warre, no taxation of homage; I hold the Olyffe
in my hand: my words are as full of peace, as matter</p><br>

<p id="id09233"> Ol. Yet you began rudely. What are you?
What would you?
 Vio. The rudenesse that hath appear'd in mee, haue I
learn'd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
would, are as secret as maiden-head: to your eares, Diuinity;
to any others, prophanation</p><br>

<p id="id09234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Giue vs the place alone,<br>

We will heare this diuinitie. Now sir, what is your text?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Most sweet Ladie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. A comfortable doctrine, and much may bee saide<br>

of it. Where lies your Text?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. In Orsinoes bosome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09236">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. In his bosome? In what chapter of his bosome?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. To answer by the method, in the first of his hart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09237">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. O, I haue read it: it is heresie. Haue you no more<br>

to say?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Good Madam, let me see your face<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09238"> Ol. Haue you any Commission from your Lord, to
negotiate with my face: you are now out of your Text:
but we will draw the Curtain, and shew you the picture.
Looke you sir, such a one I was this present: Ist not well
done?
 Vio. Excellently done, if God did all</p><br>

<p id="id09239"> Ol. 'Tis in graine sir, 'twill endure winde and weather</p><br>

<p id="id09240">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white,<br>

Natures owne sweet, and cunning hand laid on:<br>

Lady, you are the cruell'st shee aliue,<br>

If you will leade these graces to the graue,<br>

And leaue the world no copie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09241"> Ol. O sir, I will not be so hard-hearted: I will giue
out diuers scedules of my beautie. It shalbe Inuentoried
and euery particle and vtensile labell'd to my will: As,
Item two lippes indifferent redde, Item two grey eyes,
with lids to them: Item, one necke, one chin, &amp; so forth.
Were you sent hither to praise me?
 Vio. I see you what you are, you are too proud:
But if you were the diuell, you are faire:
My Lord, and master loues you: O such loue
Could be but recompenc'd, though you were crown'd
The non-pareil of beautie</p><br>

<p id="id09242">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. How does he loue me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. With adorations, fertill teares,<br>

With groanes that thunder loue, with sighes of fire<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Your Lord does know my mind, I cannot loue him<br>

Yet I suppose him vertuous, know him noble,<br>

Of great estate, of fresh and stainlesse youth;<br>

In voyces well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant,<br>

And in dimension, and the shape of nature,<br>

A gracious person; But yet I cannot loue him:<br>

He might haue tooke his answer long ago<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09244">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. If I did loue you in my masters flame,<br>

With such a suffring, such a deadly life:<br>

In your deniall, I would finde no sence,<br>

I would not vnderstand it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Why, what would you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Make me a willow Cabine at your gate,<br>

And call vpon my soule within the house,<br>

Write loyall Cantons of contemned loue,<br>

And sing them lowd euen in the dead of night:<br>

Hallow your name to the reuerberate hilles,<br>

And make the babling Gossip of the aire,<br>

Cry out Oliuia: O you should not rest<br>

Betweene the elements of ayre, and earth,<br>

But you should pittie me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09246">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. You might do much:<br>

What is your Parentage?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Aboue my fortunes, yet my state is well:<br>

I am a Gentleman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09247">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Get you to your Lord:<br>

I cannot loue him: let him send no more,<br>

Vnlesse (perchance) you come to me againe,<br>

To tell me how he takes it: Fare you well:<br>

I thanke you for your paines: spend this for mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09248">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. I am no feede poast, Lady; keepe your purse,<br>

My Master, not my selfe, lackes recompence.<br>

Loue make his heart of flint, that you shal loue,<br>

And let your feruour like my masters be,<br>

Plac'd in contempt: Farwell fayre crueltie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09249">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09250">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What is your Parentage?<br>

Aboue my fortunes, yet my state is well;<br>

I am a Gentleman. Ile be sworne thou art,<br>

Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbes, actions, and spirit,<br>

Do giue thee fiue-fold blazon: not too fast: soft, soft,<br>

Vnlesse the Master were the man. How now?<br>

Euen so quickly may one catch the plague?<br>

Me thinkes I feele this youths perfections<br>

With an inuisible, and subtle stealth<br>

To creepe in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.<br>

What hoa, Maluolio.<br>

Enter Maluolio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09251"> Mal. Heere Madam, at your seruice</p><br>

<p id="id09252">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Run after that same peeuish Messenger<br>

The Countes man: he left this Ring behinde him<br>

Would I, or not: tell him, Ile none of it.<br>

Desire him not to flatter with his Lord,<br>

Nor hold him vp with hopes, I am not for him:<br>

If that the youth will come this way to morrow,<br>

Ile giue him reasons for't: hie thee Maluolio<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09253">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Madam, I will.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09254">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. I do I know not what, and feare to finde<br>

Mine eye too great a flatterer for my minde:<br>

What is decreed, must be: and be this so.<br>

<p id="id09258">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Will you stay no longer: nor will you not that<br>

I go with you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09259"> Seb. By your patience, no: my starres shine darkely
ouer me; the malignancie of my fate, might perhaps distemper
yours; therefore I shall craue of you your leaue,
that I may beare my euils alone. It were a bad recompence
for your loue, to lay any of them on you</p><br>

<p id="id09260"> An. Let me yet know of you, whither you are bound</p><br>

<p id="id09261"> Seb. No sooth sir: my determinate voyage is meere
extrauagancie. But I perceiue in you so excellent a touch
of modestie, that you will not extort from me, what I am
willing to keepe in: therefore it charges me in manners,
the rather to expresse my selfe: you must know of mee
then Antonio, my name is Sebastian (which I call'd Rodorigo)
my father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I
know you haue heard of. He left behinde him, my selfe,
and a sister, both borne in an houre: if the Heauens had
beene pleas'd, would we had so ended. But you sir, alter'd
that, for some houre before you tooke me from the
breach of the sea, was my sister drown'd</p><br>

<p id="id09262"> Ant. Alas the day</p><br>

<p id="id09263"> Seb. A Lady sir, though it was said shee much resembled
me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but thogh
I could not with such estimable wonder ouer-farre beleeue
that, yet thus farre I will boldly publish her, shee
bore a minde that enuy could not but call faire: Shee is
drown'd already sir with salt water, though I seeme to
drowne her remembrance againe with more</p><br>

<p id="id09264"> Ant. Pardon me sir, your bad entertainment</p><br>

<p id="id09265"> Seb. O good Antonio, forgiue me your trouble</p><br>

<p id="id09266" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Ant. If you will not murther me for my loue, let mee
be your seruant</p><br>

<p id="id09267"> Seb. If you will not vndo what you haue done, that is
kill him, whom you haue recouer'd, desire it not. Fare
ye well at once, my bosome is full of kindnesse, and I
am yet so neere the manners of my mother, that vpon the
least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me: I am
bound to the Count Orsino's Court, farewell.</p><br>

<p id="id09268">Exit</p><br>

But come what may, I do adore thee so,<br>

That danger shall seeme sport, and I will go.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Euen now sir, on a moderate pace, I haue since ariu'd<br>

but hither<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09273"> Mal. She returnes this Ring to you (sir) you might
haue saued mee my paines, to haue taken it away your

into a desperate assurance, she will none of him. And one
thing more, that you be neuer so hardie to come againe
in his affaires, vnlesse it bee to report your Lords taking
of this: receiue it so</p><br>

<p id="id09274"> Vio. She tooke the Ring of me, Ile none of it</p><br>

<p id="id09275"> Mal. Come sir, you peeuishly threw it to her: and
her will is, it should be so return'd: If it bee worth stooping
for, there it lies, in your eye: if not, bee it his that

Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id09276">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. I left no Ring with her: what meanes this Lady?<br>

Fortune forbid my out-side haue not charm'd her:<br>

She made good view of me, indeed so much,<br>

That me thought her eyes had lost her tongue,<br>

For she did speake in starts distractedly.<br>

She loues me sure, the cunning of her passion<br>

Inuites me in this churlish messenger:<br>

None of my Lords Ring? Why he sent her none;<br>

I am the man, if it be so, as tis,<br>

Poore Lady, she were better loue a dreame:<br>

Wherein the pregnant enemie does much.<br>

How easie is it, for the proper false<br>

In womens waxen hearts to set their formes:<br>

Alas, O frailtie is the cause, not wee,<br>

For such as we are made, if such we bee:<br>

How will this fadge? My master loues her deerely,<br>

And I (poore monster) fond asmuch on him:<br>

And she (mistaken) seemes to dote on me:<br>

What will become of this? As I am man,<br>

My state is desperate for my maisters loue:<br>

As I am woman (now alas the day)<br>

What thriftlesse sighes shall poore Oliuia breath?<br>

O time, thou must vntangle this, not I,<br>

It is too hard a knot for me t' vnty.<br>

<p id="id09281"> To. A false conclusion: I hate it as an vnfill'd Canne.
To be vp after midnight, and to go to bed then is early:
so that to go to bed after midnight, is to goe to bed betimes.
Does not our liues consist of the foure Elements?
 And. Faith so they say, but I thinke it rather consists
of eating and drinking</p><br>

<p id="id09282">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Th'art a scholler; let vs therefore eate and drinke<br>

Marian I say, a stoope of wine.<br>

of we three?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Welcome asse, now let's haue a catch<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09285"> And. By my troth the foole has an excellent breast. I
had rather then forty shillings I had such a legge, and so
sweet a breath to sing, as the foole has. Insooth thou wast
in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spok'st of
Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the Equinoctial of
Queubus: 'twas very good yfaith: I sent thee sixe pence
for thy Lemon, hadst it?
 Clo. I did impeticos thy gratillity: for Maluolios nose
is no Whip-stocke. My Lady has a white hand, and the
Mermidons are no bottle-ale houses</p><br>

<p id="id09286">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. Excellent: Why this is the best fooling, when<br>

<p id="id09290">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clowne sings .<br>

O Mistris mine where are you roming?<br>

O stay and heare, your true loues coming,<br>

Present mirth, hath present laughter:<br>

What's to come, is still vnsure.<br>

In delay there lies no plentie,<br>

Then come kisse me sweet and twentie:<br>

Youths a stuffe will not endure<br>

<p id="id09295"> To. A contagious breath</p><br>

<p id="id09296"> An. Very sweet, and contagious ifaith</p><br>

<p id="id09297"> To. To heare by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
But shall we make the Welkin dance indeed? Shall wee
rowze the night-Owle in a Catch, that will drawe three

 And. And you loue me, let's doo't: I am dogge at a

Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?
 To. We did keepe time sir in our Catches. Snecke vp</p><br>

the youth of the Counts was to day with my Lady, she is
much out of quiet. For Monsieur Maluolio, let me alone

deere knight<br>

<p id="id09334">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. I haue no exquisite reason for't, but I haue reason<br>

good enough<br>

<p id="id09335"> Mar. The diu'll a Puritane that hee is, or any thing
constantly but a time-pleaser, an affection'd Asse, that
cons State without booke, and vtters it by great swarths.
The best perswaded of himselfe: so cram'd (as he thinkes)
with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith, that all
that looke on him, loue him: and on that vice in him, will
my reuenge finde notable cause to worke</p><br>

<p id="id09336"> To. What wilt thou do?
 Mar. I will drop in his way some obscure Epistles of
loue, wherein by the colour of his beard, the shape of his
legge, the manner of his gate, the expressure of his eye,
forehead, and complection, he shall finde himselfe most
feelingly personated. I can write very like my Ladie
your Neece, on a forgotten matter wee can hardly make
distinction of our hands</p><br>

<p id="id09337"> To. Excellent, I smell a deuice</p><br>

<p id="id09338"> An. I hau't in my nose too</p><br>

<p id="id09339"> To. He shall thinke by the Letters that thou wilt drop
that they come from my Neece, and that shee's in loue
with him</p><br>

<p id="id09340"> Mar. My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour</p><br>

<p id="id09341"> An. And your horse now would make him an Asse</p><br>

<p id="id09342"> Mar. Asse, I doubt not</p><br>

<p id="id09343"> An. O twill be admirable</p><br>

<p id="id09344"> Mar. Sport royall I warrant you: I know my Physicke
will worke with him, I will plant you two, and let
the Foole make a third, where he shall finde the Letter:
obserue his construction of it: For this night to bed, and
dreame on the euent: Farewell.</p><br>

<p id="id09356">Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and others</p><br>

<p id="id09357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Giue me some Musick; Now good morow frends.<br>

Now good Cesario, but that peece of song,<br>

That old and Anticke song we heard last night;<br>

Me thought it did releeue my passion much,<br>

More then light ayres, and recollected termes<br>

Of these most briske and giddy-paced times.<br>

Come, but one verse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09358">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. He is not heere (so please your Lordshippe) that<br>

should sing it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Who was it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cur. Feste the Iester my Lord, a foole that the Ladie<br>

Oliuiaes Father tooke much delight in. He is about the<br>

house<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09359"> Du. Seeke him out, and play the tune the while.</p><br>

<p id="id09360">Musicke playes.</p><br>

<p id="id09361">Come hither Boy, if euer thou shalt loue<br>

In the sweet pangs of it, remember me:<br>

For such as I am, all true Louers are,<br>

Vnstaid and skittish in all motions else,<br>

Saue in the constant image of the creature<br>

That is belou'd. How dost thou like this tune?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. It giues a verie eccho to the seate<br>

Where loue is thron'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Thou dost speake masterly,<br>

My life vpon't, yong though thou art, thine eye<br>

Hath staid vpon some fauour that it loues:<br>

Hath it not boy?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. A little, by your fauour<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Of your complection<br>

<p id="id09364">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. She is not worth thee then. What yeares ifaith?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. About your yeeres my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09365">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Too old by heauen: Let still the woman take<br>

An elder then her selfe, so weares she to him;<br>

So swayes she leuell in her husbands heart:<br>

For boy, howeuer we do praise our selues,<br>

Our fancies are more giddie and vnfirme,<br>

More longing, wauering, sooner lost and worne,<br>

Then womens are<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09366"> Vio. I thinke it well my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id09367">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Then let thy Loue be yonger then thy selfe,<br>

Or thy affection cannot hold the bent:<br>

For women are as Roses, whose faire flowre<br>

Being once displaid, doth fall that verie howre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09368">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. And so they are: alas, that they are so:<br>

To die, euen when they to perfection grow.<br>

Enter Curio &amp; Clowne.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09369">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. O fellow come, the song we had last night:<br>

Marke it Cesario, it is old and plaine;<br>

The Spinsters and the Knitters in the Sun,<br>

And the free maides that weaue their thred with bones,<br>

Do vse to chaunt it: it is silly sooth,<br>

And dallies with the innocence of loue,<br>

Like the old age<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09370">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Are you ready Sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke. I prethee sing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09371">Musicke.</p><br>

<p id="id09372">The Song.</p><br>

<p id="id09373">Come away, come away death,<br>

And in sad cypresse let me be laide.<br>

Fye away, fie away breath,<br>

I am slaine by a faire cruell maide:<br>

My shrowd of white, stuck all with Ew, O prepare it.<br>

My part of death no one so true did share it.<br>

Not a flower, not a flower sweete<br>

On my blacke coffin, let there be strewne:<br>

Not a friend, not a friend greet<br>

My poore corpes, where my bones shall be throwne:<br>

A thousand thousand sighes to saue, lay me o where<br>

Sad true louer neuer find my graue, to weepe there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09374"> Du. There's for thy paines</p><br>

<p id="id09375"> Clo. No paines sir, I take pleasure in singing sir</p><br>

<p id="id09376"> Du. Ile pay thy pleasure then</p><br>

<p id="id09377" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Truely sir, and pleasure will be paide one time, or
another</p><br>

<p id="id09378"> Du. Giue me now leaue, to leaue thee</p><br>

<p id="id09379"> Clo. Now the melancholly God protect thee, and the
Tailor make thy doublet of changeable Taffata, for thy
minde is a very Opall. I would haue men of such constancie
put to Sea, that their businesse might be euery thing,
and their intent euerie where, for that's it, that alwayes
makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.</p><br>

<p id="id09380">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09381">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Let all the rest giue place: Once more Cesario,<br>

Get thee to yond same soueraigne crueltie:<br>

Tell her my loue, more noble then the world<br>

Prizes not quantitie of dirtie lands,<br>

The parts that fortune hath bestow'd vpon her:<br>

Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune:<br>

But 'tis that miracle, and Queene of Iems<br>

That nature prankes her in, attracts my soule<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09382"> Vio. But if she cannot loue you sir</p><br>

<p id="id09383"> Du. It cannot be so answer'd</p><br>

<p id="id09384">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Sooth but you must.<br>

Say that some Lady, as perhappes there is,<br>

Hath for your loue as great a pang of heart<br>

As you haue for Oliuia: you cannot loue her:<br>

You tel her so: Must she not then be answer'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. There is no womans sides<br>

Can bide the beating of so strong a passion,<br>

As loue doth giue my heart: no womans heart<br>

So bigge, to hold so much, they lacke retention.<br>

Alas, their loue may be call'd appetite,<br>

No motion of the Liuer, but the Pallat,<br>

That suffer surfet, cloyment, and reuolt,<br>

But mine is all as hungry as the Sea,<br>

And can digest as much, make no compare<br>

Betweene that loue a woman can beare me,<br>

And that I owe Oliuia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09385"> Vio. I but I know</p><br>

<p id="id09386">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. What dost thou knowe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Too well what loue women to men may owe:<br>

In faith they are as true of heart, as we.<br>

My Father had a daughter lou'd a man<br>

As it might be perhaps, were I a woman<br>

I should your Lordship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09387">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. And what's her history?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. A blanke my Lord: she neuer told her loue,<br>

But let concealment like a worme i'th budde<br>

Feede on her damaske cheeke: she pin'd in thought,<br>

And with a greene and yellow melancholly,<br>

She sate like Patience on a Monument,<br>

Smiling at greefe. Was not this loue indeede?<br>

We men may say more, sweare more, but indeed<br>

Our shewes are more then will: for still we proue<br>

Much in our vowes, but little in our loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09388">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. But di'de thy sister of her loue my Boy?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. I am all the daughters of my Fathers house,<br>

And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.<br>

Sir, shall I to this Lady?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. I that's the Theame,<br>

To her in haste: giue her this Iewell: say,<br>

My loue can giue no place, bide no denay.<br>

and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to mee, for euery
one of these Letters are in my name. Soft, here followes
prose: If this fall into thy hand, reuolue. In my stars
I am aboue thee, but be not affraid of greatnesse: Some
are become great, some atcheeues greatnesse, and some
haue greatnesse thrust vppon em. Thy fates open theyr
hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them, and to invre
thy selfe to what thou art like to be: cast thy humble
slough, and appeare fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman,
surly with seruants: Let thy tongue tang arguments of
state; put thy selfe into the tricke of singularitie. Shee
thus aduises thee, that sighes for thee. Remember who
commended thy yellow stockings, and wish'd to see thee
euer crosse garter'd: I say remember, goe too, thou art
made if thou desir'st to be so: If not, let me see thee a steward
still, the fellow of seruants, and not woorthie to
touch Fortunes fingers Farewell, Shee that would alter
seruices with thee, the fortunate vnhappy daylight and
champian discouers not more: This is open, I will bee
proud, I will reade politicke Authours, I will baffle Sir
Toby, I will wash off grosse acquaintance, I will be point
deuise, the very man. I do not now foole my selfe, to let
imagination iade mee; for euery reason excites to this,
that my Lady loues me. She did commend my yellow
stockings of late, shee did praise my legge being crosse-garter'd,
and in this she manifests her selfe to my loue, &amp;
with a kinde of iniunction driues mee to these habites of
her liking. I thanke my starres, I am happy: I will bee
strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and crosse Garter'd,
euen with the swiftnesse of putting on. Ioue, and my
starres be praised. Heere is yet a postscript. Thou canst
not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainst my loue, let
it appeare in thy smiling, thy smiles become thee well. Therefore
in my presence still smile, deero my sweete, I prethee. Ioue
I thanke thee, I will smile, I wil do euery thing that thou
wilt haue me.</p><br>

<p id="id09476"> Vio. I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's</p><br>

<p id="id09477">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Foolery sir, does walke about the Orbe like the<br>

Sun, it shines euery where. I would be sorry sir, but the<br>

Foole should be as oft with your Master, as with my Mistris:<br>

I thinke I saw your wisedome there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09478">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Nay, and thou passe vpon me, Ile no more with<br>

thee. Hold there's expences for thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09479">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Now Ioue in his next commodity of hayre, send<br>

thee a beard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09480">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. By my troth Ile tell thee, I am almost sicke for<br>

one, though I would not haue it grow on my chinne. Is<br>

thy Lady within?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo Would not a paire of these haue bred sir?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Yes being kept together, and put to vse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09481">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir, to bring<br>

a Cressida to this Troylus<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09482"> Vio. I vnderstand you sir, tis well begg'd</p><br>

<p id="id09483"> Clo. The matter I hope is not great sir; begging, but a
begger: Cressida was a begger. My Lady is within sir. I
will conster to them whence you come, who you are, and
what you would are out of my welkin, I might say Element,
but the word is ouer-worne.</p><br>

<p id="id09484">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09485">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. This fellow is wise enough to play the foole,<br>

And to do that well, craues a kinde of wit:<br>

He must obserue their mood on whom he iests,<br>

The quality of persons, and the time:<br>

And like the Haggard, checke at euery Feather<br>

That comes before his eye. This is a practice,<br>

As full of labour as a Wise-mans Art:<br>

For folly that he wisely shewes, is fit;<br>

But wisemens folly falne, quite taint their wit.<br>

Enter Sir Toby and Andrew.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09486"> To. Saue you Gentleman</p><br>

<p id="id09487"> Vio. And you sir</p><br>

<p id="id09488"> And. Dieu vou guard Monsieur</p><br>

<p id="id09489"> Vio. Et vouz ousie vostre seruiture</p><br>

<p id="id09490"> An. I hope sir, you are, and I am yours</p><br>

<p id="id09491">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Will you incounter the house, my Neece is desirous<br>

you should enter, if your trade be to her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09492">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. I am bound to your Neece sir, I meane she is the<br>

list of my voyage<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09493"> To. Taste your legges sir, put them to motion</p><br>

<p id="id09494" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Vio. My legges do better vnderstand me sir, then I vnderstand
what you meane by bidding me taste my legs</p><br>

<p id="id09495"> To. I meane to go sir, to enter</p><br>

<p id="id09496">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. I will answer you with gate and entrance, but we<br>

are preuented.<br>

Enter Oliuia, and Gentlewoman.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09497">Most excellent accomplish'd Lady, the heauens raine Odours
on you</p><br>

<p id="id09498"> And. That youth's a rare Courtier, raine odours, wel</p><br>

<p id="id09499">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. My matter hath no voice Lady, but to your owne<br>

most pregnant and vouchsafed eare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09500">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Odours, pregnant, and vouchsafed: Ile get 'em<br>

all three already<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09501">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Let the Garden doore be shut, and leaue mee to<br>

my hearing. Giue me your hand sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09502"> Vio. My dutie Madam, and most humble seruice</p><br>

<p id="id09503">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What is your name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Cesario is your seruants name, faire Princesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09504">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. My seruant sir? 'Twas neuer merry world,<br>

Since lowly feigning was call'd complement:<br>

Y'are seruant to the Count Orsino youth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09505">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:<br>

Your seruants seruant, is your seruant Madam<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09506">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. For him, I thinke not on him: for his thoughts,<br>

Would they were blankes, rather then fill'd with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09507">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts<br>

On his behalfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09508">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. O by your leaue I pray you.<br>

I bad you neuer speake againe of him;<br>

But would you vndertake another suite<br>

I had rather heare you, to solicit that,<br>

Then Musicke from the spheares<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09509"> Vio. Deere Lady</p><br>

<p id="id09510">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Giue me leaue, beseech you: I did send,<br>

After the last enchantment you did heare,<br>

A Ring in chace of you. So did I abuse<br>

My selfe, my seruant, and I feare me you:<br>

Vnder your hard construction must I sit,<br>

To force that on you in a shamefull cunning<br>

Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?<br>

Haue you not set mine Honor at the stake,<br>

And baited it with all th' vnmuzled thoughts<br>

That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiuing<br>

Enough is shewne, a Cipresse, not a bosome,<br>

Hides my heart: so let me heare you speake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09511"> Vio. I pittie you</p><br>

<p id="id09512"> Ol. That's a degree to loue</p><br>

<p id="id09513">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. No not a grize: for tis a vulgar proofe<br>

That verie oft we pitty enemies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09514">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Why then me thinkes 'tis time to smile agen:<br>

O world, how apt the poore are to be proud?<br>

If one should be a prey, how much the better<br>

To fall before the Lion, then the Wolfe?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09515">Clocke strikes.</p><br>

<p id="id09516">The clocke vpbraides me with the waste of time:<br>

Be not affraid good youth, I will not haue you,<br>

And yet when wit and youth is come to haruest,<br>

Your wife is like to reape a proper man:<br>

There lies your way, due West<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09517">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Then Westward hoe:<br>

Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship:<br>

You'l nothing Madam to my Lord, by me:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Stay: I prethee tell me what thou thinkst of me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. That you do thinke you are not what you are<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09518"> Ol. If I thinke so, I thinke the same of you</p><br>

<p id="id09519"> Vio. Then thinke you right: I am not what I am</p><br>

<p id="id09520"> Ol. I would you were, as I would haue you be</p><br>

<p id="id09521">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Would it be better Madam, then I am?<br>

I wish it might, for now I am your foole<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09522">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. O what a deale of scorne, lookes beautifull?<br>

In the contempt and anger of his lip,<br>

A murdrous guilt shewes not it selfe more soone,<br>

Then loue that would seeme hid: Loues night, is noone.<br>

Cesario, by the Roses of the Spring,<br>

By maid-hood, honor, truth, and euery thing,<br>

I loue thee so, that maugre all thy pride,<br>

Nor wit, nor reason, can my passion hide:<br>

Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,<br>

For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause:<br>

But rather reason thus, with reason fetter;<br>

Loue sought, is good: but giuen vnsought, is better<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09523">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. By innocence I sweare, and by my youth,<br>

I haue one heart, one bosome, and one truth,<br>

And that no woman has, nor neuer none<br>

Shall mistris be of it, saue I alone.<br>

And so adieu good Madam, neuer more,<br>

Will I my Masters teares to you deplore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09524">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Yet come againe: for thou perhaps mayst moue<br>

That heart which now abhorres, to like his loue.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09525">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id09526">Scoena Secunda.</p><br>

<p id="id09527">Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.</p><br>

<p id="id09528">&nbsp;&nbsp;And. No faith, Ile not stay a iot longer:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Thy reason deere venom, giue thy reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09529">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fab. You must needes yeelde your reason, Sir Andrew?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Marry I saw your Neece do more fauours to the<br>

Counts Seruing-man, then euer she bestow'd vpon mee:<br>

I saw't i'th Orchard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09530"> To. Did she see the while, old boy, tell me that</p><br>

<p id="id09531"> And. As plaine as I see you now</p><br>

<p id="id09532" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fab. This was a great argument of loue in her toward
you</p><br>

<p id="id09533"> And. S'light; will you make an Asse o'me</p><br>

<p id="id09534">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fab. I will proue it legitimate sir, vpon the Oathes of<br>

iudgement, and reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09535">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. And they haue beene grand Iurie men, since before<br>

Noah was a Saylor<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09536"> Fab. Shee did shew fauour to the youth in your sight,
onely to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour,
to put fire in your Heart, and brimstone in your Liuer:
you should then haue accosted her, and with some excellent
iests, fire-new from the mint, you should haue bangd
the youth into dumbenesse: this was look'd for at your
hand, and this was baulkt: the double gilt of this opportunitie
you let time wash off, and you are now sayld into
the North of my Ladies opinion, where you will hang
like an ysickle on a Dutchmans beard, vnlesse you do redeeme
it, by some laudable attempt, either of valour or
policie</p><br>

<p id="id09537" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> And. And't be any way, it must be with Valour, for
policie I hate: I had as liefe be a Brownist, as a Politician</p><br>

<p id="id09538"> To. Why then build me thy fortunes vpon the basis of
valour. Challenge me the Counts youth to fight with him
hurt him in eleuen places, my Neece shall take note of it,
and assure thy selfe, there is no loue-Broker in the world,
can more preuaile in mans commendation with woman,
then report of valour</p><br>

<p id="id09539"> Fab. There is no way but this sir Andrew</p><br>

<p id="id09540"> An. Will either of you beare me a challenge to him?
 To. Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and briefe:
it is no matter how wittie, so it bee eloquent, and full of
inuention: taunt him with the license of Inke: if thou
thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amisse, and as many
Lyes, as will lye in thy sheete of paper, although the
sheete were bigge enough for the bedde of Ware in England,
set 'em downe, go about it. Let there bee gaulle enough
in thy inke, though thou write with a Goose-pen,
no matter: about it</p><br>

<p id="id09541">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Where shall I finde you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. Wee'l call thee at the Cubiculo: Go.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09542">Exit Sir Andrew.</p><br>

<p id="id09543"> Fa. This is a deere Manakin to you Sir Toby</p><br>

<p id="id09544">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. I haue beene deere to him lad, some two thousand<br>

strong, or so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09545">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. We shall haue a rare Letter from him; but you'le<br>

not deliuer't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09546"> To. Neuer trust me then: and by all meanes stirre on
the youth to an answer. I thinke Oxen and waine-ropes
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open'd
and you finde so much blood in his Liuer, as will clog the
foote of a flea, Ile eate the rest of th' anatomy</p><br>

<p id="id09547"> Fab. And his opposit the youth beares in his visage no
great presage of cruelty.
Enter Maria.</p><br>

<p id="id09548"> To. Looke where the youngest Wren of mine comes</p><br>

<p id="id09549"> Mar. If you desire the spleene, and will laughe your
selues into stitches, follow me; yond gull Maluolio is turned
Heathen, a verie Renegatho; for there is no christian
that meanes to be saued by beleeuing rightly, can euer
beleeue such impossible passages of grossenesse. Hee's in
yellow stockings</p><br>

<p id="id09550"> To. And crosse garter'd?
 Mar. Most villanously: like a Pedant that keepes a
Schoole i'th Church: I haue dogg'd him like his murtherer.
He does obey euery point of the Letter that I dropt,
to betray him: He does smile his face into more lynes,
then is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the
Indies: you haue not seene such a thing as tis: I can hardly
forbeare hurling things at him, I know my Ladie will
strike him: if shee doe, hee'l smile, and take't for a great
fauour</p><br>

<p id="id09551"> To. Come bring vs, bring vs where he is.</p><br>

<p id="id09552">Exeunt. Omnes.</p><br>

<p id="id09553" style="margin-top: 2em">Scaena Tertia.</p><br>

<p id="id09554">Enter Sebastian and Anthonio.</p><br>

<p id="id09555">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I would not by my will haue troubled you,<br>

But since you make your pleasure of your paines,<br>

I will no further chide you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09556">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I could not stay behinde you: my desire<br>

(More sharpe then filed steele) did spurre me forth,<br>

And not all loue to see you (though so much<br>

As might haue drawne one to a longer voyage)<br>

But iealousie, what might befall your trauell,<br>

Being skillesse in these parts: which to a stranger,<br>

Vnguided, and vnfriended, often proue<br>

Rough, and vnhospitable. My willing loue,<br>

The rather by these arguments of feare<br>

Set forth in your pursuite<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09557">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. My kinde Anthonio,<br>

I can no other answer make, but thankes,<br>

And thankes: and euer oft good turnes,<br>

Are shuffel'd off with such vncurrant pay:<br>

But were my worth, as is my conscience firme,<br>

You should finde better dealing: what's to do?<br>

Shall we go see the reliques of this Towne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. To morrow sir, best first go see your Lodging?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I am not weary, and 'tis long to night<br>

I pray you let vs satisfie our eyes<br>

With the memorials, and the things of fame<br>

That do renowne this City<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09558">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Would youl'd pardon me:<br>

I do not without danger walke these streetes.<br>

Once in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his gallies,<br>

I did some seruice, of such note indeede,<br>

That were I tane heere, it would scarse be answer'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09559"> Seb. Belike you slew great number of his people</p><br>

<p id="id09560">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Th' offence is not of such a bloody nature,<br>

Albeit the quality of the time, and quarrell<br>

Might well haue giuen vs bloody argument:<br>

It might haue since bene answer'd in repaying<br>

What we tooke from them, which for Traffiques sake<br>

Most of our City did. Onely my selfe stood out,<br>

For which if I be lapsed in this place<br>

I shall pay deere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09561"> Seb. Do not then walke too open</p><br>

<p id="id09562">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. It doth not fit me: hold sir, here's my purse,<br>

In the South Suburbes at the Elephant<br>

Is best to lodge: I will bespeake our dyet,<br>

Whiles you beguile the time, and feed your knowledge<br>

With viewing of the Towne, there shall you haue me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09563">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Why I your purse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Haply your eye shall light vpon some toy<br>

You haue desire to purchase: and your store<br>

I thinke is not for idle Markets, sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09564">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. Ile be your purse-bearer, and leaue you<br>

For an houre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09565"> Ant. To th' Elephant</p><br>

<p id="id09566"> Seb. I do remember.</p><br>

<p id="id09567">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id09570">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. I haue sent after him, he sayes hee'l come:<br>

How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?<br>

For youth is bought more oft, then begg'd, or borrow'd.<br>

I speake too loud: Where's Maluolio, he is sad, and ciuill,<br>

And suites well for a seruant with my fortunes,<br>

Where is Maluolio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. He's comming Madame:<br>

But in very strange manner. He is sure possest Madam<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09571">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Why what's the matter, does he raue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. No Madam, he does nothing but smile: your Ladyship<br>

were best to haue some guard about you, if hee<br>

come, for sure the man is tainted in's wits<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09572">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Go call him hither.<br>

Enter Maluolio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09573">I am as madde as hee,<br>

If sad and merry madnesse equall bee.<br>

How now Maluolio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Sweet Lady, ho, ho<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09574"> Ol. Smil'st thou? I sent for thee vpon a sad occasion</p><br>

<p id="id09575">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Sad Lady, I could be sad:<br>

This does make some obstruction in the blood:<br>

This crosse-gartering, but what of that?<br>

If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true<br>

Sonnet is: Please one, and please all<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09576"> Mal. Why how doest thou man?
What is the matter with thee?
 Mal. Not blacke in my minde, though yellow in my
legges: It did come to his hands, and Commaunds shall
be executed. I thinke we doe know the sweet Romane
hand</p><br>

<p id="id09577">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Wilt thou go to bed Maluolio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. To bed? I sweet heart, and Ile come to thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09578">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. God comfort thee: Why dost thou smile so, and<br>

kisse thy hand so oft?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. How do you Maluolio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Maluo. At your request:<br>

Yes Nightingales answere Dawes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09579">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. Why appeare you with this ridiculous boldnesse<br>

before my Lady<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09580"> Mal. Be not afraid of greatnesse: 'twas well writ</p><br>

<p id="id09581">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What meanst thou by that Maluolio?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Some are borne great<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09582">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Ha?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Some atcheeue greatnesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09583">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What sayst thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. And some haue greatnesse thrust vpon them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09584"> Ol. Heauen restore thee</p><br>

<p id="id09585"> Mal. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings</p><br>

<p id="id09586">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Thy yellow stockings?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. And wish'd to see thee crosse garter'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09587">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Crosse garter'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Go too, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09588">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Am I made?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. If not, let me see thee a seruant still<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09589">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Why this is verie Midsommer madnesse.<br>

Enter Seruant.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09590"> Ser. Madame, the young Gentleman of the Count
Orsino's is return'd, I could hardly entreate him backe: he
attends your Ladyships pleasure</p><br>

<p id="id09591"> Ol. Ile come to him.
Good Maria, let this fellow be look'd too. Where's my
Cosine Toby, let some of my people haue a speciall care
of him, I would not haue him miscarrie for the halfe of
my Dowry.</p><br>

<p id="id09592">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09593"> Mal. Oh ho, do you come neere me now: no worse
man then sir Toby to looke to me. This concurres directly
with the Letter, she sends him on purpose, that I may
appeare stubborne to him: for she incites me to that in
the Letter. Cast thy humble slough sayes she: be opposite
with a Kinsman, surly with seruants, let thy tongue
langer with arguments of state, put thy selfe into the
tricke of singularity: and consequently setts downe the
manner how: as a sad face, a reuerend carriage, a slow
tongue, in the habite of some Sir of note, and so foorth.
I haue lymde her, but it is Ioues doing, and Ioue make me
thankefull. And when she went away now, let this Fellow
be look'd too: Fellow? not Maluolio, nor after my
degree, but Fellow. Why euery thing adheres togither,
that no dramme of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no
obstacle, no incredulous or vnsafe circumstance: What
can be saide? Nothing that can be, can come betweene
me, and the full prospect of my hopes. Well Ioue, not I,
is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
Enter Toby, Fabian, and Maria.</p><br>

<p id="id09594"> To. Which way is hee in the name of sanctity. If all
the diuels of hell be drawne in little, and Legion himselfe
possest him, yet Ile speake to him</p><br>

<p id="id09595">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fab. Heere he is, heere he is: how ist with you sir?<br>

How ist with you man?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Go off, I discard you: let me enioy my priuate:<br>

go off<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09596"> Mar. Lo, how hollow the fiend speakes within him;
did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my Lady prayes you to haue
a care of him</p><br>

<p id="id09597"> Mal. Ah ha, does she so?
 To. Go too, go too: peace, peace, wee must deale
gently with him: Let me alone. How do you Maluolio?
How ist with you? What man, defie the diuell: consider,
he's an enemy to mankinde</p><br>

<p id="id09598">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Do you know what you say?<br>

My Neece is already in the beleefe that he's mad: we may
carry it thus for our pleasure, and his pennance, til our very

<p id="id09631"> Mar. You may haue verie fit occasion for't: he is now
in some commerce with my Ladie, and will by and by
depart</p><br>

<p id="id09632"> To. Go sir Andrew: scout mee for him at the corner
of the Orchard like a bum-Baylie: so soone as euer thou
seest him, draw, and as thou draw'st, sweare horrible: for
it comes to passe oft, that a terrible oath, with a swaggering
accent sharpely twang'd off, giues manhoode more
approbation, then euer proofe it selfe would haue earn'd
him. Away</p><br>

<p id="id09633"> And. Nay let me alone for swearing.</p><br>

<p id="id09634">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09635"> To. Now will not I deliuer his Letter: for the behauiour
of the yong Gentleman, giues him out to be of good
capacity, and breeding: his employment betweene his
Lord and my Neece, confirmes no lesse. Therefore, this
Letter being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror
in the youth: he will finde it comes from a Clodde-pole.
But sir, I will deliuer his Challenge by word of mouth;
set vpon Ague-cheeke a notable report of valor, and driue
the Gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receiue it)
into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, furie, and
impetuositie. This will so fright them both, that they wil
kill one another by the looke, like Cockatrices.
Enter Oliuia and Viola.</p><br>

till he take leaue, and presently after him<br>

<p id="id09637">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. I wil meditate the while vpon some horrid message<br>

for a Challenge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09638">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. I haue said too much vnto a hart of stone,<br>

And laid mine honour too vnchary on't:<br>

There's something in me that reproues my fault:<br>

But such a head-strong potent fault it is,<br>

That it but mockes reproofe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09639">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. With the same hauiour that your passion beares,<br>

Goes on my Masters greefes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09640">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Heere, weare this Iewell for me, tis my picture:<br>

Refuse it not, it hath no tongue, to vex you:<br>

And I beseech you come againe to morrow.<br>

What shall you aske of me that Ile deny,<br>

That honour (sau'd) may vpon asking giue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09641"> Vio. Nothing but this, your true loue for my master</p><br>

Which I haue giuen to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09643"> Vio. I will acquit you</p><br>

<p id="id09644">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Well, come againe to morrow: far-thee-well,<br>

A Fiend like thee might beare my soule to hell.<br>

Enter Toby and Fabian.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09645"> To. Gentleman, God saue thee</p><br>

<p id="id09646"> Vio. And you sir</p><br>

<p id="id09647"> To. That defence thou hast, betake the too't: of what
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I knowe not:
but thy intercepter full of despight, bloody as the Hunter,
attends thee at the Orchard end: dismount thy tucke,
be yare in thy preparation, for thy assaylant is quick, skilfull,
and deadly</p><br>

<p id="id09648"> Vio. You mistake sir I am sure, no man hath any quarrell
to me: my remembrance is very free and cleere from
any image of offence done to any man</p><br>

<p id="id09649"> To. You'l finde it otherwise I assure you: therefore, if
you hold your life at any price, betake you to your gard:
for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill,
and wrath, can furnish man withall</p><br>

<p id="id09650"> Vio. I pray you sir what is he?
 To. He is knight dubb'd with vnhatch'd Rapier, and
on carpet consideration, but he is a diuell in priuate brall,
soules and bodies hath he diuorc'd three, and his incensement
at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction
can be none, but by pangs of death and sepulcher: Hob,
nob, is his word: giu't or take't</p><br>

<p id="id09651"> Vio. I will returne againe into the house, and desire
some conduct of the Lady. I am no fighter, I haue heard
of some kinde of men, that put quarrells purposely on others,
to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that
quirke</p><br>

<p id="id09652"> To. Sir, no: his indignation deriues it selfe out of a very
computent iniurie, therefore get you on, and giue him
his desire. Backe you shall not to the house, vnlesse you
vndertake that with me, which with as much safetie you
might answer him: therefore on, or strippe your sword
starke naked: for meddle you must that's certain, or forsweare
to weare iron about you</p><br>

<p id="id09653"> Vio. This is as vnciuill as strange. I beseech you doe
me this courteous office, as to know of the Knight what
my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence,
nothing of my purpose</p><br>

<p id="id09654">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. I will doe so. Signiour Fabian, stay you by this<br>

Gentleman, till my returne.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09655">Exit Toby.</p><br>

<p id="id09656">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Pray you sir, do you know of this matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fab. I know the knight is incenst against you, euen to<br>

a mortall arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance<br>

more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09657"> Vio. I beseech you what manner of man is he?
 Fab. Nothing of that wonderfull promise to read him
by his forme, as you are like to finde him in the proofe of
his valour. He is indeede sir, the most skilfull, bloudy, &amp;
fatall opposite that you could possibly haue found in anie
part of Illyria: will you walke towards him, I will make
your peace with him, if I can</p><br>

<p id="id09658"> Vio. I shall bee much bound to you for't: I am one,
that had rather go with sir Priest, then sir knight: I care
not who knowes so much of my mettle.</p><br>

<p id="id09659">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id09660">Enter Toby and Andrew.</p><br>

<p id="id09661"> To. Why man hee s a verie diuell, I haue not seen such
a firago: I had a passe with him, rapier, scabberd, and all:
and he giues me the stucke in with such a mortall motion
that it is ineuitable: and on the answer, he payes you as
surely, as your feete hits the ground they step on. They
say, he has bin Fencer to the Sophy</p><br>

<p id="id09662"> And. Pox on't, Ile not meddle with him</p><br>

<p id="id09663">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. I but he will not now be pacified,<br>

Fabian can scarse hold him yonder<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09664">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An. Plague on't, and I thought he had beene valiant,<br>

and so cunning in Fence, I'de haue seene him damn'd ere<br>

I'de haue challeng'd him. Let him let the matter slip, and<br>

Ile giue him my horse, gray Capilet<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09665"> To. Ile make the motion: stand heere, make a good
shew on't, this shall end without the perdition of soules,
marry Ile ride your horse as well as I ride you.
Enter Fabian and Viola.</p><br>

<p id="id09666">I haue his horse to take vp the quarrell, I haue perswaded
him the youths a diuell</p><br>

<p id="id09667">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fa. He is as horribly conceited of him: and pants, &amp;<br>

lookes pale, as if a Beare were at his heeles<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09668"> To. There's no remedie sir, he will fight with you for's
oath sake: marrie hee hath better bethought him of his
quarrell, and hee findes that now scarse to bee worth talking
of: therefore draw for the supportance of his vowe,
he protests he will not hurt you</p><br>

<p id="id09669" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Vio. Pray God defend me: a little thing would make
me tell them how much I lacke of a man</p><br>

<p id="id09670"> Fab. Giue ground if you see him furious</p><br>

<p id="id09671"> To. Come sir Andrew, there's no remedie, the Gentleman
will for his honors sake haue one bowt with you:
he cannot by the Duello auoide it: but hee has promised
me, as he is a Gentleman and a Soldiour, he will not hurt
you. Come on, too't</p><br>

If you offend him, I for him defie you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09675">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To. You sir? Why, what are you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. One sir, that for his loue dares yet do more<br>

Then you haue heard him brag to you he will<br>

<p id="id09680"> And. Marry will I sir: and for that I promis'd you Ile
be as good as my word. Hee will beare you easily, and
raines well</p><br>

Though now you haue no sea-cap on your head:
Take him away, he knowes I know him well</p><br>

<p id="id09684">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. I must obey. This comes with seeking you:<br>

But there's no remedie, I shall answer it:<br>

What will you do: now my necessitie<br>

Makes me to aske you for my purse. It greeues mee<br>

Much more, for what I cannot do for you,<br>

Then what befals my selfe: you stand amaz'd,<br>

But be of comfort<br>

For the fayre kindnesse you haue shew'd me heere,<br>

And part being prompted by your present trouble,<br>

Out of my leane and low ability<br>

Ile lend you something: my hauing is not much,<br>

Ile make diuision of my present with you:<br>

Hold, there's halfe my Coffer<br>

<p id="id09688">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Will you deny me now,<br>

Ist possible that my deserts to you<br>

Can lacke perswasion. Do not tempt my misery,<br>

Least that it make me so vnsound a man<br>

As to vpbraid you with those kindnesses<br>

That I haue done for you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09689">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. I know of none,<br>

Nor know I you by voyce, or any feature:<br>

I hate ingratitude more in a man,<br>

Then lying, vainnesse, babling drunkennesse,<br>

Or any taint of vice, whose strong corruption<br>

Inhabites our fraile blood<br>

<p id="id09691"> 2.Off. Come sir, I pray you go</p><br>

Releeu'd him with such sanctitie of loue;<br>

And to his image, which me thought did promise<br>

Most venerable worth, did I deuotion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09693"> 1.Off. What's that to vs, the time goes by: Away</p><br>

Thou hast Sebastian done good feature, shame.<br>

In Nature, there's no blemish but the minde:<br>

None can be call'd deform'd, but the vnkinde.<br>

Vertue is beauty, but the beauteous euill<br>

Are empty trunkes, ore-flourish'd by the deuill<br>

scholler. The Competitors enter.
Enter Toby.</p><br>

<p id="id09734"> To. Ioue blesse thee M[aster]. Parson</p><br>

<p id="id09735"> Clo. Bonos dies sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prage
that neuer saw pen and inke, very wittily sayd to a Neece
of King Gorbodacke, that that is, is: so I being M[aster]. Parson,
am M[aster]. Parson; for what is that, but that? and is, but is?
 To. To him sir Topas</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Sir Topas the Curate, who comes to visit Maluolio<br>

the Lunaticke<br>

<p id="id09740">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Sir Topas, sir Topas, good sir Topas goe to my<br>

Ladie<br>

<p id="id09741">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Out hyperbolicall fiend, how vexest thou this<br>

man? Talkest thou nothing but of Ladies?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tob. Well said M[aster]. Parson<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09742"> Mal. Sir Topas, neuer was man thus wronged, good
sir Topas do not thinke I am mad: they haue layde mee
heere in hideous darknesse</p><br>

<p id="id09743"> Clo. Fye, thou dishonest sathan: I call thee by the
most modest termes, for I am one of those gentle ones,
that will vse the diuell himselfe with curtesie: sayst thou
that house is darke?
 Mal. As hell sir Topas</p><br>

<p id="id09744"> Clo. Why it hath bay Windowes transparant as baricadoes,
and the cleere stores toward the South north, are
as lustrous as Ebony: and yet complainest thou of obstruction?
 Mal. I am not mad sir Topas, I say to you this house is
darke</p><br>

<p id="id09745"> Clo. Madman thou errest: I say there is no darknesse
but ignorance, in which thou art more puzel'd then the
aegyptians in their fogge</p><br>

<p id="id09746"> Mal. I say this house is as darke as Ignorance, thogh
Ignorance were as darke as hell; and I say there was neuer
man thus abus'd, I am no more madde then you are,
make the triall of it in any constant question</p><br>

<p id="id09747">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning<br>

Wilde-fowle?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. That the soule of our grandam, might happily<br>

inhabite a bird<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09748">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. What thinkst thou of his opinion?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. I thinke nobly of the soule, and no way aproue<br>

his opinion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09749"> Clo. Fare thee well: remaine thou still in darkenesse,
thou shalt hold th' opinion of Pythagoras, ere I will allow
of thy wits, and feare to kill a Woodcocke, lest thou dispossesse
the soule of thy grandam. Fare thee well</p><br>

<p id="id09750"> Mal. Sir Topas, sir Topas</p><br>

<p id="id09751"> Tob. My most exquisite sir Topas</p><br>

Yet 'tis not madnesse. Where's Anthonio then,<br>

I could not finde him at the Elephant,<br>

Yet there he was, and there I found this credite,<br>

That he did range the towne to seeke me out,<br>

His councell now might do me golden seruice,<br>

For though my soule disputes well with my sence,<br>

That this may be some error, but no madnesse,<br>

Yet doth this accident and flood of Fortune,<br>

So farre exceed all instance, all discourse,<br>

That I am readie to distrust mine eyes,<br>

And wrangle with my reason that perswades me<br>

To any other trust, but that I am mad,<br>

Take, and giue backe affayres, and their dispatch,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Truely sir, the better for my foes, and the worse<br>

for my friends<br>

<p id="id09796"> Du. Iust the contrary: the better for thy friends</p><br>

<p id="id09797"> Clo. No sir, the worse</p><br>

<p id="id09798"> Du. How can that be?
 Clo. Marry sir, they praise me, and make an asse of me,
now my foes tell me plainly, I am an Asse: so that by my
foes sir, I profit in the knowledge of my selfe, and by my
friends I am abused: so that conclusions to be as kisses, if
your foure negatiues make your two affirmatiues, why
then the worse for my friends, and the better for my foes</p><br>

<p id="id09806"> Clo. Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the olde

you in minde, one, two, three</p><br>

<p id="id09811"> Vio. Here comes the man sir, that did rescue mee</p><br>

<p id="id09812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. That face of his I do remember well,<br>

Yet when I saw it last, it was besmear'd<br>

As blacke as Vulcan, in the smoake of warre:<br>

A bawbling Vessell was he Captaine of,<br>

For shallow draught and bulke vnprizable,<br>

With which such scathfull grapple did he make,<br>

With the most noble bottome of our Fleete,<br>

That very enuy, and the tongue of losse<br>

Cride fame and honor on him: What's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Offi. Orsino, this is that Anthonio<br>

That tooke the Phoenix, and her fraught from Candy,<br>

And this is he that did the Tiger boord,<br>

When your yong Nephew Titus lost his legge;<br>

Heere in the streets, desperate of shame and state,<br>

In priuate brabble did we apprehend him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. He did me kindnesse sir, drew on my side,<br>

But in conclusion put strange speech vpon me,<br>

I know not what 'twas, but distraction<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09814">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Notable Pyrate, thou salt-water Theefe,<br>

What foolish boldnesse brought thee to their mercies,<br>

Whom thou in termes so bloudie, and so deere<br>

Hast made thine enemies?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. Orsino: Noble sir,<br>

Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you giue mee:<br>

Anthonio neuer yet was Theefe, or Pyrate,<br>

Though I confesse, on base and ground enough<br>

Orsino's enemie. A witchcraft drew me hither:<br>

That most ingratefull boy there by your side,<br>

From the rude seas enrag'd and foamy mouth<br>

Did I redeeme: a wracke past hope he was:<br>

His life I gaue him, and did thereto adde<br>

My loue without retention, or restraint,<br>

All his in dedication. For his sake,<br>

Did I expose my selfe (pure for his loue)<br>

Into the danger of this aduerse Towne,<br>

Drew to defend him, when he was beset:<br>

Where being apprehended, his false cunning<br>

(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)<br>

Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,<br>

And grew a twentie yeeres remoued thing<br>

While one would winke: denide me mine owne purse,<br>

Which I had recommended to his vse,<br>

Not halfe an houre before<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09815">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. How can this be?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. When came he to this Towne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ant. To day my Lord: and for three months before,<br>

No intrim, not a minutes vacancie,<br>

Both day and night did we keepe companie.<br>

Enter Oliuia and attendants.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09816">&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Heere comes the Countesse, now heauen walkes<br>

on earth:<br>

But for thee fellow, fellow thy words are madnesse,<br>

Three monthes this youth hath tended vpon mee,<br>

But more of that anon. Take him aside<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What would my Lord, but that he may not haue,<br>

Wherein Oliuia may seeme seruiceable?<br>

Cesario, you do not keepe promise with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Madam:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Gracious Oliuia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09819"> Ol. What do you say Cesario? Good my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id09820"> Vio. My Lord would speake, my dutie hushes me</p><br>

<p id="id09821">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. If it be ought to the old tune my Lord,<br>

It is as fat and fulsome to mine eare<br>

As howling after Musicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09822">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Still so cruell?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Still so constant Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09823">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. What to peruersenesse? you vnciuill Ladie<br>

To whose ingrate, and vnauspicious Altars<br>

My soule the faithfull'st offrings haue breath'd out<br>

That ere deuotion tender'd. What shall I do?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Euen what it please my Lord, that shal becom him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Why should I not, (had I the heart to do it)<br>

Like to th' Egyptian theefe, at point of death<br>

Kill what I loue: (a sauage iealousie,<br>

That sometime sauours nobly) but heare me this:<br>

Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,<br>

And that I partly know the instrument<br>

That screwes me from my true place in your fauour:<br>

Liue you the Marble-brested Tirant still.<br>

But this your Minion, whom I know you loue,<br>

And whom, by heauen I sweare, I tender deerely,<br>

Him will I teare out of that cruell eye,<br>

Where he sits crowned in his masters spight.<br>

Come boy with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischiefe:<br>

Ile sacrifice the Lambe that I do loue,<br>

To spight a Rauens heart within a Doue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09824">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. And I most iocund, apt, and willinglie,<br>

To do you rest, a thousand deaths would dye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09825">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Where goes Cesario?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. After him I loue,<br>

More then I loue these eyes, more then my life,<br>

More by all mores, then ere I shall loue wife.<br>

If I do feigne, you witnesses aboue<br>

Punish my life, for tainting of my loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09826">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Aye me detested, how am I beguil'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Hast thou forgot thy selfe? Is it so long?<br>

Call forth the holy Father<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09827"> Du. Come, away</p><br>

<p id="id09828"> Ol. Whether my Lord? Cesario, Husband, stay</p><br>

<p id="id09829">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Husband?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. I Husband. Can he that deny?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. Her husband, sirrah?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. No my Lord, not I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09830">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Alas, it is the basenesse of thy feare,<br>

That makes thee strangle thy propriety:<br>

Feare not Cesario, take thy fortunes vp,<br>

Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art<br>

As great as that thou fear'st.<br>

Enter Priest.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09831">O welcome Father:<br>

Father, I charge thee by thy reuerence<br>

Heere to vnfold, though lately we intended<br>

To keepe in darkenesse, what occasion now<br>

Reueales before 'tis ripe: what thou dost know<br>

Hath newly past, betweene this youth, and me<br>

<p id="id09832">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest. A Contract of eternall bond of loue,<br>

Confirm'd by mutuall ioynder of your hands,<br>

Attested by the holy close of lippes,<br>

Strengthned by enterchangement of your rings,<br>

And all the Ceremonie of this compact<br>

Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:<br>

Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my graue<br>

I haue trauail'd but two houres<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09833">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. O thou dissembling Cub: what wilt thou be<br>

When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?<br>

Or will not else thy craft so quickely grow,<br>

That thine owne trip shall be thine ouerthrow:<br>

Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feete,<br>

Where thou, and I (henceforth) may neuer meet<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09834"> Vio. My Lord, I do protest</p><br>

<p id="id09835">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. O do not sweare,<br>

Hold little faith, though thou hast too much feare.<br>

Enter Sir Andrew.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09836">&nbsp;&nbsp;And. For the loue of God a Surgeon, send one presently<br>

to sir Toby<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09837">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. What's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. H'as broke my head acrosse, and has giuen Sir<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby a bloody Coxcombe too: for the loue of God your<br>

helpe, I had rather then forty pound I were at home<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09838">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Who has done this sir Andrew?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. The Counts Gentleman, one Cesario: we tooke<br>

him for a Coward, but hee's the verie diuell, incardinate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09839">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. My Gentleman Cesario?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And. Odd's lifelings heere he is: you broke my head<br>

for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do't by sir<br>

Toby<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09840">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Why do you speake to me, I neuer hurt you:<br>

You drew your sword vpon me without cause,<br>

But I bespake you faire, and hurt you not.<br>

Enter Toby and Clowne.<br>

he had not beene in drinke, hee would haue tickel'd you
other gates then he did</p><br>

<p id="id09842">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du. How now Gentleman? how ist with you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To. That's all one, has hurt me, and there's th' end on't:<br>

Sot, didst see Dicke Surgeon, sot?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. O he's drunke sir Toby an houre agone: his eyes<br>

were set at eight i'th morning<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ol. Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd too.<br>

Enter Sebastian.<br>

<p id="id09846">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seb. I am sorry Madam I haue hurt your kinsman:<br>

But had it beene the brother of my blood,<br>

I must haue done no lesse with wit and safety.<br>

You throw a strange regard vpon me, and by that<br>

I do perceiue it hath offended you:<br>

Pardon me (sweet one) euen for the vowes<br>

We made each other, but so late ago<br>

Nor can there be that Deity in my nature<br>

Whom the blinde waues and surges haue deuour'd:<br>

Of charity, what kinne are you to me?<br>

What Countreyman? What name? What Parentage?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vio. Of Messaline: Sebastian was my Father,<br>

So went he suited to his watery tombe:<br>

You would haue bin contracted to a Maid,<br>

As o're-dy'd Blacks, as Wind, as Waters; false<br>

As Dice are to be wish'd, by one that fixes<br>

No borne 'twixt his and mine; yet were it true,<br>

Affection? thy Intention stabs the Center.<br>

Thou do'st make possible things not so held,<br>

Communicat'st with Dreames (how can this be?)<br>

With what's vnreall: thou coactiue art,<br>

And fellow'st nothing. Then 'tis very credent,<br>

Thou may'st co-ioyne with something, and thou do'st,<br>

(And that beyond Commission) and I find it,<br>

(And that to the infection of my Braines,<br>

And hardning of my Browes.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. What meanes Sicilia?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. He something seemes vnsetled<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09928">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. How? my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. What cheere? how is't with you, best Brother?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. You look as if you held a Brow of much distraction:<br>

Are you mou'd (my Lord?)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. No, in good earnest.<br>

How sometimes Nature will betray it's folly?<br>

It's tendernesse? and make it selfe a Pastime<br>

To harder bosomes? Looking on the Lynes<br>

Of my Boyes face, me thoughts I did requoyle<br>

Twentie three yeeres, and saw my selfe vn-breech'd,<br>

In my greene Veluet Coat; my Dagger muzzel'd,<br>

Least it should bite it's Master, and so proue<br>

(As Ornaments oft do's) too dangerous:<br>

How like (me thought) I then was to this Kernell,<br>

This Squash, this Gentleman. Mine honest Friend,<br>

Will you take Egges for Money?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mam. No (my Lord) Ile fight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09929">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. You will: why happy man be's dole. My Brother<br>

Are you so fond of your young Prince, as we<br>

Doe seeme to be of ours?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. If at home (Sir)<br>

He's all my Exercise, my Mirth, my Matter;<br>

Now my sworne Friend, and then mine Enemy;<br>

My Parasite, my Souldier: States-man; all:<br>

He makes a Iulyes day, short as December,<br>

And with his varying childnesse, cures in me<br>

Thoughts, that would thick my blood<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09930">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. So stands this Squire<br>

Offic'd with me: We two will walke (my Lord)<br>

And leaue you to your grauer steps. Hermione,<br>

How thou lou'st vs, shew in our Brothers welcome;<br>

Let what is deare in Sicily, be cheape:<br>

Next to thy selfe, and my young Rouer, he's<br>

Apparant to my heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09931">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. If you would seeke vs,<br>

We are yours i'th' Garden: shall's attend you there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. To your owne bents dispose you: you'le be found,<br>

Be you beneath the Sky: I am angling now,<br>

(Though you perceiue me not how I giue Lyne)<br>

Goe too, goe too.<br>

How she holds vp the Neb? the Byll to him?<br>

And armes her with the boldnesse of a Wife<br>

To her allowing Husband. Gone already,<br>

Ynch-thick, knee-deepe; ore head and eares a fork'd one.<br>

Goe play (Boy) play: thy Mother playes, and I<br>

Play too; but so disgrac'd a part, whose issue<br>

Will hisse me to my Graue: Contempt and Clamor<br>

Will be my Knell. Goe play (Boy) play, there haue been<br>

(Or I am much deceiu'd) Cuckolds ere now,<br>

And many a man there is (euen at this present,<br>

Now, while I speake this) holds his Wife by th' Arme,<br>

That little thinkes she ha's been sluyc'd in's absence,<br>

And his Pond fish'd by his next Neighbor (by<br>

Sir Smile, his Neighbor:) nay, there's comfort in't,<br>

Whiles other men haue Gates, and those Gates open'd<br>

(As mine) against their will. Should all despaire<br>

That haue reuolted Wiues, the tenth of Mankind<br>

Would hang themselues. Physick for't, there's none:<br>

It is a bawdy Planet, that will strike<br>

Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powrefull: thinke it:<br>

From East, West, North, and South, be it concluded,<br>

No Barricado for a Belly. Know't,<br>

It will let in and out the Enemy,<br>

With bag and baggage: many thousand on's<br>

Haue the Disease, and feele't not. How now Boy?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mam. I am like you say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09932">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Why, that's some comfort.<br>

What? Camillo there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. I, my good Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09933">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Goe play (Mamillius) thou'rt an honest man:<br>

Camillo, this great Sir will yet stay longer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09934">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. You had much adoe to make his Anchor hold,<br>

When you cast out, it still came home<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09935">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Didst note it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. He would not stay at your Petitions, made<br>

His Businesse more materiall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09936">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Didst perceiue it?<br>

They're here with me already; whisp'ring, rounding:<br>

Sicilia is a so-forth: 'tis farre gone,<br>

When I shall gust it last. How cam't (Camillo)<br>

That he did stay?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. At the good Queenes entreatie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09937">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. At the Queenes be't: Good should be pertinent,<br>

But so it is, it is not. Was this taken<br>

By any vnderstanding Pate but thine?<br>

For thy Conceit is soaking, will draw in<br>

More then the common Blocks. Not noted, is't,<br>

But of the finer Natures? by some Seueralls<br>

Of Head-peece extraordinarie? Lower Messes<br>

Perchance are to this Businesse purblind? say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09938">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Businesse, my Lord? I thinke most vnderstand<br>

Bohemia stayes here longer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09939">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Ha?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Stayes here longer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09940">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. I, but why?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. To satisfie your Highnesse, and the Entreaties<br>

Of our most gracious Mistresse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09941">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Satisfie?<br>

Th' entreaties of your Mistresse? Satisfie?<br>

Let that suffice. I haue trusted thee (Camillo)<br>

With all the neerest things to my heart, as well<br>

My Chamber-Councels, wherein (Priest-like) thou<br>

Hast cleans'd my Bosome: I, from thee departed<br>

Thy Penitent reform'd: but we haue been<br>

Deceiu'd in thy Integritie, deceiu'd<br>

In that which seemes so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09942">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Be it forbid (my Lord.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. To bide vpon't: thou art not honest: or<br>

If thou inclin'st that way, thou art a Coward,<br>

Which hoxes honestie behind, restrayning<br>

From Course requir'd: or else thou must be counted<br>

A Seruant, grafted in my serious Trust,<br>

And therein negligent: or else a Foole,<br>

That seest a Game play'd home, the rich Stake drawne,<br>

And tak'st it all for ieast<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09943">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. My gracious Lord,<br>

I may be negligent, foolish, and fearefull,<br>

In euery one of these, no man is free,<br>

But that his negligence, his folly, feare,<br>

Among the infinite doings of the World,<br>

Sometime puts forth in your affaires (my Lord.)<br>

If euer I were wilfull-negligent,<br>

It was my folly: if industriously<br>

I play'd the Foole, it was my negligence,<br>

Not weighing well the end: if euer fearefull<br>

To doe a thing, where I the issue doubted,<br>

Whereof the execution did cry out<br>

Against the non-performance, 'twas a feare<br>

Which oft infects the wisest: these (my Lord)<br>

Are such allow'd Infirmities, that honestie<br>

Is neuer free of. But beseech your Grace<br>

Be plainer with me, let me know my Trespas<br>

By it's owne visage; if I then deny it,<br>

'Tis none of mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09944">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Ha' not you seene Camillo?<br>

(But that's past doubt: you haue, or your eye-glasse<br>

Is thicker then a Cuckolds Horne) or heard?<br>

(For to a Vision so apparant, Rumor<br>

Cannot be mute) or thought? (for Cogitation<br>

Resides not in that man, that do's not thinke)<br>

My Wife is slipperie? If thou wilt confesse,<br>

Or else be impudently negatiue,<br>

To haue nor Eyes, nor Eares, nor Thought, then say<br>

My Wife's a Holy-Horse, deserues a Name<br>

As ranke as any Flax-Wench, that puts to<br>

Before her troth-plight: say't, and iustify't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09945">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. I would not be a stander-by, to heare<br>

My Soueraigne Mistresse clouded so, without<br>

My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,<br>

You neuer spoke what did become you lesse<br>

Then this; which to reiterate, were sin<br>

As deepe as that, though true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09946">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Is whispering nothing?<br>

Is leaning Cheeke to Cheeke? is meating Noses?<br>

Kissing with in-side Lip? stopping the Cariere<br>

Of Laughter, with a sigh? (a Note infallible<br>

Of breaking Honestie) horsing foot on foot?<br>

Skulking in corners? wishing Clocks more swift?<br>

Houres, Minutes? Noone, Mid-night? and all Eyes<br>

Blind with the Pin and Web, but theirs; theirs onely,<br>

That would vnseene be wicked? Is this nothing?<br>

Why then the World, and all that's in't, is nothing,<br>

The couering Skie is nothing, Bohemia nothing,<br>

My Wife is nothing, nor Nothing haue these Nothings,<br>

If this be nothing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09947">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Good my Lord, be cur'd<br>

Of this diseas'd Opinion, and betimes,<br>

For 'tis most dangerous<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09948"> Leo. Say it be, 'tis true</p><br>

<p id="id09949"> Cam. No, no, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id09950">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. It is: you lye, you lye:<br>

I say thou lyest Camillo, and I hate thee,<br>

Pronounce thee a grosse Lowt, a mindlesse Slaue,<br>

Or else a houering Temporizer, that<br>

Canst with thine eyes at once see good and euill,<br>

Inclining to them both: were my Wiues Liuer<br>

Infected (as her life) she would not liue<br>

The running of one Glasse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09951">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Who do's infect her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Why he that weares her like her Medull, hanging<br>

About his neck (Bohemia) who, if I<br>

Had Seruants true about me, that bare eyes<br>

To see alike mine Honor, as their Profits,<br>

(Their owne particular Thrifts) they would doe that<br>

Which should vndoe more doing: I, and thou<br>

His Cup-bearer, whom I from meaner forme<br>

Haue Bench'd, and rear'd to Worship, who may'st see<br>

Plainely, as Heauen sees Earth, and Earth sees Heauen,<br>

How I am gall'd, might'st be-spice a Cup,<br>

To giue mine Enemy a lasting Winke:<br>

Which Draught to me, were cordiall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09952">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Sir (my Lord)<br>

I could doe this, and that with no rash Potion,<br>

But with a lingring Dram, that should not worke<br>

Maliciously, like Poyson: But I cannot<br>

Beleeue this Crack to be in my dread Mistresse<br>

(So soueraignely being Honorable.)<br>

I haue lou'd thee,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Make that thy question, and goe rot:<br>

Do'st thinke I am so muddy, so vnsetled,<br>

To appoint my selfe in this vexation?<br>

Sully the puritie and whitenesse of my Sheetes<br>

(Which to preserue, is Sleepe; which being spotted,<br>

Is Goades, Thornes, Nettles, Tayles of Waspes)<br>

Giue scandall to the blood o'th' Prince, my Sonne,<br>

(Who I doe thinke is mine, and loue as mine)<br>

Without ripe mouing to't? Would I doe this?<br>

Could man so blench?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. I must beleeue you (Sir)<br>

I doe, and will fetch off Bohemia for't:<br>

Prouided, that when hee's remou'd, your Highnesse<br>

Will take againe your Queene, as yours at first,<br>

Euen for your Sonnes sake, and thereby for sealing<br>

The Iniurie of Tongues, in Courts and Kingdomes<br>

Knowne, and ally'd to yours<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09953">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Thou do'st aduise me,<br>

Euen so as I mine owne course haue set downe:<br>

Ile giue no blemish to her Honor, none<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09954">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. My Lord,<br>

Goe then; and with a countenance as cleare<br>

As Friendship weares at Feasts, keepe with Bohemia,<br>

And with your Queene: I am his Cup-bearer,<br>

If from me he haue wholesome Beueridge,<br>

Account me not your Seruant<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09955">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. This is all:<br>

Do't, and thou hast the one halfe of my heart;<br>

Do't not, thou splitt'st thine owne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09956"> Cam. Ile do't, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id09957"> Leo. I wil seeme friendly, as thou hast aduis'd me.</p><br>

<p id="id09958">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id09959">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. O miserable Lady. But for me,<br>

What case stand I in? I must be the poysoner<br>

Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do't,<br>

Is the obedience to a Master; one,<br>

Who in Rebellion with himselfe, will haue<br>

All that are his, so too. To doe this deed,<br>

Promotion followes: If I could find example<br>

Of thousand's that had struck anoynted Kings,<br>

And flourish'd after, Il'd not do't: But since<br>

Nor Brasse, nor Stone, nor Parchment beares not one,<br>

Let Villanie it selfe forswear't. I must<br>

Forsake the Court: to do't, or no, is certaine<br>

To me a breake-neck. Happy Starre raigne now,<br>

Here comes Bohemia.<br>

Enter Polixenes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09960">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. This is strange: Me thinkes<br>

My fauor here begins to warpe. Not speake?<br>

Good day Camillo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09961"> Cam. Hayle most Royall Sir</p><br>

<p id="id09962">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. What is the Newes i'th' Court?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. None rare (my Lord.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. The King hath on him such a countenance,<br>

As he had lost some Prouince, and a Region<br>

Lou'd, as he loues himselfe: euen now I met him<br>

With customarie complement, when hee<br>

Wafting his eyes to th' contrary, and falling<br>

A Lippe of much contempt, speedes from me, and<br>

So leaues me, to consider what is breeding,<br>

That changes thus his Manners<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09963">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. I dare not know (my Lord.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. How, dare not? doe not? doe you know, and dare not?<br>

Be intelligent to me, 'tis thereabouts:<br>

For to your selfe, what you doe know, you must,<br>

And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,<br>

Your chang'd complexions are to me a Mirror,<br>

Which shewes me mine chang'd too: for I must be<br>

A partie in this alteration, finding<br>

My selfe thus alter'd with't<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09964">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. There is a sicknesse<br>

Which puts some of vs in distemper, but<br>

I cannot name the Disease, and it is caught<br>

Of you, that yet are well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09965">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. How caught of me?<br>

Make me not sighted like the Basilisque.<br>

I haue look'd on thousands, who haue sped the better<br>

By my regard, but kill'd none so: Camillo,<br>

As you are certainely a Gentleman, thereto<br>

Clerke-like experienc'd, which no lesse adornes<br>

Our Gentry, then our Parents Noble Names,<br>

In whose successe we are gentle: I beseech you,<br>

If you know ought which do's behoue my knowledge,<br>

Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not<br>

In ignorant concealement<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09966"> Cam. I may not answere</p><br>

<p id="id09967">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. A Sicknesse caught of me, and yet I well?<br>

I must be answer'd. Do'st thou heare Camillo,<br>

I coniure thee, by all the parts of man,<br>

Which Honor do's acknowledge, whereof the least<br>

Is not this Suit of mine, that thou declare<br>

What incidencie thou do'st ghesse of harme<br>

Is creeping toward me; how farre off, how neere,<br>

Which way to be preuented, if to be:<br>

If not, how best to beare it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09968">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Sir, I will tell you,<br>

Since I am charg'd in Honor, and by him<br>

That I thinke Honorable: therefore marke my counsaile,<br>

Which must be eu'n as swiftly followed, as<br>

I meane to vtter it; or both your selfe, and me,<br>

Cry lost, and so good night<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09969"> Pol. On, good Camillo</p><br>

<p id="id09970"> Cam. I am appointed him to murther you</p><br>

<p id="id09971">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. By whom, Camillo?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. By the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09972">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. For what?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. He thinkes, nay with all confidence he sweares,<br>

As he had seen't, or beene an Instrument<br>

To vice you to't, that you haue toucht his Queene<br>

Forbiddenly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09973">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. Oh then, my best blood turne<br>

To an infected Gelly, and my Name<br>

Be yoak'd with his, that did betray the Best:<br>

Turne then my freshest Reputation to<br>

A sauour, that may strike the dullest Nosthrill<br>

Where I arriue, and my approch be shun'd,<br>

Nay hated too, worse then the great'st Infection<br>

That ere was heard, or read<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09974">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Sweare his thought ouer<br>

By each particular Starre in Heauen, and<br>

By all their Influences; you may as well<br>

Forbid the Sea for to obey the Moone,<br>

As (or by Oath) remoue, or (Counsaile) shake<br>

The Fabrick of his Folly, whose foundation<br>

Is pyl'd vpon his Faith, and will continue<br>

The standing of his Body<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09975">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. How should this grow?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to<br>

Auoid what's growne, then question how 'tis borne.<br>

If therefore you dare trust my honestie,<br>

That lyes enclosed in this Trunke, which you<br>

Shall beare along impawnd, away to Night,<br>

Your Followers I will whisper to the Businesse,<br>

And will by twoes, and threes, at seuerall Posternes,<br>

Cleare them o'th' Citie: For my selfe, Ile put<br>

My fortunes to your seruice (which are here<br>

By this discouerie lost.) Be not vncertaine,<br>

For by the honor of my Parents, I<br>

Haue vttred Truth: which if you seeke to proue,<br>

I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer,<br>

Then one condemnd by the Kings owne mouth:<br>

Thereon his Execution sworne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09976">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. I doe beleeue thee:<br>

I saw his heart in's face. Giue me thy hand,<br>

Be Pilot to me, and thy places shall<br>

Still neighbour mine. My Ships are ready, and<br>

My people did expect my hence departure<br>

Two dayes agoe. This Iealousie<br>

Is for a precious Creature: as shee's rare,<br>

Must it be great; and, as his Person's mightie,<br>

Must it be violent: and, as he do's conceiue,<br>

He is dishonor'd by a man, which euer<br>

Profess'd to him: why his Reuenges must<br>

In that be made more bitter. Feare ore-shades me:<br>

Good Expedition be my friend, and comfort<br>

The gracious Queene, part of his Theame; but nothing<br>

Of his ill-ta'ne suspition. Come Camillo,<br>

I will respect thee as a Father, if<br>

Thou bear'st my life off, hence: Let vs auoid<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09977">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. It is in mine authoritie to command<br>

The Keyes of all the Posternes: Please your Highnesse<br>

To take the vrgent houre. Come Sir, away.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09978">Exeunt.</p><br>

Too much haire there, but in a Cemicircle,<br>

Or a halfe-Moone, made with a Pen.)<br>

In being so blest? There may be in the Cup<br>

A Spider steep'd, and one may drinke; depart,<br>

And yet partake no venome: (for his knowledge<br>

Is not infected) but if one present<br>

Th' abhor'd Ingredient to his eye, make knowne<br>

How he hath drunke, he cracks his gorge, his sides<br>

With violent Hefts: I haue drunke, and seene the Spider.<br>

Camillo was his helpe in this, his Pandar:<br>

There is a Plot against my Life, my Crowne;<br>

All's true that is mistrusted: that false Villaine,<br>

Whom I employ'd, was pre-employ'd by him:<br>

He ha's discouer'd my Designe, and I<br>

Remaine a pinch'd Thing; yea, a very Trick<br>

For them to play at will: how came the Posternes<br>

So easily open?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord. By his great authority,<br>

Which often hath no lesse preuail'd, then so,<br>

On your command<br>

Giue me the Boy, I am glad you did not nurse him:<br>

Though he do's beare some signes of me, yet you<br>

Haue too much blood in him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id09997">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. What is this? Sport?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Beare the Boy hence, he shall not come about her,<br>

Away with him, and let her sport her selfe<br>

With that shee's big-with, for 'tis Polixenes<br>

Ha's made thee swell thus<br>

<p id="id09998">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. But Il'd say he had not;<br>

And Ile be sworne you would beleeue my saying,<br>

How e're you leane to th' Nay-ward<br>

Looke on her, marke her well: be but about<br>

To say she is a goodly Lady, and<br>

The iustice of your hearts will thereto adde<br>

'Tis pitty shee's not honest: Honorable;<br>

Prayse her but for this her without-dore-Forme,<br>

When you haue said shee's goodly, come betweene,<br>

Ere you can say shee's honest: But be't knowne<br>

He were as much more Villaine: you (my Lord)<br>

Doe but mistake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10001">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. You haue mistooke (my Lady)<br>

Polixenes for Leontes: O thou Thing,<br>

(Which Ile not call a Creature of thy place,<br>

Least Barbarisme (making me the precedent)<br>

Should a like Language vse to all degrees,<br>

And mannerly distinguishment leaue out,<br>

Betwixt the Prince and Begger:) I haue said<br>

Shee's an Adultresse, I haue said with whom:<br>

More; shee's a Traytor, and Camillo is<br>

A Federarie with her, and one that knowes<br>

What she should shame to know her selfe,<br>

But with her most vild Principall: that shee's<br>

A Bed-swaruer, euen as bad as those<br>

That Vulgars giue bold'st Titles; I, and priuy<br>

To this their late escape<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10002">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. No (by my life)<br>

Priuy to none of this: how will this grieue you,<br>

When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that<br>

You thus haue publish'd me? Gentle my Lord,<br>

You scarce can right me throughly, then, to say<br>

You did mistake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10003">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. No: if I mistake<br>

In those Foundations which I build vpon,<br>

The Centre is not bigge enough to beare<br>

A Schoole-Boyes Top. Away with her, to Prison:<br>

He who shall speake for her, is a farre-off guiltie,<br>

But that he speakes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10004">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. There's some ill Planet raignes:<br>

I must be patient, till the Heauens looke<br>

With an aspect more fauorable. Good my Lords,<br>

I am not prone to weeping (as our Sex<br>

Commonly are) the want of which vaine dew<br>

Perchance shall dry your pitties: but I haue<br>

That honorable Griefe lodg'd here, which burnes<br>

Worse then Teares drowne: 'beseech you all (my Lords)<br>

With thoughts so qualified, as your Charities<br>

Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<br>

The Kings will be perform'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10005">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Shall I be heard?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Who is't that goes with me? 'beseech your Highnes<br>

My Women may be with me, for you see<br>

My plight requires it. Doe not weepe (good Fooles)<br>

As I come out; this Action I now goe on,<br>

Is for my better grace. Adieu (my Lord)<br>

I neuer wish'd to see you sorry, now<br>

You are abus'd, and by some putter on,<br>

That will be damn'd for't: would I knew the Villaine,<br>

I would Land-damne him: be she honor-flaw'd,<br>

I haue three daughters: the eldest is eleuen;<br>

The second, and the third, nine: and some fiue:<br>

If this proue true, they'l pay for't. By mine Honor<br>

Ile gell'd em all: fourteene they shall not see<br>

To bring false generations: they are co-heyres,<br>

And I had rather glib my selfe, then they<br>

Should not produce faire issue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10013">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Cease, no more:<br>

You smell this businesse with a sence as cold<br>

As is a dead-mans nose: but I do see't, and feel't,<br>

As you feele doing thus: and see withall<br>

The Instruments that feele<br>

We neede no graue to burie honesty,<br>

There's not a graine of it, the face to sweeten<br>

Of the whole dungy-earth<br>

<p id="id10015">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. What? lacke I credit?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord. I had rather you did lacke then I (my Lord)<br>

Vpon this ground: and more it would content me<br>

To haue her Honor true, then your suspition<br>

Be blam'd for't how you might<br>

<p id="id10016">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Why what neede we<br>

Commune with you of this? but rather follow<br>

Our forcefull instigation? Our prerogatiue<br>

Cals not your Counsailes, but our naturall goodnesse<br>

Imparts this: which, if you, or stupified,<br>

Or seeming so, in skill, cannot, or will not<br>

Rellish a truth, like vs: informe your selues,<br>

We neede no more of your aduice: the matter,<br>

The losse, the gaine, the ord'ring on't,<br>

Is all properly ours<br>

You had onely in your silent iudgement tride it,<br>

Without more ouerture<br>

<p id="id10018">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. How could that be?<br>

Either thou art most ignorant by age,<br>

Or thou wer't borne a foole: Camillo's flight<br>

Added to their Familiarity<br>

(Which was as grosse, as euer touch'd coniecture,<br>

That lack'd sight onely, nought for approbation<br>

But onely seeing, all other circumstances<br>

Made vp to'th deed) doth push-on this proceeding.<br>

Yet, for a greater confirmation<br>

(For in an Acte of this importance, 'twere<br>

Most pitteous to be wilde) I haue dispatch'd in post,<br>

To sacred Delphos, to Appollo's Temple,<br>

Cleomines and Dion, whom you know<br>

They will bring all, whose spirituall counsaile had<br>

Much comfort in't: Sayes, my poore prisoner,<br>

I am innocent as you,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pau. I dare be sworne:<br>

These dangerous, vnsafe Lunes i'th' King, beshrew them:<br>

He must be told on't, and he shall: the office<br>

Becomes a woman best. Ile take't vpon me,<br>

If I proue hony-mouth'd, let my tongue blister.<br>

Commend my best obedience to the Queene,<br>

So meete for this great errand; please your Ladiship<br>

To visit the next roome, Ile presently<br>

Acquaint the Queene of your most noble offer,<br>

Hauing no warrant<br>

(As this world goes) to passe for honest:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Traitors;<br>

Will you not push her out? Giue her the Bastard,<br>

Thou dotard, thou art woman-tyr'd: vnroosted<br>

The sacred Honor of himselfe, his Queenes,<br>

His hopefull Sonnes, his Babes, betrayes to Slander,<br>

Whose sting is sharper then the Swords; and will not<br>

(For as the case now stands, it is a Curse<br>

He cannot be compell'd too't) once remoue<br>

The Root of his Opinion, which is rotten,<br>

As euer Oake, or Stone was sound<br>

Of boundlesse tongue, who late hath beat her Husband,<br>

And now bayts me: This Brat is none of mine,<br>

It is the Issue of Polixenes.<br>

Hence with it, and together with the Dam,<br>

Commit them to the fire<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10065">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. It is yours:<br>

And might we lay th' old Prouerb to your charge,<br>

So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold (my Lords)<br>

Although the Print be little, the whole Matter<br>

And Coppy of the Father: (Eye, Nose, Lippe,<br>

The trick of's Frowne, his Fore-head, nay, the Valley,<br>

The pretty dimples of his Chin, and Cheeke; his Smiles:<br>

The very Mold, and frame of Hand, Nayle, Finger.)<br>

So like to him that got it, if thou hast<br>

The ordering of the Mind too, 'mongst all Colours<br>

No Yellow in't, least she suspect, as he do's,<br>

Her Children, not her Husbands<br>

Then your owne weake-hindg'd Fancy) something sauors<br>

Of Tyrannie, and will ignoble make you,<br>

Yea, scandalous to the World<br>

You that are thus so tender o're his Follyes,<br>

My Child? away with't? euen thou, that hast<br>

A heart so tender o're it, take it hence,<br>

And see it instantly consum'd with fire.<br>

Euen thou, and none but thou. Take it vp straight:<br>

Within this houre bring me word 'tis done,<br>

With what thou else call'st thine: if thou refuse,<br>

And wilt encounter with my Wrath, say so;<br>

The Bastard-braynes with these my proper hands<br>

Shall I liue on, to see this Bastard kneele,<br>

And call me Father? better burne it now,<br>

Then curse it then. But be it: let it liue.<br>

It shall not neyther. You Sir, come you hither:<br>

You that haue beene so tenderly officious<br>

With Lady Margerie, your Mid-wife there,<br>

To saue this Bastards life; for 'tis a Bastard,<br>

So sure as this Beard's gray. What will you aduenture,<br>

To saue this Brats life?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Antig. Any thing (my Lord)<br>

That my abilitie may vndergoe,<br>

Of any point in't, shall not onely be<br>

Death to thy selfe, but to thy lewd-tongu'd Wife,<br>

(Whom for this time we pardon) We enioyne thee,<br>

As thou art Liege-man to vs, that thou carry<br>

This female Bastard hence, and that thou beare it<br>

To some remote and desart place, quite out<br>

Of our Dominions; and that there thou leaue it<br>

(Without more mercy) to it owne protection,<br>

And fauour of the Climate: as by strange fortune<br>

It came to vs, I doe in Iustice charge thee,<br>

On thy Soules perill, and thy Bodyes torture,<br>

That thou commend it strangely to some place,<br>

Where Chance may nurse, or end it: take it vp<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10082">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antig. I sweare to doe this: though a present death<br>

Had beene more mercifull. Come on (poore Babe)<br>

Some powerfull Spirit instruct the Kytes and Rauens<br>

To be thy Nurses. Wolues and Beares, they say,<br>

(Casting their sauagenesse aside) haue done<br>

Like offices of Pitty. Sir, be prosperous<br>

and conspiring with Camillo to take away the Life of our
Soueraigne
Lord the King, thy Royall Husband: the pretence whereof
being by circumstances partly layd open, thou (Hermione) contrary
to the Faith and Allegeance of a true Subiect, didst counsaile
and ayde them, for their better safetie, to flye away by
Night</p><br>

<p id="id10102">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Since what I am to say, must be but that<br>

Which contradicts my Accusation, and<br>

The testimonie on my part, no other<br>

But what comes from my selfe, it shall scarce boot me<br>

To say, Not guiltie: mine Integritie<br>

Being counted Falsehood, shall (as I expresse it)<br>

Be so receiu'd. But thus, if Powres Diuine<br>

Behold our humane Actions (as they doe)<br>

I doubt not then, but Innocence shall make<br>

False Accusation blush, and Tyrannie<br>

Tremble at Patience. You (my Lord) best know<br>

(Whom least will seeme to doe so) my past life<br>

Hath beene as continent, as chaste, as true,<br>

As I am now vnhappy; which is more<br>

Then Historie can patterne, though deuis'd,<br>

And play'd, to take Spectators. For behold me,<br>

A Fellow of the Royall Bed, which owe<br>

A Moitie of the Throne: a great Kings Daughter,<br>

The Mother to a hopefull Prince, here standing<br>

To prate and talke for Life, and Honor, fore<br>

Who please to come, and heare. For Life, I prize it<br>

As I weigh Griefe (which I would spare:) For Honor,<br>

'Tis a deriuatiue from me to mine,<br>

And onely that I stand for. I appeale<br>

To your owne Conscience (Sir) before Polixenes<br>

Came to your Court, how I was in your grace,<br>

How merited to be so: Since he came,<br>

With what encounter so vncurrant, I<br>

Haue strayn'd t' appeare thus; if one iot beyond<br>

The bound of Honor, or in act, or will<br>

That way enclining, hardned be the hearts<br>

Lesse Impudence to gaine-say what they did,<br>

<p id="id10105"> Leo. You will not owne it</p><br>

<p id="id10106">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. More then Mistresse of,<br>

Which comes to me in name of Fault, I must not<br>

At all acknowledge. For Polixenes<br>

(With whom I am accus'd) I doe confesse<br>

I lou'd him, as in Honor he requir'd:<br>

With such a kind of Loue, as might become<br>

A Lady like me; with a Loue, euen such,<br>

So, and no other, as your selfe commanded:<br>

Which, not to haue done, I thinke had been in me<br>

Both Disobedience, and Ingratitude<br>

To you, and toward your Friend, whose Loue had spoke,<br>

Euen since it could speake, from an Infant, freely,<br>

That it was yours. Now for Conspiracie,<br>

I know not how it tastes, though it be dish'd<br>

For me to try how: All I know of it,<br>

Is, that Camillo was an honest man;<br>

And why he left your Court, the Gods themselues<br>

(Wotting no more then I) are ignorant<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. You knew of his departure, as you know<br>

You speake a Language that I vnderstand not:<br>

My Life stands in the leuell of your Dreames,<br>

Which Ile lay downe<br>

<p id="id10109">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Your Actions are my Dreames.<br>

You had a Bastard by Polixenes,<br>

And I but dream'd it: As you were past all shame,<br>

(Those of your Fact are so) so past all truth;<br>

Which to deny, concernes more then auailes: for as<br>

Thy Brat hath been cast out, like to it selfe,<br>

No Father owning it (which is indeed<br>

More criminall in thee, then it) so thou<br>

Shalt feele our Iustice; in whose easiest passage,<br>

Looke for no lesse then death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10110">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. Sir, spare your Threats:<br>

The Bugge which you would fright me with, I seeke:<br>

To me can Life be no commoditie;<br>

The crowne and comfort of my Life (your Fauor)<br>

I doe giue lost, for I doe feele it gone,<br>

But know not how it went. My second Ioy,<br>

And first Fruits of my body, from his presence<br>

I am bar'd, like one infectious. My third comfort<br>

(Star'd most vnluckily) is from my breast<br>

(The innocent milke in it most innocent mouth)<br>

Hal'd out to murther. My selfe on euery Post<br>

Proclaym'd a Strumpet: With immodest hatred<br>

The Child-bed priuiledge deny'd, which longs<br>

To Women of all fashion. Lastly, hurried<br>

Here, to this place, i'th' open ayre, before<br>

I haue got strength of limit. Now (my Liege)<br>

Tell me what blessings I haue here aliue,<br>

That I should feare to die? Therefore proceed:<br>

But yet heare this: mistake me not: no Life,<br>

(I prize it not a straw) but for mine Honor,<br>

Which I would free: if I shall be condemn'd<br>

Vpon surmizes (all proofes sleeping else,<br>

But what your Iealousies awake) I tell you<br>

'Tis Rigor, and not Law. Your Honors all,<br>

I doe referre me to the Oracle:<br>

Apollo be my Iudge<br>

<p id="id10111">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord. This your request<br>

Is altogether iust: therefore bring forth<br>

(And in Apollo's Name) his Oracle<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10112">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her. The Emperor of Russia was my Father.<br>

Oh that he were aliue, and here beholding<br>

His Daughters Tryall: that he did but see<br>

The flatnesse of my miserie; yet with eyes<br>

Of Pitty, not Reuenge<br>

Of great Apollo's Priest; and that since then,<br>

'Beseech you tenderly apply to her<br>

Some remedies for life. Apollo pardon<br>

My great prophanenesse 'gainst thine Oracle.<br>

Ile reconcile me to Polixenes,<br>

New woe my Queene, recall the good Camillo<br>

(Whom I proclaime a man of Truth, of Mercy:)<br>

For being transported by my Iealousies<br>

To bloody thoughts, and to reuenge, I chose<br>

Camillo for the minister, to poyson<br>

My friend Polixenes: which had been done,<br>

But that the good mind of Camillo tardied<br>

My swift command: though I with Death, and with<br>

Reward, did threaten and encourage him,<br>

Not doing it, and being done: he (most humane,<br>

And fill'd with Honor) to my Kingly Guest<br>

Vnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here<br>

(Which you knew great) and to the hazard<br>

Of all Incertainties, himselfe commended,<br>

No richer then his Honor: How he glisters<br>

Through my Rust? and how his Pietie<br>

Do's my deeds make the blacker?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. Woe the while:<br>

O cut my Lace, least my heart (cracking it)<br>

Breake too<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10125">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord. What fit is this? good Lady?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. What studied torments (Tyrant) hast for me?<br>

What Wheeles? Racks? Fires? What flaying? boyling?<br>

In Leads, or Oyles? What old, or newer Torture<br>

Must I receiue? whose euery word deserues<br>

To taste of thy most worst. Thy Tyranny<br>

(Together working with thy Iealousies,<br>

Fancies too weake for Boyes, too greene and idle<br>

For Girles of Nine) O thinke what they haue done,<br>

And then run mad indeed: starke-mad: for all<br>

Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.<br>

That thou betrayed'st Polixenes, 'twas nothing,<br>

(That did but shew thee, of a Foole, inconstant,<br>

And damnable ingratefull:) Nor was't much.<br>

Thou would'st haue poyson'd good Camillo's Honor,<br>

To haue him kill a King: poore Trespasses,<br>

More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon<br>

The casting forth to Crowes, thy Baby-daughter,<br>

To be or none, or little; though a Deuill<br>

Would haue shed water out of fire, ere don't;<br>

Nor is't directly layd to thee, the death<br>

Of the young Prince, whose honorable thoughts<br>

(Thoughts high for one so tender) cleft the heart<br>

That could conceiue a grosse and foolish Sire<br>

Blemish'd his gracious Dam: this is not, no,<br>

Layd to thy answere: but the last: O Lords,<br>

When I haue said, cry woe: the Queene, the Queene,<br>

The sweet'st, deer'st creature's dead: &amp; vengeance for't<br>

Not drop'd downe yet<br>

Heate outwardly, or breath within, Ile serue you<br>

As I would do the Gods. But, O thou Tyrant,<br>

Do not repent these things, for they are heauier<br>

Then all thy woes can stirre: therefore betake thee<br>

To nothing but dispaire. A thousand knees,<br>

Ten thousand yeares together, naked, fasting,<br>

Vpon a barren Mountaine, and still Winter<br>

In storme perpetuall, could not moue the Gods<br>

How ere the businesse goes, you haue made fault<br>

To th' Noble heart. What's gone, and what's past helpe<br>

Should be past greefe: Do not receiue affliction<br>

At my petition; I beseech you, rather<br>

Let me be punish'd, that haue minded you<br>

Of what you should forget. Now (good my Liege)<br>

The loue I bore your Queene (Lo, foole againe)<br>

Ile speake of her no more, nor of your Children:<br>

Ile not remember you of my owne Lord,<br>

(Who is lost too:) take your patience to you,<br>

And Ile say nothing<br>

<p id="id10131">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Thou didst speake but well,<br>

When most the truth: which I receyue much better,<br>

Then to be pittied of thee. Prethee bring me<br>

To the dead bodies of my Queene, and Sonne,<br>

One graue shall be for both: Vpon them shall<br>

The causes of their death appeare (vnto<br>

Our shame perpetuall) once a day, Ile visit<br>

The Chappell where they lye, and teares shed there<br>

Shall be my recreation. So long as Nature<br>

Put on thee, by my Lord, thou ne're shalt see<br>

Thy Wife Paulina more: and so, with shriekes<br>

She melted into Ayre. Affrighted much,<br>

I did in time collect my selfe, and thought<br>

This was so, and no slumber: Dreames, are toyes,<br>

Yet for this once, yea superstitiously,<br>

I will be squar'd by this. I do beleeue<br>

Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that<br>

Apollo would (this being indeede the issue<br>

Of King Polixenes) it should heere be laide<br>

(Either for life, or death) vpon the earth<br>

Of it's right Father. Blossome, speed thee well,<br>

There lye, and there thy charracter: there these,<br>

Which may if Fortune please, both breed thee (pretty)<br>

And still rest thine. The storme beginnes, poore wretch,<br>

That for thy mothers fault, art thus expos'd<br>

To losse, and what may follow. Weepe I cannot,<br>

But my heart bleedes: and most accurst am I<br>

To be by oath enioyn'd to this. Farewell,<br>

The day frownes more and more: thou'rt like to haue<br>

A lullabie too rough: I neuer saw<br>

The heauens so dim, by day. A sauage clamor?<br>

Well may I get a-boord: This is the Chace,<br>

I am gone for euer.<br>

talke on, when thou art dead and rotten, come hither:
what ayl'st thou, man?
 Clo. I haue seene two such sights, by Sea &amp; by Land:
but I am not to say it is a Sea, for it is now the skie, betwixt
the Firmament and it, you cannot thrust a bodkins
point</p><br>

<p id="id10147"> Shep. Why boy, how is it?
 Clo. I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes vp the shore, but that's not to the point:
Oh, the most pitteous cry of the poore soules, sometimes
to see 'em, and not to see 'em: Now the Shippe boaring
the Moone with her maine Mast, and anon swallowed
with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a Corke into a hogshead.
And then for the Land-seruice, to see how the
Beare tore out his shoulder-bone, how he cride to mee
for helpe, and said his name was Antigonus, a Nobleman:
But to make an end of the Ship, to see how the Sea flapdragon'd
it: but first, how the poore soules roared, and
the sea mock'd them: and how the poore Gentleman roared,
and the Beare mock'd him, both roaring lowder
then the sea, or weather</p><br>

<p id="id10148">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. Name of mercy, when was this boy?<br>

Looke thee, a bearing-cloath for a Squires childe: looke
thee heere, take vp, take vp (Boy:) open't: so, let's see, it
was told me I should be rich by the Fairies. This is some
Changeling: open't: what's within, boy?

<p id="id10163"> Pol. I pray thee (good Camillo) be no more importunate:
'tis a sicknesse denying thee any thing: a death to
grant this</p><br>

<p id="id10164"> Cam. It is fifteene yeeres since I saw my Countrey:
though I haue (for the most part) bin ayred abroad, I desire
to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King
(my Master) hath sent for me, to whose feeling sorrowes
I might be some allay, or I oreweene to thinke so) which
is another spurre to my departure</p><br>

<p id="id10165"> Pol. As thou lou'st me (Camillo) wipe not out the rest
of thy seruices, by leauing me now: the neede I haue of
thee, thine owne goodnesse hath made: better not to
haue had thee, then thus to want thee, thou hauing made
me Businesses, (which none (without thee) can sufficiently
manage) must either stay to execute them thy selfe,
or take away with thee the very seruices thou hast done:
which if I haue not enough considered (as too much I
cannot) to bee more thankefull to thee, shall bee my studie,
and my profite therein, the heaping friendshippes.
Of that fatall Countrey Sicillia, prethee speake no more,
whose very naming, punnishes me with the remembrance
of that penitent (as thou calst him) and reconciled King
my brother, whose losse of his most precious Queene &amp;
Children, are euen now to be a-fresh lamented. Say to
me, when saw'st thou the Prince Florizell my son? Kings
are no lesse vnhappy, their issue, not being gracious, then
they are in loosing them, when they haue approued their
Vertues</p><br>

<p id="id10166"> Cam. Sir, it is three dayes since I saw the Prince: what
his happier affayres may be, are to me vnknowne: but I
haue (missingly) noted, he is of late much retyred from
Court, and is lesse frequent to his Princely exercises then
formerly he hath appeared</p><br>

<p id="id10167"> Pol. I haue considered so much (Camillo) and with
some care, so farre, that I haue eyes vnder my seruice,
which looke vpon his remouednesse: from whom I haue
this Intelligence, that he is seldome from the house of a
most homely shepheard: a man (they say) that from very
nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors,
is growne into an vnspeakable estate</p><br>

<p id="id10168"> Cam. I haue heard (sir) of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended
more, then can be thought to begin from such a cottage
 Pol. That's likewise part of my Intelligence: but (I
feare) the Angle that pluckes our sonne thither. Thou
shalt accompany vs to the place, where we will (not appearing
what we are) haue some question with the shepheard;
from whose simplicity, I thinke it not vneasie to
get the cause of my sonnes resort thether. 'Prethe be my

<p id="id10219">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. Say there be:<br>

Yet Nature is made better by no meane,<br>

But Nature makes that Meane: so ouer that Art,<br>

(Which you say addes to Nature) is an Art<br>

That Nature makes: you see (sweet Maid) we marry<br>

A gentler Sien, to the wildest Stocke,<br>

And make conceyue a barke of baser kinde<br>

By bud of Nobler race. This is an Art<br>

Which do's mend Nature: change it rather, but<br>

The Art it selfe, is Nature<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10220"> Perd. So it is</p><br>

The Dible in earth, to set one slip of them:<br>

No more then were I painted, I would wish<br>

This youth should say 'twer well: and onely therefore<br>

Desire to breed by me. Here's flowres for you:<br>

Hot Lauender, Mints, Sauory, Mariorum,<br>

The Mary-gold, that goes to bed with' Sun,<br>

And with him rises, weeping: These are flowres<br>

Of middle summer, and I thinke they are giuen<br>

To men of middle age. Y'are very welcome<br>
</p><br>

And onely liue by gazing<br>

<p id="id10224">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. Out alas:<br>

You'ld be so leane, that blasts of Ianuary<br>

Would blow you through and through. Now (my fairst Friend,<br>

I would I had some Flowres o'th Spring, that might<br>

Become your time of day: and yours, and yours,<br>

That weare vpon your Virgin-branches yet<br>

Your Maiden-heads growing: O Proserpina,<br>

For the Flowres now, that (frighted) thou let'st fall<br>

From Dysses Waggon: Daffadils,<br>

That come before the Swallow dares, and take<br>

The windes of March with beauty: Violets (dim,<br>

But sweeter then the lids of Iuno's eyes,<br>

Or Cytherea's breath) pale Prime-roses,<br>

That dye vnmarried, ere they can behold<br>

Bright Phoebus in his strength (a Maladie<br>

Most incident to Maids:) bold Oxlips, and<br>

The Crowne Imperiall: Lillies of all kinds,<br>

(The Flowre-de-Luce being one.) O, these I lacke,<br>

To make you Garlands of) and my sweet friend,<br>

To strew him o're, and ore<br>

<p id="id10225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. What? like a Coarse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. No, like a banke, for Loue to lye, and play on:<br>

Not like a Coarse: or if: not to be buried,<br>

But quicke, and in mine armes. Come, take your flours,<br>

Me thinkes I play as I haue seene them do<br>

In Whitson-Pastorals: Sure this Robe of mine<br>

Do's change my disposition:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. What you do,<br>

Still betters what is done. When you speake (Sweet)<br>

I'ld haue you do it euer: When you sing,<br>

I'ld haue you buy, and sell so: so giue Almes,<br>

Pray so: and for the ord'ring your Affayres,<br>

To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you<br>

A waue o'th Sea, that you might euer do<br>

Nothing but that: moue still, still so:<br>

And owne no other Function. Each your doing,<br>

(So singular, in each particular)<br>

Crownes what you are doing, in the present deeds,<br>

That all your Actes, are Queenes<br>

<p id="id10226">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. O Doricles,<br>

Your praises are too large: but that your youth<br>

And the true blood which peepes fairely through't,<br>

Do plainly giue you out an vnstain'd Shepherd<br>

With wisedome, I might feare (my Doricles)<br>

You woo'd me the false way<br>

<p id="id10227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. I thinke you haue<br>

As little skill to feare, as I haue purpose<br>

To put you to't. But come, our dance I pray,<br>

Your hand (my Perdita:) so Turtles paire<br>

That neuer meane to part<br>

<p id="id10229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol. This is the prettiest Low-borne Lasse, that euer<br>

Ran on the greene-sord: Nothing she do's, or seemes<br>

But smackes of something greater then her selfe,<br>

Too Noble for this place<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10230">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. He tels her something<br>

That makes her blood looke on't: Good sooth she is<br>

Which dances with your daughter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. They call him Doricles, and boasts himselfe<br>

To haue a worthy Feeding; but I haue it<br>

Vpon his owne report, and I beleeue it:<br>

He lookes like sooth: he sayes he loues my daughter,<br>

I thinke so too; for neuer gaz'd the Moone<br>

Vpon the water, as hee'l stand and reade<br>

As 'twere my daughters eyes: and to be plaine,<br>

That should be silent: If yong Doricles<br>

Do light vpon her, she shall bring him that<br>

Which he not dreames of.<br>

Enter Seruant.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10239"> Ser. O Master: if you did but heare the Pedler at the
doore, you would neuer dance againe after a Tabor and
Pipe: no, the Bag-pipe could not moue you: hee singes
seuerall Tunes, faster then you'l tell money: hee vtters
them as he had eaten ballads, and all mens eares grew to
his Tunes</p><br>

<p id="id10240"> Clo. He could neuer come better: hee shall come in:
I loue a ballad but euen too well, if it be dolefull matter
merrily set downe: or a very pleasant thing indeede, and
sung lamentably</p><br>

<p id="id10241"> Ser. He hath songs for man, or woman, of all sizes:
No Milliner can so fit his customers with Gloues: he has
the prettiest Loue-songs for Maids, so without bawdrie
(which is strange,) with such delicate burthens of Dildo's
and Fadings: Iump-her, and thump-her; and where
some stretch-mouth'd Rascall, would (as it were) meane
mischeefe, and breake a fowle gap into the Matter, hee
makes the maid to answere, Whoop, doe me no harme good
man: put's him off, slights him, with Whoop, doe mee no
harme good man</p><br>

<p id="id10242"> Pol. This is a braue fellow</p><br>

<p id="id10243"> Clo. Beleeue mee, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow, has he any vnbraided Wares?
 Ser. Hee hath Ribbons of all the colours i'th Rainebow;
Points, more then all the Lawyers in Bohemia, can
learnedly handle, though they come to him by th' grosse:
Inckles, Caddysses, Cambrickes, Lawnes: why he sings
em ouer, as they were Gods, or Goddesses: you would
thinke a Smocke were a shee-Angell, he so chauntes to
the sleeue-hand, and the worke about the square on't</p><br>

<p id="id10244"> Clo. Pre'thee bring him in, and let him approach singing</p><br>

<p id="id10245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. Forewarne him, that he vse no scurrilous words<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. I, good brother, or go about to thinke.<br>

take no money of me, but being enthrall'd as I am, it will
also be the bondage of certaine Ribbons and Gloues</p><br>

he has paid you more, which will shame you to giue him

<p id="id10252"> Clo. Is there no manners left among maids? Will they
weare their plackets, where they should bear their faces?
Is there not milking-time? When you are going to bed?
Or kill-hole? To whistle of these secrets, but you must
be tittle-tatling before all our guests? 'Tis well they are
whispring: clamor your tongues, and not a word more</p><br>

<p id="id10253">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mop. I haue done; Come you promis'd me a tawdrylace,<br>

and a paire of sweet Gloues<br>

<p id="id10254">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Haue I not told thee how I was cozen'd by the<br>

way, and lost all my money<br>

<p id="id10255">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. And indeed Sir, there are Cozeners abroad, therfore<br>

it behooues men to be wary<br>

<p id="id10256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Feare not thou man, thou shalt lose nothing here<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. I hope so sir, for I haue about me many parcels<br>

of charge<br>

<p id="id10257">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. What hast heere? Ballads?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mop. Pray now buy some: I loue a ballet in print, a<br>

life, for then we are sure they are true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10258"> Aut. Here's one, to a very dolefull tune, how a Vsurers
wife was brought to bed of twenty money baggs at
a burthen, and how she long'd to eate Adders heads, and
Toads carbonado'd</p><br>

<p id="id10259">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mop. Is it true, thinke you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Very true, and but a moneth old<br>

Why should I carry lyes abroad?<br>

<p id="id10262">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Come-on, lay it by: and let's first see moe Ballads:<br>

Wee'l buy the other things anon<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10263"> Aut. Here's another ballad of a Fish, that appeared
vpon the coast, on wensday the fourescore of April, fortie
thousand fadom aboue water, &amp; sung this ballad against
the hard hearts of maids: it was thought she was a Woman,
and was turn'd into a cold fish, for she wold not exchange
flesh with one that lou'd her: The Ballad is very
pittifull, and as true</p><br>

<p id="id10264"> Dor. Is it true too, thinke you</p><br>

<p id="id10268"> Mop. Let's haue some merry ones</p><br>

<p id="id10269"> Aut. Why this is a passing merry one, and goes to the
tune of two maids wooing a man: there's scarse a Maide
westward but she sings it: 'tis in request, I can tell you</p><br>

<p id="id10270" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Mop. We can both sing it: if thou'lt beare a part, thou

<p id="id10315">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Why how now Father,<br>

Speake ere thou dyest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10316">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. I cannot speake, nor thinke,<br>

Nor dare to know, that which I know: O Sir,<br>

You haue vndone a man of fourescore three,<br>

That thought to fill his graue in quiet: yea,<br>

To dye vpon the bed my father dy'de,<br>

To lye close by his honest bones; but now<br>

Some Hangman must put on my shrowd, and lay me<br>

Where no Priest shouels-in dust. Oh cursed wretch,<br>

That knew'st this was the Prince, and wouldst aduenture<br>

To mingle faith with him. Vndone, vndone:<br>

If I might dye within this houre, I haue liu'd<br>

To die when I desire.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10317">&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Why looke you so vpon me?<br>

I am but sorry, not affear'd: delaid,<br>

But nothing altred: What I was, I am:<br>

More straining on, for plucking backe; not following<br>

My leash vnwillingly<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10318">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Gracious my Lord,<br>

You know my Fathers temper: at this time<br>

He will allow no speech: (which I do ghesse<br>

You do not purpose to him:) and as hardly<br>

Will he endure your sight, as yet I feare;<br>

Then till the fury of his Highnesse settle<br>

Come not before him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10319">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. I not purpose it:<br>

I thinke Camillo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10320"> Cam. Euen he, my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id10321">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per. How often haue I told you 'twould be thus?<br>

How often said my dignity would last<br>

But till 'twer knowne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. It cannot faile, but by<br>

The violation of my faith, and then<br>

Let Nature crush the sides o'th earth together,<br>

And marre the seeds within. Lift vp thy lookes:<br>

From my succession wipe me (Father) I<br>

Am heyre to my affection<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10322"> Cam. Be aduis'd</p><br>

<p id="id10323">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. I am: and by my fancie, if my Reason<br>

Will thereto be obedient: I haue reason:<br>

If not, my sences better pleas'd with madnesse,<br>

Do bid it welcome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10324">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. This is desperate (sir.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. So call it: but it do's fulfill my vow:<br>

I needs must thinke it honesty. Camillo,<br>

Not for Bohemia, nor the pompe that may<br>

Be thereat gleaned: for all the Sun sees, or<br>

The close earth wombes, or the profound seas, hides<br>

In vnknowne fadomes, will I breake my oath<br>

To this my faire belou'd: Therefore, I pray you,<br>

As you haue euer bin my Fathers honour'd friend,<br>

When he shall misse me, as (in faith I meane not<br>

To see him any more) cast your good counsailes<br>

Vpon his passion: Let my selfe, and Fortune<br>

Tug for the time to come. This you may know,<br>

And so deliuer, I am put to Sea<br>

With her, who heere I cannot hold on shore:<br>

And most opportune to her neede, I haue<br>

A Vessell rides fast by, but not prepar'd<br>

For this designe. What course I meane to hold<br>

Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor<br>

Concerne me the reporting<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10325">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. O my Lord,<br>

I would your spirit were easier for aduice,<br>

Or stronger for your neede<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10326">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Hearke Perdita,<br>

Ile heare you by and by<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10327">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Hee's irremoueable,<br>

Resolu'd for flight: Now were I happy if<br>

His going, I could frame to serue my turne,<br>

Saue him from danger, do him loue and honor,<br>

Purchase the sight againe of deere Sicillia,<br>

And that vnhappy King, my Master, whom<br>

I so much thirst to see<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Now good Camillo,<br>

I am so fraught with curious businesse, that<br>

I leaue out ceremony<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10329">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Sir, I thinke<br>

You haue heard of my poore seruices, i'th loue<br>

That I haue borne your Father?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Very nobly<br>

Haue you deseru'd: It is my Fathers Musicke<br>

To speake your deeds: not little of his care<br>

To haue them recompenc'd, as thought on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10330">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Well (my Lord)<br>

If you may please to thinke I loue the King,<br>

And through him, what's neerest to him, which is<br>

Your gracious selfe; embrace but my direction,<br>

If your more ponderous and setled proiect<br>

May suffer alteration. On mine honor,<br>

Ile point you where you shall haue such receiuing<br>

As shall become your Highnesse, where you may<br>

Enioy your Mistris; from the whom, I see<br>

There's no disiunction to be made, but by<br>

(As heauens forefend) your ruine: Marry her,<br>

And with my best endeuours, in your absence,<br>

Your discontenting Father, striue to qualifie<br>

And bring him vp to liking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10331">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. How Camillo<br>

May this (almost a miracle) be done?<br>

That I may call thee something more then man,<br>

And after that trust to thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10332">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Haue you thought on<br>

A place whereto you'l go?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Not any yet:<br>

But as th' vnthought-on accident is guiltie<br>

To what we wildely do, so we professe<br>

Our selues to be the slaues of chance, and flyes<br>

Of euery winde that blowes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Then list to me:<br>

This followes, if you will not change your purpose<br>

But vndergo this flight: make for Sicillia,<br>

And there present your selfe, and your fayre Princesse,<br>

(For so I see she must be) 'fore Leontes;<br>

She shall be habited, as it becomes<br>

The partner of your Bed. Me thinkes I see<br>

Leontes opening his free Armes, and weeping<br>

His Welcomes forth: asks thee there Sonne forgiuenesse,<br>

As 'twere i'th' Fathers person: kisses the hands<br>

Of your fresh Princesse; ore and ore diuides him,<br>

'Twixt his vnkindnesse, and his Kindnesse: th' one<br>

He chides to Hell, and bids the other grow<br>

Faster then Thought, or Time<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10334">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Worthy Camillo,<br>

What colour for my Visitation, shall I<br>

Hold vp before him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Sent by the King your Father<br>

To greet him, and to giue him comforts. Sir,<br>

The manner of your bearing towards him, with<br>

What you (as from your Father) shall deliuer,<br>

Things knowne betwixt vs three, Ile write you downe,<br>

The which shall point you forth at euery sitting<br>

What you must say: that he shall not perceiue,<br>

But that you haue your Fathers Bosome there,<br>

And speake his very Heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10335">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. I am bound to you:<br>

There is some sappe in this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10336">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. A Course more promising,<br>

Then a wild dedication of your selues<br>

To vnpath'd Waters, vndream'd Shores; most certaine,<br>

To Miseries enough: no hope to helpe you,<br>

But as you shake off one, to take another:<br>

Nothing so certaine, as your Anchors, who<br>

Doe their best office, if they can but stay you,<br>

Where you'le be loth to be: besides you know,<br>

Prosperitie's the very bond of Loue,<br>

Whose fresh complexion, and whose heart together,<br>

Affliction alters<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10337">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. One of these is true:<br>

I thinke Affliction may subdue the Cheeke,<br>

But not take-in the Mind<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10338">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Yea? say you so?<br>

There shall not, at your Fathers House, these seuen yeeres<br>

Be borne another such<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10339">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. My good Camillo,<br>

She's as forward, of her Breeding, as<br>

She is i'th' reare' our Birth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10340">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. I cannot say, 'tis pitty<br>

She lacks Instructions, for she seemes a Mistresse<br>

To most that teach<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10341">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. Your pardon Sir, for this,<br>

Ile blush you Thanks<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10342">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. My prettiest Perdita.<br>

But O, the Thornes we stand vpon: (Camillo)<br>

Preseruer of my Father, now of me,<br>

The Medicine of our House: how shall we doe?<br>

We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's Sonne,<br>

Nor shall appeare in Sicilia<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10343">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. My Lord,<br>

Feare none of this: I thinke you know my fortunes<br>

Doe all lye there: it shall be so my care,<br>

To haue you royally appointed, as if<br>

The Scene you play, were mine. For instance Sir,<br>

That you may know you shall not want: one word.<br>

Enter Autolicus.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10344"> Aut. Ha, ha, what a Foole Honestie is? and Trust (his
sworne brother) a very simple Gentleman. I haue sold
all my Tromperie: not a counterfeit Stone, not a Ribbon,
Glasse, Pomander, Browch, Table-booke, Ballad, Knife,
Tape, Gloue, Shooe-tye, Bracelet, Horne-Ring, to keepe
my Pack from fasting: they throng who should buy first,
as if my Trinkets had beene hallowed, and brought a benediction
to the buyer: by which meanes, I saw whose
Purse was best in Picture; and what I saw, to my good
vse, I remembred. My Clowne (who wants but something
to be a reasonable man) grew so in loue with the
Wenches Song, that hee would not stirre his Petty-toes,
till he had both Tune and Words, which so drew the rest
of the Heard to me, that all their other Sences stucke in
Eares: you might haue pinch'd a Placket, it was sencelesse;
'twas nothing to gueld a Cod-peece of a Purse: I
would haue fill'd Keyes of that hung in Chaynes: no
hearing, no feeling, but my Sirs Song, and admiring the
Nothing of it. So that in this time of Lethargie, I pickd
and cut most of their Festiuall Purses: And had not the
old-man come in with a Whoo-bub against his Daughter,
and the Kings Sonne, and scar'd my Chowghes from
the Chaffe, I had not left a Purse aliue in the whole
Army</p><br>

<p id="id10345">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Nay, but my Letters by this meanes being there<br>

So soone as you arriue, shall cleare that doubt<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10346">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. And those that you'le procure from King Leontes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Shall satisfie your Father<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10347">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. Happy be you:<br>

All that you speake, shewes faire<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10348">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Who haue we here?<br>

Wee'le make an Instrument of this: omit<br>

Nothing may giue vs aide<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10349"> Aut. If they haue ouer-heard me now: why hanging</p><br>

<p id="id10350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. How now (good Fellow)<br>

Why shak'st thou so? Feare not (man)<br>

Here's no harme intended to thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10351"> Aut. I am a poore Fellow, Sir</p><br>

<p id="id10352"> Cam. Why, be so still: here's no body will steale that
from thee: yet for the out-side of thy pouertie, we must
make an exchange; therefore dis-case thee instantly (thou
must thinke there's a necessitie in't) and change Garments
with this Gentleman: Though the penny-worth (on his
side) be the worst, yet hold thee, there's some boot</p><br>

<p id="id10353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. I am a poore Fellow, Sir: (I know ye well<br>

enough.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Nay prethee dispatch: the Gentleman is halfe<br>

fled already<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10354">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Are you in earnest, Sir? (I smell the trick on't.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Dispatch, I prethee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10355">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Indeed I haue had Earnest, but I cannot with<br>

conscience take it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10356">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Vnbuckle, vnbuckle.<br>

Fortunate Mistresse (let my prophecie<br>

Come home to ye:) you must retire your selfe<br>

Into some Couert; take your sweet-hearts Hat<br>

And pluck it ore your Browes, muffle your face,<br>

Dis-mantle you, and (as you can) disliken<br>

The truth of your owne seeming, that you may<br>

(For I doe feare eyes ouer) to Ship-boord<br>

Get vndescry'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perd. I see the Play so lyes,<br>

That I must beare a part<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10358">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. No remedie:<br>

Haue you done there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Should I now meet my Father,<br>

He would not call me Sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10359">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. Nay, you shall haue no Hat:<br>

Come Lady, come: Farewell (my friend.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Adieu, Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. O Perdita: what haue we twaine forgot?<br>

'Pray you a word<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10361">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. What I doe next, shall be to tell the King<br>

Of this escape, and whither they are bound;<br>

Wherein, my hope is, I shall so preuaile,<br>

To force him after: in whose company<br>

I shall re-view Sicilia; for whose sight,<br>

I haue a Womans Longing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flo. Fortune speed vs:<br>

Thus we set on (Camillo) to th' Sea-side<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10363">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. The swifter speed, the better.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10364"> Aut. I vnderstand the businesse, I heare it: to haue an
open eare, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for
a Cut-purse; a good Nose is requisite also, to smell out
worke for th' other Sences. I see this is the time that the
vniust man doth thriue. What an exchange had this been,
without boot? What a boot is here, with this exchange?
Sure the Gods doe this yeere conniue at vs, and we may
doe any thing extempore. The Prince himselfe is about
a peece of Iniquitie (stealing away from his Father, with
his Clog at his heeles:) if I thought it were a peece of honestie
to acquaint the King withall, I would not do't: I
hold it the more knauerie to conceale it; and therein am
I constant to my Profession.
Enter Clowne and Shepheard.</p><br>

<p id="id10365">Aside, aside, here is more matter for a hot braine: Euery
Lanes end, euery Shop, Church, Session, Hanging, yeelds
a carefull man worke</p><br>

<p id="id10366"> Clowne. See, see: what a man you are now? there is no
other way, but to tell the King she's a Changeling, and
none of your flesh and blood</p><br>

<p id="id10367"> Shep. Nay, but heare me</p><br>

<p id="id10368"> Clow. Nay; but heare me</p><br>

<p id="id10369"> Shep. Goe too then</p><br>

<p id="id10370"> Clow. She being none of your flesh and blood, your
flesh and blood ha's not offended the King, and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punish'd by him. Shew those
things you found about her (those secret things, all but
what she ha's with her:) This being done, let the Law goe
whistle: I warrant you</p><br>

<p id="id10371"> Shep. I will tell the King all, euery word, yea, and his
Sonnes prancks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
neither to his Father, nor to me, to goe about to make me
the Kings Brother in Law</p><br>

<p id="id10372"> Clow. Indeed Brother in Law was the farthest off you
could haue beene to him, and then your Blood had beene
the dearer, by I know how much an ounce</p><br>

<p id="id10373">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Very wisely (Puppies.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. Well: let vs to the King: there is that in this<br>

Farthell, will make him scratch his Beard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10374">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. I know not what impediment this Complaint<br>

may be to the flight of my Master<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10375"> Clo. 'Pray heartily he be at' Pallace</p><br>

<p id="id10376"> Aut. Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes
by chance: Let me pocket vp my Pedlers excrement.
How now (Rustiques) whither are you bound?
 Shep. To th' Pallace (and it like your Worship.)
 Aut. Your Affaires there? what? with whom? the
Condition of that Farthell? the place of your dwelling?
your names? your ages? of what hauing? breeding, and
any thing that is fitting to be knowne, discouer?
 Clo. We are but plaine fellowes, Sir</p><br>

<p id="id10377"> Aut. A Lye; you are rough, and hayrie: Let me haue
no lying; it becomes none but Trades-men, and they often
giue vs (Souldiers) the Lye, but wee pay them for it
with stamped Coyne, not stabbing Steele, therefore they
doe not giue vs the Lye</p><br>

<p id="id10378" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Clo. Your Worship had like to haue giuen vs one, if
you had not taken your selfe with the manner</p><br>

<p id="id10379"> Shep. Are you a Courtier, and't like you Sir?
 Aut. Whether it like me, or no, I am a Courtier. Seest
thou not the ayre of the Court, in these enfoldings? Hath
not my gate in it, the measure of the Court? Receiues not
thy Nose Court-Odour from me? Reflect I not on thy
Basenesse, Court-Contempt? Think'st thou, for that I
insinuate, at toaze from thee thy Businesse, I am therefore
no Courtier? I am Courtier Capape; and one that
will eyther push-on, or pluck-back, thy Businesse there:
whereupon I command thee to open thy Affaire</p><br>

<p id="id10380"> Shep. My Businesse, Sir, is to the King</p><br>

<p id="id10381">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. What Aduocate ha'st thou to him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. I know not (and't like you.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clo. Aduocate's the Court-word for a Pheazant: say<br>

you haue none<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10382"> Shep. None, Sir: I haue no Pheazant Cock, nor Hen</p><br>

<p id="id10383">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. How blessed are we, that are not simple men?<br>

Yet Nature might haue made me as these are,<br>

Therefore I will not disdaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10384"> Clo. This cannot be but a great Courtier</p><br>

<p id="id10385" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Shep. His Garments are rich, but he weares them not
handsomely</p><br>

<p id="id10386"> Clo. He seemes to be the more Noble, in being fantasticall:
A great man, Ile warrant; I know by the picking
on's Teeth</p><br>

<p id="id10387"> Aut. The Farthell there? What's i'th' Farthell?
Wherefore that Box?
 Shep. Sir, there lyes such Secrets in this Farthell and
Box, which none must know but the King, and which hee
shall know within this houre, if I may come to th' speech
of him</p><br>

<p id="id10388"> Aut. Age, thou hast lost thy labour</p><br>

<p id="id10389"> Shep. Why Sir?
 Aut. The King is not at the Pallace, he is gone aboord
a new Ship, to purge Melancholy, and ayre himselfe: for
if thou bee'st capable of things serious, thou must know
the King is full of griefe</p><br>

<p id="id10390" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Shep. So 'tis said (Sir:) about his Sonne, that should
haue marryed a Shepheards Daughter</p><br>

<p id="id10391"> Aut. If that Shepheard be not in hand-fast, let him
flye; the Curses he shall haue, the Tortures he shall feele,
will breake the back of Man, the heart of Monster</p><br>

<p id="id10392"> Clo. Thinke you so, Sir?
 Aut. Not hee alone shall suffer what Wit can make
heauie, and Vengeance bitter; but those that are Iermaine
to him (though remou'd fiftie times) shall all come vnder
the Hang-man: which, though it be great pitty, yet it is
necessarie. An old Sheepe-whistling Rogue, a Ram-tender,
to offer to haue his Daughter come into grace? Some
say hee shall be ston'd: but that death is too soft for him
(say I:) Draw our Throne into a Sheep-Coat? all deaths
are too few, the sharpest too easie</p><br>

<p id="id10393"> Clo. Ha's the old-man ere a Sonne Sir (doe you heare)
and't like you, Sir?
 Aut. Hee ha's a Sonne: who shall be flayd aliue, then
'noynted ouer with Honey, set on the head of a Waspes
Nest, then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead:
then recouer'd againe with Aquavite, or some other hot
Infusion: then, raw as he is (and in the hotest day Prognostication
proclaymes) shall he be set against a Brick-wall,
(the Sunne looking with a South-ward eye vpon him;
where hee is to behold him, with Flyes blown to death.)
But what talke we of these Traitorly-Rascals, whose miseries
are to be smil'd at, their offences being so capitall?
Tell me (for you seeme to be honest plaine men) what you
haue to the King: being something gently consider'd, Ile
bring you where he is aboord, tender your persons to his
presence, whisper him in your behalfes; and if it be in
man, besides the King, to effect your Suites, here is man
shall doe it</p><br>

<p id="id10394"> Clow. He seemes to be of great authoritie: close with
him, giue him Gold; and though Authoritie be a stubborne
Beare, yet hee is oft led by the Nose with Gold:
shew the in-side of your Purse to the out-side of his
hand, and no more adoe. Remember ston'd, and flay'd
aliue</p><br>

<p id="id10395"> Shep. And't please you (Sir) to vndertake the Businesse
for vs, here is that Gold I haue: Ile make it as much
more, and leaue this young man in pawne, till I bring it
you</p><br>

<p id="id10396">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. After I haue done what I promised?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. I Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10397">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Well, giue me the Moitie: Are you a partie in<br>

this Businesse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. In some sort, Sir: but though my case be a pittifull<br>

one, I hope I shall not be flayd out of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10398">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aut. Oh, that's the case of the Shepheards Sonne:<br>

hang him, hee'le be made an example<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10399"> Clow. Comfort, good comfort: We must to the King,
and shew our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of
your Daughter, nor my Sister: wee are gone else. Sir, I
will giue you as much as this old man do's, when the Businesse
is performed, and remaine (as he sayes) your pawne
till it be brought you</p><br>

<p id="id10400"> Aut. I will trust you. Walke before toward the Seaside,
goe on the right hand, I will but looke vpon the
Hedge, and follow you</p><br>

<p id="id10401">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clow. We are bless'd, in this man: as I may say, euen<br>

bless'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10402">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shep. Let's before, as he bids vs: he was prouided to<br>

doe vs good<br>

<p id="id10403"> Aut. If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer mee: shee drops Booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion: (Gold, and a means
to doe the Prince my Master good; which, who knowes
how that may turne backe to my aduancement?) I will
bring these two Moales, these blind-ones, aboord him: if
he thinke it fit to shoare them againe, and that the Complaint
they haue to the King, concernes him nothing, let
him call me Rogue, for being so farre officious, for I am

<p id="id10407">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleo. Sir, you haue done enough, and haue perform'd<br>

A Saint-like Sorrow: No fault could you make,<br>

Which you haue not redeem'd; indeed pay'd downe<br>

More penitence, then done trespas: At the last<br>

Doe, as the Heauens haue done; forget your euill,<br>

With them, forgiue your selfe<br>

<p id="id10408">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Whilest I remember<br>

Her, and her Vertues, I cannot forget<br>

My blemishes in them, and so still thinke of<br>

The wrong I did my selfe: which was so much,<br>

That Heire-lesse it hath made my Kingdome, and<br>

Destroy'd the sweet'st Companion, that ere man<br>

Bred his hopes out of, true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10409">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. Too true (my Lord:)<br>

If one by one, you wedded all the World,<br>

Or from the All that are, tooke something good,<br>

To make a perfect Woman; she you kill'd,<br>

Would be vnparallell'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10410">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. I thinke so. Kill'd?<br>

She I kill'd? I did so: but thou strik'st me<br>

Sorely, to say I did: it is as bitter<br>

Vpon thy Tongue, as in my Thought. Now, good now,<br>

Say so but seldome<br>

<p id="id10411">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleo. Not at all, good Lady:<br>

You might haue spoken a thousand things, that would<br>

Of his most Soueraigne Name: Consider little,<br>

What Dangers, by his Highnesse faile of Issue,<br>

May drop vpon his Kingdome, and deuoure<br>

Incertaine lookers on. What were more holy,<br>

Then to reioyce the former Queene is well?<br>

What holyer, then for Royalties repayre,<br>

For present comfort, and for future good,<br>

To blesse the Bed of Maiestie againe<br>

With a sweet Fellow to't?<br>

For ha's not the Diuine Apollo said?<br>

Is't not the tenor of his Oracle,<br>

That King Leontes shall not haue an Heire,<br>

Till his lost Child be found? Which, that it shall,<br>

Is all as monstrous to our humane reason,<br>

As my Antigonus to breake his Graue,<br>

And come againe to me: who, on my life,<br>

Did perish with the Infant. 'Tis your councell,<br>

My Lord should to the Heauens be contrary,<br>

Oppose against their wills. Care not for Issue,<br>

The Crowne will find an Heire. Great Alexander<br>

Left his to th' Worthiest: so his Successor<br>

Was like to be the best<br>

More rich, for what they yeelded<br>

<p id="id10416">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Thou speak'st truth:<br>

No more such Wiues, therefore no Wife: one worse,<br>

And better vs'd, would make her Sainted Spirit<br>

Againe possesse her Corps, and on this Stage<br>

(Where we Offendors now appeare) Soule-vext,<br>

And begin, why to me?<br>

You chose her: then Il'd shrieke, that euen your eares<br>

Sonne of Polixenes, with his Princesse (she<br>

The fairest I haue yet beheld) desires accesse<br>

To your high presence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10429">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. What with him? he comes not<br>

Like to his Fathers Greatnesse: his approach<br>

(So out of circumstance, and suddaine) tells vs,<br>

'Tis not a Visitation fram'd, but forc'd<br>

By need, and accident. What Trayne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. But few,<br>

And those but meane<br>

<p id="id10430">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. His Princesse (say you) with him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. I: the most peerelesse peece of Earth, I thinke,<br>

That ere the Sunne shone bright on<br>

<p id="id10431">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. Oh Hermione,<br>

As euery present Time doth boast it selfe<br>

Aboue a better, gone; so must thy Graue<br>

Giue way to what's seene now. Sir, you your selfe<br>

Haue said, and writ so; but your writing now<br>

Is colder then that Theame: she had not beene,<br>

Nor was not to be equall'd, thus your Verse<br>

Flow'd with her Beautie once; 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,<br>

To say you haue seene a better<br>

<p id="id10432">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. Pardon, Madame:<br>

The one, I haue almost forgot (your pardon:)<br>

The other, when she ha's obtayn'd your Eye,<br>

Would she begin a Sect, might quench the zeale<br>

Of who she but bid follow<br>

<p id="id10433">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. How? not women?<br>

More worth then any Man: Men, that she is<br>

The rarest of all Women<br>

<p id="id10437">Your Mother was most true to Wedlock, Prince,<br>

Expos'd this Paragon to th' fearefull vsage<br>

(At least vngentle) of the dreadfull Neptune,<br>

Wretches so quake: they kneele, they kisse the Earth;<br>

Forsweare themselues as often as they speake:<br>

<p id="id10456" style="margin-top: 2em">Scoena Secunda.</p><br>

<p id="id10457" style="margin-top: 2em">Enter Autolicus, and a Gentleman.</p><br>

<p id="id10458"> Aut. Beseech you (Sir) were you present at this Relation?
 Gent.1. I was by at the opening of the Farthell, heard
the old Shepheard deliuer the manner how he found it:
Whereupon (after a little amazednesse) we were all commanded
out of the Chamber: onely this (me thought) I
heard the Shepheard say, he found the Child</p><br>

<p id="id10459"> Aut. I would most gladly know the issue of it</p><br>

<p id="id10460"> Gent.1. I make a broken deliuerie of the Businesse;
but the changes I perceiued in the King, and Camillo, were
very Notes of admiration: they seem'd almost, with staring
on one another, to teare the Cases of their Eyes.
There was speech in their dumbnesse, Language in their
very gesture: they look'd as they had heard of a World
ransom'd, or one destroyed: a notable passion of Wonder
appeared in them: but the wisest beholder, that knew
no more but seeing, could not say, if th' importance were
Ioy, or Sorrow; but in the extremitie of the one, it must
needs be.
Enter another Gentleman.</p><br>

<p id="id10461">Here comes a Gentleman, that happily knowes more:<br>

The Newes, Rogero<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10462"> Gent.2. Nothing but Bon-fires: the Oracle is fulfill'd:
the Kings Daughter is found: such a deale of wonder is
broken out within this houre, that Ballad-makers cannot
be able to expresse it.
Enter another Gentleman.</p><br>

<p id="id10463">Here comes the Lady Paulina's Steward, hee can deliuer
you more. How goes it now (Sir.) This Newes (which
is call'd true) is so like an old Tale, that the veritie of it is
in strong suspition: Ha's the King found his Heire?
 Gent.3. Most true, if euer Truth were pregnant by
Circumstance: That which you heare, you'le sweare
you see, there is such vnitie in the proofes. The Mantle
of Queene Hermiones: her Iewell about the Neck of it:
the Letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know
to be his Character: the Maiestie of the Creature, in resemblance
of the Mother: the Affection of Noblenesse,
which Nature shewes aboue her Breeding, and many other
Euidences, proclayme her, with all certaintie, to be
the Kings Daughter. Did you see the meeting of the
two Kings?
 Gent.2. No</p><br>

<p id="id10464"> Gent.3. Then haue you lost a Sight which was to bee
seene, cannot bee spoken of. There might you haue beheld
one Ioy crowne another, so and in such manner, that
it seem'd Sorrow wept to take leaue of them: for their
Ioy waded in teares. There was casting vp of Eyes, holding
vp of Hands, with Countenance of such distraction,
that they were to be knowne by Garment, not by Fauor.
Our King being ready to leape out of himselfe, for ioy of
his found Daughter; as if that Ioy were now become a
Losse, cryes, Oh, thy Mother, thy Mother: then askes
Bohemia forgiuenesse, then embraces his Sonne-in-Law:
then againe worryes he his Daughter, with clipping her.
Now he thanks the old Shepheard (which stands by, like
a Weather-bitten Conduit, of many Kings Reignes.) I
neuer heard of such another Encounter; which lames Report
to follow it, and vndo's description to doe it</p><br>

<p id="id10465"> Gent.2. What, 'pray you, became of Antigonus, that
carryed hence the Child?
 Gent.3. Like an old Tale still, which will haue matter
to rehearse, though Credit be asleepe, and not an eare open;
he was torne to pieces with a Beare: This auouches
the Shepheards Sonne; who ha's not onely his Innocence
(which seemes much) to iustifie him, but a Hand-kerchief
and Rings of his, that Paulina knowes</p><br>

<p id="id10466"> Gent.1. What became of his Barke, and his Followers?
 Gent.3. Wrackt the same instant of their Masters
death, and in the view of the Shepheard: so that all the
Instruments which ayded to expose the Child, were euen
then lost, when it was found. But oh the Noble Combat,
that 'twixt Ioy and Sorrow was fought in Paulina. Shee
had one Eye declin'd for the losse of her Husband, another
eleuated, that the Oracle was fulfill'd: Shee lifted the
Princesse from the Earth, and so locks her in embracing,
as if shee would pin her to her heart, that shee might no
more be in danger of loosing</p><br>

<p id="id10467" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Gent.1. The Dignitie of this Act was worth the audience
of Kings and Princes, for by such was it acted</p><br>

<p id="id10468"> Gent.3. One of the prettyest touches of all, and that
which angl'd for mine Eyes (caught the Water, though
not the Fish) was, when at the Relation of the Queenes
death (with the manner how shee came to't, brauely confess'd,
and lamented by the King) how attentiuenesse
wounded his Daughter, till (from one signe of dolour to
another) shee did (with an Alas) I would faine say, bleed
Teares; for I am sure, my heart wept blood. Who was
most Marble, there changed colour: some swownded, all
sorrowed: if all the World could haue seen't, the Woe
had beene vniuersall</p><br>

<p id="id10469"> Gent.1. Are they returned to the Court?
 Gent.3. No: The Princesse hearing of her Mothers
Statue (which is in the keeping of Paulina) a Peece many
yeeres in doing, and now newly perform'd, by that rare
Italian Master, Iulio Romano, who (had he himselfe Eternitie,
and could put Breath into his Worke) would beguile
Nature of her Custome, so perfectly he is her Ape:
He so neere to Hermione, hath done Hermione, that they
say one would speake to her, and stand in hope of answer.
Thither (with all greedinesse of affection) are they gone,
and there they intend to Sup</p><br>

<p id="id10470"> Gent.2. I thought she had some great matter there in
hand, for shee hath priuately, twice or thrice a day, euer
since the death of Hermione, visited that remoued House.
Shall wee thither, and with our companie peece the Reioycing?
 Gent.1. Who would be thence, that ha's the benefit
of Accesse? euery winke of an Eye, some new Grace
will be borne: our Absence makes vs vnthriftie to our
Knowledge. Let's along.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id10471"> Aut. Now (had I not the dash of my former life in
me) would Preferment drop on my head. I brought the
old man and his Sonne aboord the Prince; told him, I
heard them talke of a Farthell, and I know not what: but
he at that time ouer-fond of the Shepheards Daughter (so
he then tooke her to be) who began to be much Sea-sick,
and himselfe little better, extremitie of Weather continuing,
this Mysterie remained vndiscouer'd. But 'tis all
one to me: for had I beene the finder-out of this Secret,
it would not haue rellish'd among my other discredits.
Enter Shepheard and Clowne.</p><br>

<p id="id10472">Here come those I haue done good to against my will,

That I haue had of thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. What (Soueraigne Sir)<br>

I did not well, I meant well: all my Seruices<br>

You haue pay'd home. But that you haue vouchsaf'd<br>

(With your Crown'd Brother, and these your contracted<br>

Heires of your Kingdomes) my poore House to visit;<br>

It is a surplus of your Grace, which neuer<br>

My life may last to answere<br>

<p id="id10494">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. O Paulina,<br>

We honor you with trouble: but we came<br>

To see the Statue of our Queene. Your Gallerie<br>

Haue we pass'd through, not without much content<br>

In many singularities; but we saw not<br>

That which my Daughter came to looke vpon,<br>

The Statue of her Mother<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10495">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. As she liu'd peerelesse,<br>

So her dead likenesse I doe well beleeue<br>

Excells what euer yet you look'd vpon,<br>

Or hand of Man hath done: therefore I keepe it<br>

Louely, apart. But here it is: prepare<br>

To see the Life as liuely mock'd, as euer<br>

Still Sleepe mock'd Death: behold, and say 'tis well.<br>

I like your silence, it the more shewes-off<br>

Your wonder: but yet speake, first you (my Liege)<br>

Comes it not something neere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Her naturall Posture.<br>

Chide me (deare Stone) that I may say indeed<br>

Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she,<br>

In thy not chiding: for she was as tender<br>

As Infancie, and Grace. But yet (Paulina)<br>

Hermione was not so much wrinckled, nothing<br>

So aged as this seemes<br>

So much to my good comfort, as it is<br>

Now piercing to my Soule. Oh, thus she stood,<br>

Euen with such Life of Maiestie (warme Life,<br>

As now it coldly stands) when first I woo'd her.<br>

I am asham'd: Do's not the Stone rebuke me,<br>

For being more Stone then it? Oh Royall Peece:<br>

There's Magick in thy Maiestie, which ha's<br>

Deere Queene, that ended when I but began,<br>

Giue me that hand of yours, to kisse<br>

<p id="id10500">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. O, patience:<br>

The Statue is but newly fix'd; the Colour's<br>

Not dry<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10501">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. My Lord, your Sorrow was too sore lay'd-on,<br>

No setled Sences of the World can match<br>

The pleasure of that madnesse. Let't alone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10510">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. I am sorry (Sir) I haue thus farre stir'd you: but<br>

For this Affliction ha's a taste as sweet<br>

As any Cordiall comfort. Still me thinkes<br>

There is an ayre comes from her. What fine Chizzell<br>

Could euer yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,<br>

For I will kisse her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10512">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. Good my Lord, forbeare:<br>

<p id="id10513"> Leo. No: not these twentie yeeres</p><br>

<p id="id10515">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. Either forbeare,<br>

Quit presently the Chappell, or resolue you<br>

For more amazement: if you can behold it,<br>

Ile make the Statue moue indeed; descend,<br>

And take you by the hand: but then you'le thinke<br>

(Which I protest against) I am assisted<br>

By wicked Powers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10516">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. What you can make her doe,<br>

I am content to looke on: what to speake,<br>

I am content to heare: for 'tis as easie<br>

To make her speake, as moue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10517">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. It is requir'd<br>

You doe awake your Faith: then, all stand still:<br>

On: those that thinke it is vnlawfull Businesse<br>

I am about, let them depart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10518">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. Proceed:<br>

No foot shall stirre<br>

<p id="id10519">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. Musick; awake her: Strike:<br>

'Tis time: descend: be Stone no more: approach:<br>

Strike all that looke vpon with meruaile: Come:<br>

Ile fill your Graue vp: stirre: nay, come away:<br>

Bequeath to Death your numnesse: (for from him,<br>

Deare Life redeemes you) you perceiue she stirres:<br>

Start not: her Actions shall be holy, as<br>

Vntill you see her dye againe; for then<br>

You kill her double: Nay, present your Hand:<br>

When she was young, you woo'd her: now, in age,<br>

Were it but told you, should be hooted at<br>

Like an old Tale: but it appeares she liues,<br>

Though yet she speake not. Marke a little while:<br>

Please you to interpose (faire Madam) kneele,<br>

And pray your Mothers blessing: turne good Lady,<br>

Thy Fathers Court? For thou shalt heare that I<br>

Knowing by Paulina, that the Oracle<br>

Gaue hope thou wast in being, haue preseru'd<br>

My selfe, to see the yssue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10524">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. There's time enough for that,<br>

Least they desire (vpon this push) to trouble<br>

Your ioyes, with like Relation. Go together<br>

You precious winners all: your exultation<br>

Partake to euery one: I (an old Turtle)<br>

Will wing me to some wither'd bough, and there<br>

My Mate (that's neuer to be found againe)<br>

Lament, till I am lost<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10525">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo. O peace Paulina:<br>

Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,<br>

As I by thine a Wife. This is a Match,<br>

And made betweene's by Vowes. Thou hast found mine,<br>

But how, is to be question'd: for I saw her<br>

(As I thought) dead: and haue (in vaine) said many<br>

A prayer vpon her graue. Ile not seeke farre<br>

(For him, I partly know his minde) to finde thee<br>

An honourable husband. Come Camillo,<br>

And take her by the hand: whose worth, and honesty<br>

Is richly noted: and heere iustified<br>

By Vs, a paire of Kings. Let's from this place.<br>

What? looke vpon my Brother: both your pardons,<br>

That ere I put betweene your holy lookes<br>

And Sonne vnto the King, whom heauens directing<br>

Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10554">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob. And once dispatch'd him in an Embassie<br>

To Germany, there with the Emperor<br>

To treat of high affaires touching that time:<br>

Th' aduantage of his absence tooke the King,<br>

And in the meane time soiourn'd at my fathers;<br>

Where how he did preuaile, I shame to speake:<br>

But truth is truth, large lengths of seas and shores<br>

Betweene my father, and my mother lay,<br>

As I haue heard my father speake himselfe<br>

When this same lusty gentleman was got:<br>

Vpon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd<br>

His lands to me, and tooke it on his death<br>

That this my mothers sonne was none of his;<br>

And if he were, he came into the world<br>

Full fourteene weekes before the course of time:<br>

Then good my Liedge let me haue what is mine,<br>

My fathers land, as was my fathers will<br>
</p><br>

Your fathers wife did after wedlocke beare him:<br>

And if she did play false, the fault was hers,<br>

Which fault lyes on the hazards of all husbands<br>

That marry wiues: tell me, how if my brother<br>

Who as you say, tooke paines to get this sonne,<br>

Had of your father claim'd this sonne for his,<br>

Insooth, good friend, your father might haue kept<br>

This Calfe, bred from his Cow from all the world:<br>

Insooth he might: then if he were my brothers,<br>

My brother might not claime him, nor your father<br>

Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes,<br>

My mothers sonne did get your fathers heyre,<br>

Your fathers heyre must haue your fathers land<br>

Then was his will to get me, as I think<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10558">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,<br>

And like thy brother to enioy thy land:<br>

Or the reputed sonne of Cordelion,<br>

Lord of thy presence, and no land beside<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10559">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Madam, and if my brother had my shape<br>

And I had his, sir Roberts his like him,<br>

And if my legs were two such riding rods,<br>

My armes, such eele skins stuft, my face so thin,<br>

That in mine eare I durst not sticke a rose,<br>

Lest men should say, looke where three farthings goes,<br>

And to his shape were heyre to all this land,<br>

Would I might neuer stirre from off this place,<br>

I would giue it euery foot to haue this face:<br>

It would not be sir nobbe in any case<br>

Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?<br>

<p id="id10563"> Bast. Our Country manners giue our betters way</p><br>

<p id="id10564">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K.Iohn. What is thy name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Philip my Liege, so is my name begun,<br>

Philip, good old Sir Roberts wiues eldest sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10565">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K.Iohn. From henceforth beare his name<br>

Whose forme thou bearest:<br>

Kneele thou downe Philip, but rise more great,<br>

Arise Sir Richard, and Plantagenet<br>

<p id="id10566">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Brother by th' mothers side, giue me your hand,<br>

My father gaue me honor, yours gaue land:<br>

Now blessed be the houre by night or day<br>

When I was got, Sir Robert was away<br>

I am thy grandame Richard, call me so<br>

<p id="id10568">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Madam by chance, but not by truth, what tho;<br>

Something about a little from the right,<br>

In at the window, or else ore the hatch:<br>

Who dares not stirre by day, must walke by night,<br>

And haue is haue, how euer men doe catch:<br>

Neere or farre off, well wonne is still well shot,<br>

And I am I, how ere I was begot<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10569">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K.Iohn. Goe, Faulconbridge, now hast thou thy desire,<br>

A landlesse Knight, makes thee a landed Squire:<br>

Come Madam, and come Richard, we must speed<br>

For France, for France, for it is more then need<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10570">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Brother adieu, good fortune come to thee,<br>

For thou wast got i'th way of honesty.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10571">Exeunt. all but bastard.</p><br>

<p id="id10572">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. A foot of Honor better then I was,<br>

But many a many foot of Land the worse.<br>

Well, now can I make any Ioane a Lady,<br>

Good den Sir Richard, Godamercy fellow,<br>

And if his name be George, Ile call him Peter;<br>

For new made honor doth forget mens names:<br>

'Tis two respectiue, and too sociable<br>

For your conuersion, now your traueller,<br>

Hee and his tooth-picke at my worships messe,<br>

And when my knightly stomacke is suffis'd,<br>

Why then I sucke my teeth, and catechize<br>

My picked man of Countries: my deare sir,<br>

Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,<br>

I shall beseech you; that is question now,<br>

And then comes answer like an Absey booke:<br>

O sir, sayes answer, at your best command,<br>

At your employment, at your seruice sir:<br>

No sir, saies question, I sweet sir at yours,<br>

And so ere answer knowes what question would,<br>

Sauing in Dialogue of Complement,<br>

And talking of the Alpes and Appenines,<br>

The Perennean and the riuer Poe,<br>

It drawes toward supper in conclusion so.<br>

But this is worshipfull society,<br>

And fits the mounting spirit like my selfe;<br>

For he is but a bastard to the time<br>

That doth not smoake of obseruation,<br>

And so am I whether I smacke or no:<br>

And not alone in habit and deuice,<br>

Exterior forme, outward accoutrement;<br>

But from the inward motion to deliuer<br>

Sweet, sweet, sweet poyson for the ages tooth,<br>

Which though I will not practice to deceiue,<br>

Yet to auoid deceit I meane to learne;<br>

For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising:<br>

But who comes in such haste in riding robes?<br>

What woman post is this? hath she no husband<br>

That will take paines to blow a horne before her?<br>

O me, 'tis my mother: how now good Lady,<br>

What brings you heere to Court so hastily?<br>

Enter Lady Faulconbridge and Iames Gurney.<br>
</p><br>

That holds in chase mine honour vp and downe<br>

Colbrand the Gyant, that same mighty man,<br>

Is it Sir Roberts sonne that you seeke so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Sir Roberts sonne, I thou vnreuerend boy,<br>

Sir Roberts sonne? why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?<br>

He is Sir Roberts sonne, and so art thou<br>

But mother, I am not Sir Roberts sonne,<br>

I haue disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land,<br>

Then good my mother, let me know my father,<br>

Some proper man I hope, who was it mother?<br>

By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd<br>

To make roome for him in my husbands bed:<br>

Heauen lay not my transgression to my charge,<br>

That art the issue of my deere offence<br>

Which was so strongly vrg'd past my defence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10581">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Now by this light were I to get againe,<br>

Madam I would not wish a better father:<br>

Some sinnes doe beare their priuiledge on earth,<br>

And so doth yours: your fault, was not your follie,<br>

Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,<br>

Subiected tribute to commanding loue,<br>

Against whose furie and vnmatched force,<br>

The awlesse Lion could not wage the fight,<br>

Nor keepe his Princely heart from Richards hand:<br>

He that perforce robs Lions of their hearts,<br>

May easily winne a womans: aye my mother,<br>

With all my heart I thanke thee for my father:<br>

Who liues and dares but say, thou didst not well<br>

When I was got, Ile send his soule to hell.<br>

Come Lady I will shew thee to my kinne,<br>

And they shall say, when Richard me begot,<br>

If thou hadst sayd him nay, it had beene sinne;<br>

Who sayes it was, he lyes, I say twas not.<br>

Out of his ragges. Here's a large mouth indeede,<br>

Talkes as familiarly of roaring Lyons,<br>

As maids of thirteene do of puppi-dogges.<br>

What Cannoneere begot this lustie blood,<br>

Marke how they whisper, vrge them while their soules<br>

Are capeable of this ambition,<br>

Of soft petitions, pittie and remorse,<br>

Coole and congeale againe to what it was<br>

<p id="id10672">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fra. Speake England first, that hath bin forward first<br>

To speake vnto this Cittie: what say you?<br>

The shadow of my selfe form'd in her eye,<br>

Which being but the shadow of your sonne,<br>

Becomes a sonne and makes your sonne a shadow:<br>

Or if you will, to speake more properly,<br>

I will enforce it easlie to my loue.<br>

Though churlish thoughts themselues should bee your<br>

Full thirty thousand Markes of English coyne:<br>

Command thy sonne and daughter to ioyne hands<br>

I know she is not for this match made vp,<br>

Her presence would haue interrupted much.<br>

Where is she and her sonne, tell me, who knowes?<br>

Will giue her sadnesse very little cure:<br>

Clap'd on the outward eye of fickle France,<br>

Hath drawne him from his owne determin'd ayd,<br>

From a resolu'd and honourable warre,<br>

You came in Armes to spill mine enemies bloud,<br>

But now in Armes, you strengthen it with yours.<br>

The grapling vigor, and rough frowne of Warre<br>

Is cold in amitie, and painted peace,<br>

And our oppression hath made vp this league:<br>

Arme, arme, you heauens, against these periur'd Kings,<br>

A widdow cries, be husband to me (heauens)<br>

Let not the howres of this vngodly day<br>

Weare out the daies in Peace; but ere Sun-set,<br>

Beene sworne my Souldier, bidding me depend<br>

Vpon thy starres, thy fortune, and thy strength,<br>

And dost thou now fall ouer to my foes?<br>

<p id="id10710">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. What earthie name to Interrogatories<br>

Can tast the free breath of a sacred King?<br>

Thou canst not (Cardinall) deuise a name<br>

So slight, vnworthy, and ridiculous<br>

To charge me to an answere, as the Pope:<br>

Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England,<br>

Adde thus much more, that no Italian Priest<br>

Shall tythe or toll in our dominions:<br>

But as we, vnder heauen, are supreame head,<br>

So vnder him that great supremacy<br>

Where we doe reigne, we will alone vphold<br>

Without th' assistance of a mortall hand:<br>

So tell the Pope, all reuerence set apart<br>

To him and his vsurp'd authoritie<br>

<p id="id10711"> Fra. Brother of England, you blaspheme in this</p><br>

Dreading the curse that money may buy out,<br>

And by the merit of vilde gold, drosse, dust,<br>

Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,<br>

Who in that sale sels pardon from himselfe:<br>

Though you, and al the rest so grossely led,<br>

This iugling witchcraft with reuennue cherish,<br>

Yet I alone, alone doe me oppose<br>

Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10713">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pand. Then by the lawfull power that I haue,<br>

Thou shalt stand curst, and excommunicate,<br>

And blessed shall he be that doth reuolt<br>

From his Allegeance to an heretique,<br>

And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,<br>

Canonized and worship'd as a Saint,<br>

That takes away by any secret course<br>

Thy hatefull life<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10714">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. O lawfull let it be<br>

That I haue roome with Rome to curse a while,<br>

Good Father Cardinall, cry thou Amen<br>

To my keene curses; for without my wrong<br>

There is no tongue hath power to curse him right<br>

<p id="id10715"> Pan. There's Law and Warrant (Lady) for my curse</p><br>

Let it be lawfull, that Law barre no wrong:<br>

Law cannot giue my childe his kingdome heere;<br>

For he that holds his Kingdome, holds the Law:<br>

Therefore since Law it selfe is perfect wrong,<br>

How can the Law forbid my tongue to curse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pand. Philip of France, on perill of a curse,<br>

Let goe the hand of that Arch-heretique,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fra. Good reuerend father, make my person yours,<br>

And tell me how you would bestow your selfe?<br>

This royall hand and mine are newly knit,<br>

And the coniunction of our inward soules<br>

Married in league, coupled, and link'd together<br>

With all religous strength of sacred vowes,<br>

The latest breath that gaue the sound of words<br>

Was deepe-sworne faith, peace, amity, true loue<br>

Betweene our kingdomes and our royall selues,<br>

And euen before this truce, but new before,<br>

No longer then we well could wash our hands,<br>

To clap this royall bargaine vp of peace,<br>

Heauen knowes they were besmear'd and ouer-staind<br>

With slaughters pencill; where reuenge did paint<br>

The fearefull difference of incensed kings:<br>

And shall these hands so lately purg'd of bloud?<br>

So newly ioyn'd in loue? so strong in both,<br>

Vnyoke this seysure, and this kinde regreete?<br>

Play fast and loose with faith? so iest with heauen,<br>

Make such vnconstant children of our selues<br>

As now againe to snatch our palme from palme:<br>

Vn-sweare faith sworne, and on the marriage bed<br>

Of smiling peace to march a bloody hoast,<br>

And make a ryot on the gentle brow<br>

Of true sincerity? O holy Sir<br>

My reuerend father, let it not be so;<br>

Out of your grace, deuise, ordaine, impose<br>

Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest<br>

To doe your pleasure, and continue friends<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10733">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pand. All forme is formelesse, Order orderlesse,<br>

Saue what is opposite to Englands loue.<br>

Therefore to Armes, be Champion of our Church,<br>

Or let the Church our mother breathe her curse,<br>

A mothers curse, on her reuolting sonne:<br>

France, thou maist hold a serpent by the tongue,<br>

A cased Lion by the mortall paw,<br>

A fasting Tyger safer by the tooth,<br>

Then keepe in peace that hand which thou dost hold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10734"> Fra. I may dis-ioyne my hand, but not my faith</p><br>

<p id="id10735">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pand. So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith,<br>

And like a ciuill warre setst oath to oath,<br>

Thy tongue against thy tongue. O let thy vow<br>

First made to heauen, first be to heauen perform'd,<br>

That is, to be the Champion of our Church,<br>

What since thou sworst, is sworne against thy selfe,<br>

And may not be performed by thy selfe,<br>

For that which thou hast sworne to doe amisse,<br>

Is not amisse when it is truely done:<br>

And being not done, where doing tends to ill,<br>

The truth is then most done not doing it:<br>

The better Act of purposes mistooke,<br>

Is to mistake again, though indirect,<br>

Yet indirection thereby growes direct,<br>

And falshood, falshood cures, as fire cooles fire<br>

Within the scorched veines of one new burn'd:<br>

It is religion that doth make vowes kept,<br>

But thou hast sworne against religion:<br>

By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,<br>

And mak'st an oath the suretie for thy truth,<br>

Against an oath the truth, thou art vnsure<br>

To sweare, sweares onely not to be forsworne,<br>

Else what a mockerie should it be to sweare?<br>

But thou dost sweare, onely to be forsworne,<br>

And most forsworne, to keepe what thou dost sweare,<br>

Therefore thy later vowes, against thy first,<br>

Is in thy selfe rebellion to thy selfe:<br>

And better conquest neuer canst thou make,<br>

Then arme thy constant and thy nobler parts<br>

Against these giddy loose suggestions:<br>

Vpon which better part, our prayrs come in,<br>

If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know<br>

The perill of our curses light on thee<br>

So heauy, as thou shalt not shake them off<br>

But in despaire, dye vnder their blacke weight<br>

Preach some Philosophy to make me mad,<br>

And thou shalt be Canoniz'd (Cardinall.)<br>

For, being not mad, but sensible of greefe,<br>

My reasonable part produces reason<br>

How I may be deliuer'd of these woes.<br>

And teaches mee to kill or hang my selfe:<br>

If I were mad, I should forget my sonne,<br>

Or madly thinke a babe of clowts were he;<br>

I am not mad: too well, too well I feele<br>

The different plague of each calamitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10795">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fra. Binde vp those tresses: O what loue I note<br>

In the faire multitude of those her haires;<br>

Where but by chance a siluer drop hath falne,<br>

Euen to that drop ten thousand wiery fiends<br>

Doe glew themselues in sociable griefe,<br>

Like true, inseparable, faithfull loues,<br>

Sticking together in calamitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10796"> Con. To England, if you will</p><br>

<p id="id10797"> Fra. Binde vp your haires</p><br>

<p id="id10798">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. Yes that I will: and wherefore will I do it?<br>

I tore them from their bonds, and cride aloud,<br>

O, that these hands could so redeeme my sonne,<br>

As they haue giuen these hayres their libertie:<br>

But now I enuie at their libertie,<br>

And will againe commit them to their bonds,<br>

Because my poore childe is a prisoner.<br>

And Father Cardinall, I haue heard you say<br>

That we shall see and know our friends in heauen:<br>

If that be true, I shall see my boy againe;<br>

For since the birth of Caine, the first male-childe<br>

To him that did but yesterday suspire,<br>

There was not such a gracious creature borne:<br>

But now will Canker-sorrow eat my bud,<br>

And chase the natiue beauty from his cheeke,<br>

And he will looke as hollow as a Ghost,<br>

As dim and meager as an Agues fitte,<br>

And so hee'll dye: and rising so againe,<br>

When I shall meet him in the Court of heauen<br>

I shall not know him: therefore neuer, neuer<br>

Must I behold my pretty Arthur more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10799"> Pand. You hold too heynous a respect of greefe</p><br>

<p id="id10800"> Const. He talkes to me, that neuer had a sonne</p><br>

<p id="id10801"> Fra. You are as fond of greefe, as of your childe</p><br>

<p id="id10802">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Con. Greefe fils the roome vp of my absent childe:<br>

Lies in his bed, walkes vp and downe with me,<br>

Puts on his pretty lookes, repeats his words,<br>

Remembers me of all his gracious parts,<br>

Stuffes out his vacant garments with his forme;<br>

Then, haue I reason to be fond of griefe?<br>

Fareyouwell: had you such a losse as I,<br>

I could giue better comfort then you doe.<br>

I will not keepe this forme vpon my head,<br>

When there is such disorder in my witte:<br>

O Lord, my boy, my Arthur, my faire sonne,<br>

My life, my ioy, my food, my all the world:<br>

My widow-comfort, and my sorrowes cure.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10803">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fra. I feare some out-rage, and Ile follow her.<br>

Enter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10804">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. There's nothing in this world can make me ioy,<br>

Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,<br>

Vexing the dull eare of a drowsie man;<br>

And bitter shame hath spoyl'd the sweet words taste,<br>

That it yeelds nought but shame and bitternesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10805">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pand. Before the curing of a strong disease,<br>

Euen in the instant of repaire and health,<br>

The fit is strongest: Euils that take leaue<br>

On their departure, most of all shew euill:<br>

What haue you lost by losing of this day?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. All daies of glory, ioy, and happinesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10806">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan. If you had won it, certainely you had.<br>

No, no: when Fortune meanes to men most good,<br>

Shee lookes vpon them with a threatning eye:<br>

'Tis strange to thinke how much King Iohn hath lost<br>

In this which he accounts so clearely wonne:<br>

Are not you grieu'd that Arthur is his prisoner?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. As heartily as he is glad he hath him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10807">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan. Your minde is all as youthfull as your blood.<br>

Now heare me speake with a propheticke spirit:<br>

For euen the breath of what I meane to speake,<br>

Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub<br>

Out of the path which shall directly lead<br>

Thy foote to Englands Throne. And therefore marke:<br>

Iohn hath seiz'd Arthur, and it cannot be,<br>

That whiles warme life playes in that infants veines,<br>

The mis-plac'dIohn should entertaine an houre,<br>

One minute, nay one quiet breath of rest.<br>

A Scepter snatch'd with an vnruly hand,<br>

Must be as boysterously maintain'd as gain'd.<br>

And he that stands vpon a slipp'ry place,<br>

Makes nice of no vilde hold to stay him vp:<br>

That Iohn may stand, then Arthur needs must fall,<br>

So be it, for it cannot be but so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10808">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. But what shall I gaine by yong Arthurs fall?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,<br>

May then make all the claime that Arthur did<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10809"> Dol. And loose it, life and all, as Arthur did</p><br>

<p id="id10810">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan. How green you are, and fresh in this old world?<br>

Iohn layes you plots: the times conspire with you,<br>

For he that steepes his safetie in true blood,<br>

Shall finde but bloodie safety, and vntrue.<br>

This Act so euilly borne shall coole the hearts<br>

Of all his people, and freeze vp their zeale,<br>

That none so small aduantage shall step forth<br>

To checke his reigne, but they will cherish it.<br>

No naturall exhalation in the skie,<br>

No scope of Nature, no distemper'd day,<br>

No common winde, no customed euent,<br>

But they will plucke away his naturall cause,<br>

And call them Meteors, prodigies, and signes,<br>

Abbortiues, presages, and tongues of heauen,<br>

Plainly denouncing vengeance vpon Iohn<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10811">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. May be he will not touch yong Arthurs life,<br>

But hold himselfe safe in his prisonment<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan. O Sir, when he shall heare of your approach,<br>

If that yong Arthur be not gone alreadie,<br>

Euen at that newes he dies: and then the hearts<br>

Of all his people shall reuolt from him,<br>

And kisse the lippes of vnacquainted change,<br>

And picke strong matter of reuolt, and wrath<br>

Out of the bloody fingers ends of Iohn.<br>

Me thinkes I see this hurley all on foot;<br>

And O, what better matter breeds for you,<br>

Then I haue nam'd. The Bastard Falconbridge<br>

Is now in England ransacking the Church,<br>

Offending Charity: If but a dozen French<br>

Were there in Armes, they would be as a Call<br>

To traine ten thousand English to their side;<br>

Or, as a little snow, tumbled about,<br>

Anon becomes a Mountaine. O noble Dolphine,<br>

Go with me to the King, 'tis wonderfull,<br>

What may be wrought out of their discontent,<br>

Now that their soules are topfull of offence,<br>

For England go; I will whet on the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. Strong reasons makes strange actions: let vs go,<br>

If you say I, the King will not say no.<br>

Yet I remember, when I was in France,<br>

Yong Gentlemen would be as sad as night<br>

Onely for wantonnesse: by my Christendome,<br>

So I were out of prison, and kept Sheepe<br>

I should be as merry as the day is long:<br>

And so I would be heere, but that I doubt<br>

My Vnckle practises more harme to me:<br>

He is affraid of me, and I of him:<br>

Is it my fault, that I was Geffreyes sonne?<br>

No in deede is't not: and I would to heauen<br>

I were your sonne, so you would loue me, Hubert:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. If I talke to him, with his innocent prate<br>

He will awake my mercie, which lies dead:<br>

Therefore I will be sodaine, and dispatch<br>

<p id="id10825">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Are you sicke Hubert? you looke pale to day,<br>

Insooth I would you were a little sicke,<br>

That I might sit all night, and watch with you.<br>

I warrant I loue you more then you do me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10826">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. His words do take possession of my bosome.<br>

Reade heere yong Arthur. How now foolish rheume?<br>

Turning dispitious torture out of doore?<br>

I must be breefe, least resolution drop<br>

Out at mine eyes, in tender womanish teares.<br>

Can you not reade it? Is it not faire writ?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Too fairely Hubert, for so foule effect,<br>

Must you with hot Irons, burne out both mine eyes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Yong Boy, I must<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. And I will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10828">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. Haue you the heart? When your head did but<br>

ake,<br>

I knit my hand-kercher about your browes<br>

(The best I had, a Princesse wrought it me)<br>

And I did neuer aske it you againe:<br>

And with my hand, at midnight held your head;<br>

And like the watchfull minutes, to the houre,<br>

Still and anon cheer'd vp the heauy time;<br>

Saying, what lacke you? and where lies your greefe?<br>

Or what good loue may I performe for you?<br>

Many a poore mans sonne would haue lyen still,<br>

And nere haue spoke a louing word to you:<br>

But you, at your sicke seruice had a Prince:<br>

Nay, you may thinke my loue was craftie loue,<br>

And call it cunning. Do, and if you will,<br>

If heauen be pleas'd that you must vse me ill,<br>

Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?<br>

These eyes, that neuer did, nor neuer shall<br>

So much as frowne on you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10829">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. I haue sworne to do it:<br>

And with hot Irons must I burne them out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10830">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Ah, none but in this Iron Age, would do it:<br>

The Iron of it selfe, though heate red hot,<br>

Approaching neere these eyes, would drinke my teares,<br>

And quench this fierie indignation,<br>

Euen in the matter of mine innocence:<br>

Nay, after that, consume away in rust,<br>

But for containing fire to harme mine eye:<br>

Are you more stubborne hard, then hammer'd Iron?<br>

And if an Angell should haue come to me,<br>

And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,<br>

I would not haue beleeu'd him: no tongue but Huberts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10831"> Hub. Come forth: Do as I bid you do</p><br>

<p id="id10832">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. O saue me Hubert, saue me: my eyes are out<br>

Euen with the fierce lookes of these bloody men<br>

<p id="id10833"> Hub. Giue me the Iron I say, and binde him heere</p><br>

<p id="id10834">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. Alas, what neede you be so boistrous rough?<br>

I will not struggle, I will stand stone still:<br>

For heauen sake Hubert let me not be bound:<br>

Nay heare me Hubert, driue these men away,<br>

And I will sit as quiet as a Lambe.<br>

I will not stirre, nor winch, nor speake a word,<br>

Nor looke vpon the Iron angerly:<br>

Thrust but these men away, and Ile forgiue you,<br>

What euer torment you do put me too<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10835"> Hub. Go stand within: let me alone with him</p><br>

<p id="id10836"> Exec. I am best pleas'd to be from such a deede</p><br>

<p id="id10837">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. Alas, I then haue chid away my friend,<br>

He hath a sterne looke, but a gentle heart:<br>

Let him come backe, that his compassion may<br>

Giue life to yours<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10838"> Hub. Come (Boy) prepare your selfe</p><br>

<p id="id10839">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. Is there no remedie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. None, but to lose your eyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10840">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. O heauen: that there were but a moth in yours,<br>

A graine, a dust, a gnat, a wandering haire,<br>

Any annoyance in that precious sense:<br>

Then feeling what small things are boysterous there,<br>

Your vilde intent must needs seeme horrible<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10841"> Hub. Is this your promise? Go too, hold your toong</p><br>

<p id="id10842">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. Hubert, the vtterance of a brace of tongues,<br>

Must needes want pleading for a paire of eyes:<br>

Let me not hold my tongue: let me not Hubert,<br>

Or Hubert, if you will cut out my tongue,<br>

So I may keepe mine eyes. O spare mine eyes,<br>

Though to no vse, but still to looke on you.<br>

Loe, by my troth, the Instrument is cold,<br>

And would not harme me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10843"> Hub. I can heate it, Boy</p><br>

<p id="id10844">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with griefe,<br>

Being create for comfort, to be vs'd<br>

In vndeserued extreames: See else your selfe,<br>

There is no malice in this burning cole,<br>

The breath of heauen, hath blowne his spirit out,<br>

And strew'd repentant ashes on his head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10845"> Hub. But with my breath I can reuiue it Boy</p><br>

<p id="id10846">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. And if you do, you will but make it blush,<br>

And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:<br>

Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes:<br>

And, like a dogge that is compell'd to fight,<br>

Snatch at his Master that doth tarre him on.<br>

All things that you should vse to do me wrong<br>

Deny their office: onely you do lacke<br>

That mercie, which fierce fire, and Iron extends,<br>

Creatures of note for mercy, lacking vses<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10847">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Well, see to liue: I will not touch thine eye,<br>

For all the Treasure that thine Vnckle owes,<br>

Yet am I sworne, and I did purpose, Boy,<br>

With this same very Iron, to burne them out<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10848">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. O now you looke like Hubert. All this while<br>

You were disguis'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10849">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Peace: no more. Adieu,<br>

Your Vnckle must not know but you are dead.<br>

Ile fill these dogged Spies with false reports:<br>

And, pretty childe, sleepe doubtlesse, and secure,<br>

That Hubert for the wealth of all the world,<br>

Will not offend thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10850"> Art. O heauen! I thanke you Hubert</p><br>

<p id="id10851">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Silence, no more; go closely in with mee,<br>

Much danger do I vndergo for thee.<br>

<p id="id10854">Enter Iohn, Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lordes.</p><br>

And look'd vpon, I hope, with chearefull eyes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10856">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. This once again (but that your Highnes pleas'd)<br>

Was once superfluous: you were Crown'd before,<br>

And that high Royalty was nere pluck'd off:<br>

The faiths of men, nere stained with reuolt:<br>

Fresh expectation troubled not the Land<br>

With any long'd-for-change, or better State<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10857">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Therefore, to be possess'd with double pompe,<br>

To guard a Title, that was rich before;<br>

To gilde refined Gold, to paint the Lilly;<br>

To throw a perfume on the Violet,<br>

To smooth the yce, or adde another hew<br>

Vnto the Raine-bow; or with Taper-light<br>

To seeke the beauteous eye of heauen to garnish,<br>

Is wastefull, and ridiculous excesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10858">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. But that your Royall pleasure must be done,<br>

This acte, is as an ancient tale new told,<br>

And, in the last repeating, troublesome,<br>

Being vrged at a time vnseasonable<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10859">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. In this the Anticke, and well noted face<br>

Of plaine old forme, is much disfigured,<br>

And like a shifted winde vnto a saile,<br>

It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,<br>

Startles, and frights consideration:<br>

Makes sound opinion sicke, and truth suspected,<br>

For putting on so new a fashion'd robe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10860">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. When Workemen striue to do better then wel,<br>

They do confound their skill in couetousnesse,<br>

And oftentimes excusing of a fault,<br>

Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse:<br>

As patches set vpon a little breach,<br>

Discredite more in hiding of the fault,<br>

Then did the fault before it was so patch'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10861">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. To this effect, before you were new crown'd<br>

We breath'd our Councell: but it pleas'd your Highnes<br>

To ouer-beare it, and we are all well pleas'd,<br>

Since all, and euery part of what we would<br>

Doth make a stand, at what your Highnesse will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10862">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Some reasons of this double Corronation<br>

I haue possest you with, and thinke them strong.<br>

And more, more strong, then lesser is my feare<br>

I shall indue you with: Meane time, but aske<br>

What you would haue reform'd, that is not well,<br>

And well shall you perceiue, how willingly<br>

I will both heare, and grant you your requests<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10863">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these<br>

To sound the purposes of all their hearts,<br>

Both for my selfe, and them: but chiefe of all<br>

Your safety: for the which, my selfe and them<br>

Bend their best studies, heartily request<br>

Th' infranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint<br>

Doth moue the murmuring lips of discontent<br>

To breake into this dangerous argument.<br>

If what in rest you haue, in right you hold,<br>

Why then your feares, which (as they say) attend<br>

The steppes of wrong, should moue you to mew vp<br>

Your tender kinsman, and to choake his dayes<br>

With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth<br>

The rich aduantage of good exercise,<br>

That the times enemies may not haue this<br>

To grace occasions: let it be our suite,<br>

That you haue bid vs aske his libertie,<br>

Which for our goods, we do no further aske,<br>

Then, whereupon our weale on you depending,<br>

Counts it your weale: he haue his liberty.<br>

Enter Hubert.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10864">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Let it be so: I do commit his youth<br>

To your direction: Hubert, what newes with you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. This is the man should do the bloody deed:<br>

He shew'd his warrant to a friend of mine,<br>

The image of a wicked heynous fault<br>

Liues in his eye: that close aspect of his,<br>

Do shew the mood of a much troubled brest,<br>

And I do fearefully beleeue 'tis done,<br>

What we so fear'd he had a charge to do<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10865">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. The colour of the King doth come, and go<br>

Betweene his purpose and his conscience,<br>

Like Heralds 'twixt two dreadfull battailes set:<br>

His passion is so ripe, it needs must breake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10866">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. And when it breakes, I feare will issue thence<br>

The foule corruption of a sweet childes death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10867">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. We cannot hold mortalities strong hand.<br>

Good Lords, although my will to giue, is liuing,<br>

The suite which you demand is gone, and dead.<br>

He tels vs Arthur is deceas'd to night<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10868"> Sal. Indeed we fear'd his sicknesse was past cure</p><br>

<p id="id10869">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. Indeed we heard how neere his death he was,<br>

Before the childe himselfe felt he was sicke:<br>

This must be answer'd either heere, or hence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10870">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Why do you bend such solemne browes on me?<br>

Thinke you I beare the Sheeres of destiny?<br>

Haue I commandement on the pulse of life?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. It is apparant foule-play, and 'tis shame<br>

That Greatnesse should so grossely offer it;<br>

So thriue it in your game, and so farewell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10871">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. Stay yet (Lord Salisbury) Ile go with thee,<br>

And finde th' inheritance of this poore childe,<br>

His little kingdome of a forced graue.<br>

That blood which ow'd the bredth of all this Ile,<br>

Three foot of it doth hold; bad world the while:<br>

This must not be thus borne, this will breake out<br>

To all our sorrowes, and ere long I doubt.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10872">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id10874">There is no sure foundation set on blood:<br>

No certaine life atchieu'd by others death:<br>

So foule a skie, cleeres not without a storme,<br>

Poure downe thy weather: how goes all in France?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. From France to England, neuer such a powre<br>

For when you should be told they do prepare,<br>

The tydings comes, that they are all arriu'd<br>

<p id="id10875">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Oh where hath our Intelligence bin drunke?<br>

Where hath it slept? Where is my Mothers care?<br>

That such an Army could be drawne in France,<br>

And she not heare of it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. My Liege, her eare<br>

Your noble mother; and as I heare, my Lord,<br>

The Lady Constance in a frenzie di'de<br>

Three dayes before: but this from Rumors tongue<br>

I idely heard: if true, or false I know not<br>

<p id="id10876">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. With-hold thy speed, dreadfull Occasion:<br>

O make a league with me, 'till I haue pleas'd<br>

My discontented Peeres. What? Mother dead?<br>

How wildely then walkes my Estate in France?<br>

Vnder whose conduct came those powres of France,<br>

That thou for truth giu'st out are landed heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. Vnder the Dolphin.<br>

Enter Bastard and Peter of Pomfret.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10877">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Thou hast made me giddy<br>

With these ill tydings: Now? What sayes the world<br>

To your proceedings? Do not seeke to stuffe<br>

My head with more ill newes: for it is full<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10878">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. But if you be a-feard to heare the worst,<br>

Then let the worst vn-heard, fall on your head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10879">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Beare with me Cosen, for I was amaz'd<br>

Vnder the tide; but now I breath againe<br>

Aloft the flood, and can giue audience<br>

To any tongue, speake it of what it will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10880">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. How I haue sped among the Clergy men,<br>

The summes I haue collected shall expresse:<br>

But as I trauail'd hither through the land,<br>

I finde the people strangely fantasied,<br>

Possest with rumors, full of idle dreames,<br>

Not knowing what they feare, but full of feare.<br>

And here's a Prophet that I brought with me<br>

From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found<br>

With many hundreds treading on his heeles:<br>

To whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rimes,<br>

That ere the next Ascension day at noone,<br>

Your Highnes should deliuer vp your Crowne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10881">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Thou idle Dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet. Fore-knowing that the truth will fall out so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10882">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Hubert, away with him: imprison him,<br>

And on that day at noone, whereon he sayes<br>

I shall yeeld vp my Crowne, let him be hang'd<br>

Deliuer him to safety, and returne,<br>

For I must vse thee. O my gentle Cosen,<br>

Hear'st thou the newes abroad, who are arriu'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. The French (my Lord) mens mouths are ful of it:<br>

Besides I met Lord Bigot, and Lord Salisburie<br>

With eyes as red as new enkindled fire,<br>

And others more, going to seeke the graue<br>

Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to night, on your suggestion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10883">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Gentle kinsman, go<br>

And thrust thy selfe into their Companies,<br>

I haue a way to winne their loues againe:<br>

Bring them before me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10884"> Bast. I will seeke them out</p><br>

<p id="id10885">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Nay, but make haste: the better foote before.<br>

O, let me haue no subiect enemies,<br>

When aduerse Forreyners affright my Townes<br>

With dreadfull pompe of stout inuasion.<br>

Be Mercurie, set feathers to thy heeles,<br>

And flye (like thought) from them, to me againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10886"> Bast. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.</p><br>

<p id="id10887">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id10888">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Spoke like a sprightfull Noble Gentleman.<br>

Go after him: for he perhaps shall neede<br>

Some Messenger betwixt me, and the Peeres,<br>

And be thou hee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10889"> Mes. With all my heart, my Liege</p><br>

<p id="id10890">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. My mother dead?<br>

Enter Hubert.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10891">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. My Lord, they say fiue Moones were seene to night:<br>

Foure fixed, and the fift did whirle about<br>

The other foure, in wondrous motion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10892">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Fiue Moones?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Old men, and Beldames, in the streets<br>

Do prophesie vpon it dangerously:<br>

Yong Arthurs death is common in their mouths,<br>

And when they talke of him, they shake their heads,<br>

And whisper one another in the eare.<br>

And he that speakes, doth gripe the hearers wrist,<br>

Whilst he that heares, makes fearefull action<br>

With wrinkled browes, with nods, with rolling eyes.<br>

I saw a Smith stand with his hammer (thus)<br>

The whilst his Iron did on the Anuile coole,<br>

With open mouth swallowing a Taylors newes,<br>

Who with his Sheeres, and Measure in his hand,<br>

Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste<br>

Had falsely thrust vpon contrary feete,<br>

Told of a many thousand warlike French,<br>

That were embattailed, and rank'd in Kent.<br>

Another leane, vnwash'd Artificer,<br>

Cuts off his tale, and talkes of Arthurs death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10893">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io. Why seek'st thou to possesse me with these feares?<br>

Why vrgest thou so oft yong Arthurs death?<br>

Thy hand hath murdred him: I had a mighty cause<br>

To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10894">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. No had (my Lord?) why, did you not prouoke me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. It is the curse of Kings, to be attended<br>

By slaues, that take their humors for a warrant,<br>

To breake within the bloody house of life,<br>

And on the winking of Authoritie<br>

To vnderstand a Law; to know the meaning<br>

Of dangerous Maiesty, when perchance it frownes<br>

More vpon humor, then aduis'd respect<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10895"> Hub. Heere is your hand and Seale for what I did</p><br>

<p id="id10896">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Oh, when the last accompt twixt heauen &amp; earth<br>

Is to be made, then shall this hand and Seale<br>

Witnesse against vs to damnation.<br>

How oft the sight of meanes to do ill deeds,<br>

Make deeds ill done? Had'st not thou beene by,<br>

A fellow by the hand of Nature mark'd,<br>

Quoted, and sign'd to do a deede of shame,<br>

This murther had not come into my minde.<br>

But taking note of thy abhorr'd Aspect,<br>

Finding thee fit for bloody villanie:<br>

Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,<br>

I faintly broke with thee of Arthurs death:<br>

And thou, to be endeered to a King,<br>

Made it no conscience to destroy a Prince<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10897"> Hub. My Lord</p><br>

<p id="id10898">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioh. Had'st thou but shooke thy head, or made a pause<br>

When I spake darkely, what I purposed:<br>

Or turn'd an eye of doubt vpon my face;<br>

As bid me tell my tale in expresse words:<br>

Deepe shame had struck me dumbe, made me break off,<br>

And those thy feares, might haue wrought feares in me.<br>

But, thou didst vnderstand me by my signes,<br>

And didst in signes againe parley with sinne,<br>

Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,<br>

And consequently, thy rude hand to acte<br>

The deed, which both our tongues held vilde to name.<br>

Out of my sight, and neuer see me more:<br>

My Nobles leaue me, and my State is braued,<br>

Euen at my gates, with rankes of forraigne powres;<br>

Nay, in the body of this fleshly Land,<br>

This kingdome, this Confine of blood, and breathe<br>

Hostilitie, and ciuill tumult reignes<br>

Betweene my conscience, and my Cosins death<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10899">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Arme you against your other enemies:<br>

Ile make a peace betweene your soule, and you.<br>

Yong Arthur is aliue: This hand of mine<br>

Is yet a maiden, and an innocent hand.<br>

Not painted with the Crimson spots of blood,<br>

Within this bosome, neuer entred yet<br>

The dreadfull motion of a murderous thought,<br>

And you haue slander'd Nature in my forme,<br>

Which howsoeuer rude exteriorly,<br>

Is yet the couer of a fayrer minde,<br>

Then to be butcher of an innocent childe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10900">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Doth Arthur liue? O hast thee to the Peeres,<br>

Throw this report on their incensed rage,<br>

And make them tame to their obedience.<br>

Forgiue the Comment that my passion made<br>

Vpon thy feature, for my rage was blinde,<br>

And foule immaginarie eyes of blood<br>

Presented thee more hideous then thou art.<br>

Oh, answer not; but to my Closset bring<br>

The angry Lords, with all expedient hast,<br>

I coniure thee but slowly: run more fast.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10901">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id10903">Enter Arthur on the walles.</p><br>

<p id="id10904">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. The Wall is high, and yet will I leape downe.<br>

Good ground be pittifull, and hurt me not:<br>

There's few or none do know me, if they did,<br>

This Ship-boyes semblance hath disguis'd me quite.<br>

I am afraide, and yet Ile venture it.<br>

If I get downe, and do not breake my limbes,<br>

Ile finde a thousand shifts to get away;<br>

As good to dye, and go; as dye, and stay.<br>

Oh me, my Vnckles spirit is in these stones,<br>

Heauen take my soule, and England keep my bones.<br>

<p id="id10905">Dies</p><br>

<p id="id10907">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Lords, I will meet him at S[aint]. Edmondsbury,<br>

It is our safetie, and we must embrace<br>

This gentle offer of the perillous time<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10908">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. Who brought that Letter from the Cardinall?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. The Count Meloone, a Noble Lord of France,<br>

Whose priuate with me of the Dolphines loue,<br>

Is much more generall, then these lines import<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10909"> Big. To morrow morning let vs meete him then</p><br>

<p id="id10910">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Or rather then set forward, for 'twill be<br>

Two long dayes iourney (Lords) or ere we meete.<br>

Enter Bastard.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10911">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Once more to day well met, distemper'd Lords,<br>

The King by me requests your presence straight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10912">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. The king hath dispossest himselfe of vs,<br>

We will not lyne his thin-bestained cloake<br>

With our pure Honors: nor attend the foote<br>

That leaues the print of blood where ere it walkes.<br>

Returne, and tell him so: we know the worst<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10913">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. What ere you thinke, good words I thinke<br>

were best<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10914"> Sal. Our greefes, and not our manners reason now</p><br>

<p id="id10915">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. But there is little reason in your greefe.<br>

Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10916"> Pem. Sir, sir, impatience hath his priuiledge</p><br>

The earth had not a hole to hide this deede<br>

<p id="id10919">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Murther, as hating what himselfe hath done,<br>

Doth lay it open to vrge on reuenge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10920">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big. Or when he doom'd this Beautie to a graue,<br>

Found it too precious Princely, for a graue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10921">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Sir Richard, what thinke you? you haue beheld,<br>

Or haue you read, or heard, or could you thinke?<br>

Or do you almost thinke, although you see,<br>

That you do see? Could thought, without this obiect<br>

Forme such another? This is the very top,<br>

The heighth, the Crest: or Crest vnto the Crest<br>

Of murthers Armes: This is the bloodiest shame,<br>

The wildest Sauagery, the vildest stroke<br>

That euer wall-ey'd wrath, or staring rage<br>

Presented to the teares of soft remorse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10922">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. All murthers past, do stand excus'd in this:<br>

And this so sole, and so vnmatcheable,<br>

Shall giue a holinesse, a puritie,<br>

To the yet vnbegotten sinne of times;<br>

And proue a deadly bloodshed, but a iest,<br>

Exampled by this heynous spectacle<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10923">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. It is a damned, and a bloody worke,<br>

The gracelesse action of a heauy hand,<br>

If that it be the worke of any hand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10924">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. If that it be the worke of any hand?<br>

We had a kinde of light, what would ensue:<br>

It is the shamefull worke of Huberts hand,<br>

The practice, and the purpose of the king:<br>

From whose obedience I forbid my soule,<br>

Kneeling before this ruine of sweete life,<br>

And breathing to his breathlesse Excellence<br>

The Incense of a Vow, a holy Vow:<br>

Neuer to taste the pleasures of the world,<br>

Neuer to be infected with delight,<br>

Nor conuersant with Ease, and Idlenesse,<br>

Till I haue set a glory to this hand,<br>

By giuing it the worship of Reuenge<br>

<p id="id10925">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pem. Big. Our soules religiously confirme thy words.<br>

Enter Hubert.<br>

<p id="id10926">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Lords, I am hot with haste, in seeking you,<br>

Arthur doth liue, the king hath sent for you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10927">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Oh he is bold, and blushes not at death,<br>

Auant thou hatefull villain, get thee gone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10928"> Hu. I am no villaine</p><br>

<p id="id10929">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Must I rob the Law?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Your sword is bright sir, put it vp againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10930"> Sal. Not till I sheath it in a murtherers skin</p><br>

<p id="id10931">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Stand backe Lord Salsbury, stand backe I say<br>

By heauen, I thinke my sword's as sharpe as yours.<br>

I would not haue you (Lord) forget your selfe,<br>

Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;<br>

Least I, by marking of your rage, forget<br>

Your Worth, your Greatnesse, and Nobility<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10932">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big. Out dunghill: dar'st thou braue a Nobleman?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Not for my life: But yet I dare defend<br>

My innocent life against an Emperor<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10933"> Sal. Thou art a Murtherer</p><br>

<p id="id10934">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Do not proue me so:<br>

Yet I am none. Whose tongue so ere speakes false,<br>

Not truely speakes: who speakes not truly, Lies<br>

<p id="id10937"> Sal. Stand by, or I shall gaul you Faulconbridge</p><br>

<p id="id10938">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Thou wer't better gaul the diuell Salsbury.<br>

If thou but frowne on me, or stirre thy foote,<br>

Or teach thy hastie spleene to do me shame,<br>

Ile strike thee dead. Put vp thy sword betime,<br>

Or Ile so maule you, and your tosting-Iron,<br>

That you shall thinke the diuell is come from hell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10939">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big. What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?<br>

Second a Villaine, and a Murtherer?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. Lord Bigot, I am none<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10940">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big. Who kill'd this Prince?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. 'Tis not an houre since I left him well:<br>

I honour'd him, I lou'd him, and will weepe<br>

My date of life out, for his sweete liues losse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10941">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,<br>

For villanie is not without such rheume,<br>

And he, long traded in it, makes it seeme<br>

Like Riuers of remorse and innocencie.<br>

Away with me, all you whose soules abhorre<br>

Th' vncleanly sauours of a Slaughter-house,<br>

For I am stifled with this smell of sinne<br>

Beyond the infinite and boundlesse reach of mercie,<br>

<p id="id10946"> Hub. Do but heare me sir</p><br>

<p id="id10947">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Ha? Ile tell thee what.<br>

Thou'rt damn'd as blacke, nay nothing is so blacke,<br>

Thou art more deepe damn'd then Prince Lucifer:<br>

There is not yet so vgly a fiend of hell<br>

As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this childe<br>

<p id="id10948"> Hub. Vpon my soule</p><br>

To this most cruell Act: do but dispaire,<br>

And if thou want'st a Cord, the smallest thred<br>

That euer Spider twisted from her wombe<br>

Will serue to strangle thee: A rush will be a beame<br>

To hang thee on. Or wouldst thou drowne thy selfe,<br>

Put but a little water in a spoone,<br>

And it shall be as all the Ocean,<br>

Enough to stifle such a villaine vp.<br>

I do suspect thee very greeuously<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id10950">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub. If I in act, consent, or sinne of thought,<br>

Be guiltie of the stealing that sweete breath<br>

Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,<br>

Let hell want paines enough to torture me:<br>

I left him well<br>

<p id="id10951">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Go, beare him in thine armes:<br>

I am amaz'd me thinkes, and loose my way<br>

Among the thornes, and dangers of this world.<br>

How easie dost thou take all England vp,<br>

From forth this morcell of dead Royaltie?<br>

The life, the right, and truth of all this Realme<br>

Is fled to heauen: and England now is left<br>

To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth<br>

The vn-owed interest of proud swelling State:<br>

Now for the bare-pickt bone of Maiesty,<br>

Doth dogged warre bristle his angry crest,<br>

And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:<br>

Now Powers from home, and discontents at home<br>

Meet in one line: and vast confusion waites<br>

As doth a Rauen on a sicke-falne beast,<br>

The iminent decay of wrested pompe.<br>

Now happy he, whose cloake and center can<br>

Hold out this tempest. Beare away that childe,<br>

And follow me with speed: Ile to the King:<br>

My Liege, my Lord: but now a King, now thus<br>

<p id="id11050">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hen. Euen so must I run on, and euen so stop.<br>

What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,<br>

When this was now a King, and now is clay?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behinde,<br>

To do the office for thee, of reuenge,<br>

And then my soule shall waite on thee to heauen,<br>

As it on earth hath bene thy seruant still.<br>

Now, now you Starres, that moue in your right spheres,<br>

Where be your powres? Shew now your mended faiths,<br>

And instantly returne with me againe.<br>

To push destruction, and perpetuall shame<br>

Out of the weake doore of our fainting Land:<br>

Straight let vs seeke, or straight we shall be sought,<br>

The Cardinall Pandulph is within at rest,<br>

Who halfe an houre since came from the Dolphin,<br>

And brings from him such offers of our peace,<br>

As we with honor and respect may take,<br>

With purpose presently to leaue this warre<br>

<p id="id11052">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. He will the rather do it, when he sees<br>

Our selues well sinew'd to our defence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11053">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal. Nay, 'tis in a manner done already,<br>

For many carriages hee hath dispatch'd<br>

To the sea side, and put his cause and quarrell<br>

To the disposing of the Cardinall,<br>

With whom your selfe, my selfe, and other Lords,<br>

If you thinke meete, this afternoone will poast<br>

To consummate this businesse happily<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11054">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Let it be so, and you my noble Prince,<br>

With other Princes that may best be spar'd,<br>

Shall waite vpon your Fathers Funerall<br>

For so he will'd it<br>

And happily may your sweet selfe put on<br>

The lineall state, and glorie of the Land,<br>

To whom with all submission on my knee,<br>

I do bequeath my faithfull seruices<br>

And true subiection euerlastingly<br>

To rest without a spot for euermore<br>

<p id="id11058">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hen. I haue a kinde soule, that would giue thankes,<br>

And knowes not how to do it, but with teares<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11059">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bast. Oh let vs pay the time: but needfull woe,<br>

Since it hath beene before hand with our greefes.<br>

This England neuer did, nor neuer shall<br>

Lye at the proud foote of a Conqueror,<br>

But when it first did helpe to wound it selfe.<br>

Now, these her Princes are come home againe,<br>

Come the three corners of the world in Armes,<br>

And we shall shocke them: Naught shall make vs rue,<br>

In the deuotion of a subiects loue,<br>

Tendering the precious safetie of my Prince,<br>

And free from other misbegotten hate,<br>

Come I appealant to this Princely presence.<br>

Now Thomas Mowbray do I turne to thee,<br>

And marke my greeting well: for what I speake,<br>

My body shall make good vpon this earth,<br>

Or my diuine soule answer it in heauen.<br>

Thou art a Traitor, and a Miscreant;<br>

Too good to be so, and too bad to liue,<br>

Since the more faire and christall is the skie,<br>

The vglier seeme the cloudes that in it flye:<br>

Once more, the more to aggrauate the note,<br>

With a foule Traitors name stuffe I thy throte,<br>

And wish (so please my Soueraigne) ere I moue,<br>

What my tong speaks, my right drawn sword may proue<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Let not my cold words heere accuse my zeale:<br>

'Tis not the triall of a Womans warre,<br>

The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,<br>

Can arbitrate this cause betwixt vs twaine:<br>

The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this.<br>

Yet can I not of such tame patience boast,<br>

As to be husht, and nought at all to say.<br>

First the faire reuerence of your Highnesse curbes mee,<br>

From giuing reines and spurres to my free speech,<br>

Which else would post, vntill it had return'd<br>

These tearmes of treason, doubly downe his throat.<br>

Setting aside his high bloods royalty,<br>

And let him be no Kinsman to my Liege,<br>

I do defie him, and I spit at him,<br>

Call him a slanderous Coward, and a Villaine:<br>

Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes,<br>

And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote,<br>

Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,<br>

Or any other ground inhabitable,<br>

Where euer Englishman durst set his foote.<br>

And lay aside my high bloods Royalty,<br>

Which feare, not reuerence makes thee to except.<br>

If guilty dread hath left thee so much strength,<br>

As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then stoope.<br>

By that, and all the rites of Knight-hood else,<br>

Will I make good against thee arme to arme,<br>

What I haue spoken, or thou canst deuise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11073">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. I take it vp, and by that sword I sweare,<br>

Which gently laid my Knight-hood on my shoulder,<br>

Ile answer thee in any faire degree,<br>

Or Chiualrous designe of knightly triall:<br>

And when I mount, aliue may I not light,<br>

If I be Traitor, or vniustly fight<br>

It must be great that can inherite vs,<br>

So much as of a thought of ill in him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11075">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. Looke what I said, my life shall proue it true,<br>

That Mowbray hath receiu'd eight thousand Nobles,<br>

In name of lendings for your Highnesse Soldiers,<br>

The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,<br>

Like a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine.<br>

Besides I say, and will in battaile proue,<br>

Or heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge<br>

That euer was suruey'd by English eye,<br>

That all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres<br>

Complotted, and contriued in this Land,<br>

Fetch'd from false Mowbray their first head and spring.<br>

Further I say, and further will maintaine<br>

Vpon his bad life, to make all this good.<br>

That he did plot the Duke of Glousters death,<br>

Suggest his soone beleeuing aduersaries,<br>

And consequently, like a Traitor Coward,<br>

Sluc'd out his innocent soule through streames of blood:<br>

Which blood, like sacrificing Abels cries,<br>

(Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth)<br>

To me for iustice, and rough chasticement:<br>

And by the glorious worth of my discent,<br>

This arme shall do it, or this life be spent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11076">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. How high a pitch his resolution soares:<br>

Thomas of Norfolke, what sayest thou to this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face,<br>

And bid his eares a little while be deafe,<br>

Till I haue told this slander of his blood,<br>

How God, and good men, hate so foule a lyar<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11077">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Mowbray, impartiall are our eyes and eares,<br>

Were he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre,<br>

As he is but my fathers brothers sonne;<br>

Now by my Scepters awe, I make a vow,<br>

Such neighbour-neerenesse to our sacred blood,<br>

Should nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize<br>

The vn-stooping firmenesse of my vpright soule.<br>

He is our subiect (Mowbray) so art thou,<br>

Free speech, and fearelesse, I to thee allow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11078">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Then Bullingbrooke, as low as to thy heart,<br>

Through the false passage of thy throat; thou lyest:<br>

Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice,<br>

Disburst I to his Highnesse souldiers;<br>

The other part reseru'd I by consent,<br>

For that my Soueraigne Liege was in my debt,<br>

Vpon remainder of a deere Accompt,<br>

Since last I went to France to fetch his Queene:<br>

Now swallow downe that Lye. For Glousters death,<br>

I slew him not; but (to mine owne disgrace)<br>

Neglected my sworne duty in that case:<br>

For you my noble Lord of Lancaster,<br>

The honourable Father to my foe,<br>

Once I did lay an ambush for your life,<br>

A trespasse that doth vex my greeued soule:<br>

But ere I last receiu'd the Sacrament,<br>

I did confesse it, and exactly begg'd<br>

Your Graces pardon, and I hope I had it.<br>

This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd,<br>

It issues from the rancour of a Villaine,<br>

A recreant, and most degenerate Traitor,<br>

Which in my selfe I boldly will defend,<br>

And interchangeably hurle downe my gage<br>

Vpon this ouer-weening Traitors foote,<br>

Despight of death, that liues vpon my graue<br>

To darke dishonours vse, thou shalt not haue.<br>

I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffel'd heere,<br>

Pierc'd to the soule with slanders venom'd speare:<br>

The which no balme can cure, but his heart blood<br>

Which breath'd this poyson<br>

<p id="id11085">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Rage must be withstood:<br>

Giue me his gage: Lyons make Leopards tame<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11086">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo. Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame,<br>

And I resigne my gage. My deere, deere Lord,<br>

The purest treasure mortall times afford<br>

Is spotlesse reputation: that away,<br>

Men are but gilded loame, or painted clay.<br>

A Iewell in a ten times barr'd vp Chest,<br>

Is a bold spirit, in a loyall brest.<br>

Mine Honor is my life; both grow in one:<br>

Take Honor from me, and my life is done.<br>

Then (deere my Liege) mine Honor let me trie,<br>

In that I liue; and for that will I die<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11087">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Coosin, throw downe your gage,<br>

Do you begin<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11088">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. Oh heauen defend my soule from such foule sin.<br>

Shall I seeme Crest-falne in my fathers sight,<br>

Or with pale beggar-feare impeach my hight<br>

Before this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my toong,<br>

Shall wound mine honor with such feeble wrong;<br>

Or sound so base a parle: my teeth shall teare<br>

The slauish motiue of recanting feare,<br>

And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,<br>

Where shame doth harbour, euen in Mowbrayes face.<br>

Lament we may, but not reuenge thee dead<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11120">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Oh let no noble eye prophane a teare<br>

For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbrayes speare:<br>

As confident, as is the Falcons flight<br>

Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.<br>

My louing Lord, I take my leaue of you,<br>

Of you (my Noble Cosin) Lord Aumerle;<br>

Not sicke, although I haue to do with death,<br>

But lustie, yong, and cheerely drawing breath.<br>

Loe, as at English Feasts, so I regreete<br>

The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.<br>

Oh thou the earthy author of my blood,<br>

Whose youthfull spirit in me regenerate,<br>

Doth with a two-fold rigor lift mee vp<br>

To reach at victory aboue my head,<br>

Adde proofe vnto mine Armour with thy prayres,<br>

And with thy blessings steele my Lances point,<br>

That it may enter Mowbrayes waxen Coate,<br>

And furnish new the name of Iohn a Gaunt,<br>

Euen in the lusty hauiour of his sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11121">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaunt. Heauen in thy good cause make thee prosp'rous<br>

Be swift like lightning in the execution,<br>

And let thy blowes doubly redoubled,<br>

Fall like amazing thunder on the Caske<br>

Of thy amaz'd pernicious enemy.<br>

Rouze vp thy youthfull blood, be valiant, and liue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11122"> Bul. Mine innocence, and S[aint]. George to thriue</p><br>

<p id="id11123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. How euer heauen or fortune cast my lot,<br>

There liues, or dies, true to Kings Richards Throne,<br>

A loyall, iust, and vpright Gentleman:<br>

Neuer did Captiue with a freer heart,<br>

Cast off his chaines of bondage, and embrace<br>

His golden vncontroul'd enfranchisement,<br>

More then my dancing soule doth celebrate<br>

This Feast of Battell, with mine Aduersarie.<br>

Most mighty Liege, and my companion Peeres,<br>

Take from my mouth, the wish of happy yeares,<br>

As gentle, and as iocond, as to iest,<br>

Go I to fight: Truth, hath a quiet brest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11124">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Farewell, my Lord, securely I espy<br>

On paine to be found false, and recreant,<br>

To proue the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray,<br>

A Traitor to his God, his King, and him,<br>

And dares him to set forwards to the fight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11129">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Har. Here standeth Tho[mas]: Mowbray Duke of Norfolk<br>

On paine to be found false and recreant,<br>

Both to defend himselfe, and to approue<br>

Couragiously, and with a free desire<br>

<p id="id11132">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Let them lay by their Helmets &amp; their Speares,<br>

And both returne backe to their Chaires againe:<br>

What with our Councell we haue done.<br>

For that our kingdomes earth should not be soyld<br>

And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect<br>

Of ciuill wounds plowgh'd vp with neighbors swords,<br>

Which so rouz'd vp with boystrous vntun'd drummes,<br>

With harsh resounding Trumpets dreadfull bray,<br>

And grating shocke of wrathfull yron Armes,<br>

And make vs wade euen in our kindreds blood:<br>

Therefore, we banish you our Territories.<br>

You Cosin Herford, vpon paine of death,<br>

Till twice fiue Summers haue enrich'd our fields,<br>

Shall not regreet our faire dominions,<br>

But treade the stranger pathes of banishment<br>

That Sun that warmes you heere, shall shine on me:<br>

And those his golden beames to you heere lent,<br>

Shall point on me, and gild my banishment<br>

<p id="id11136">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Norfolke: for thee remaines a heauier dombe,<br>

Which I with some vnwillingnesse pronounce,<br>

The slye slow houres shall not determinate<br>

The datelesse limit of thy deere exile:<br>

The hopelesse word, of Neuer to returne,<br>

Breath I against thee, vpon paine of life<br>

<p id="id11137">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. A heauy sentence, my most Soueraigne Liege,<br>

And all vnlook'd for from your Highnesse mouth:<br>

A deerer merit, not so deepe a maime,<br>

As to be cast forth in the common ayre<br>

Haue I deserued at your Highnesse hands.<br>

The Language I haue learn'd these forty yeares<br>

(My natiue English) now I must forgo,<br>

And now my tongues vse is to me no more,<br>

Then an vnstringed Vyall, or a Harpe,<br>

Or like a cunning Instrument cas'd vp,<br>

Or being open, put into his hands<br>

That knowes no touch to tune the harmony.<br>

Within my mouth you haue engaol'd my tongue,<br>

Doubly percullist with my teeth and lippes,<br>

And dull, vnfeeling, barren ignorance,<br>

Is made my Gaoler to attend on me:<br>

I am too old to fawne vpon a Nurse,<br>

Too farre in yeeres to be a pupill now:<br>

What is thy sentence then, but speechlesse death,<br>

Which robs my tongue from breathing natiue breath?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. It boots thee not to be compassionate,<br>

After our sentence, plaining comes too late<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Then thus I turne me from my countries light<br>

To dwell in solemne shades of endlesse night<br>

<p id="id11139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. Returne againe, and take an oath with thee,<br>

Lay on our Royall sword, your banisht hands;<br>

(Our part therein we banish with your selues)<br>

To keepe the Oath that we administer:<br>

You neuer shall (so helpe you Truth, and Heauen)<br>

Embrace each others loue in banishment,<br>

Nor euer looke vpon each others face,<br>

Nor euer write, regreete, or reconcile<br>

As now our flesh is banish'd from this Land.<br>

Confesse thy Treasons, ere thou flye this Realme,<br>

Since thou hast farre to go, beare not along<br>

The clogging burthen of a guilty soule<br>

My name be blotted from the booke of Life,<br>

And I from heauen banish'd, as from hence:<br>

But what thou art, heauen, thou, and I do know,<br>

And all too soone (I feare) the King shall rue.<br>

Farewell (my Liege) now no way can I stray,<br>

Saue backe to England, all the worlds my way.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11144">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Vncle, euen in the glasses of thine eyes<br>

I see thy greeued heart: thy sad aspect,<br>

Hath from the number of his banish'd yeares<br>

Pluck'd foure away: Six frozen Winters spent,<br>

Returne with welcome home, from banishment<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. How long a time lyes in one little word:<br>

Foure lagging Winters, and foure wanton springs<br>

End in a word, such is the breath of Kings<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11146">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaunt. I thanke my Liege, that in regard of me<br>

He shortens foure yeares of my sonnes exile:<br>

But little vantage shall I reape thereby.<br>

For ere the sixe yeares that he hath to spend<br>

Can change their Moones, and bring their times about,<br>

My oyle-dride Lampe, and time-bewasted light<br>

Shall be extinct with age, and endlesse night:<br>

My inch of Taper, will be burnt, and done,<br>

And blindfold death, not let me see my sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11147"> Rich. Why Vncle, thou hast many yeeres to liue</p><br>

<p id="id11148">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaunt. But not a minute (King) that thou canst giue;<br>

Shorten my dayes thou canst with sudden sorow,<br>

And plucke nights from me, but not lend a morrow:<br>

Thou canst helpe time to furrow me with age,<br>

But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage:<br>

Thy word is currant with him, for my death,<br>

But dead, thy kingdome cannot buy my breath<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11149">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. Thy sonne is banish'd vpon good aduice,<br>

Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gaue,<br>

Why at our Iustice seem'st thou then to lowre?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. Things sweet to tast, proue in digestion sowre:<br>

You vrg'd me as a Iudge, but I had rather<br>

You would haue bid me argue like a Father.<br>

Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,<br>

I was too strict to make mine owne away:<br>

But you gaue leaue to my vnwilling tong,<br>

Against my will, to do my selfe this wrong<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Cosine farewell: and Vncle bid him so:<br>

Six yeares we banish him, and he shall go.<br>

Enter.<br>

From where you do remaine, let paper show<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11153">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar. My Lord, no leaue take I, for I will ride<br>

As farre as land will let me, by your side<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11154">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaunt. Oh to what purpose dost thou hord thy words,<br>

That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. I haue too few to take my leaue of you,<br>

When the tongues office should be prodigall,<br>

To breath th' abundant dolour of the heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11155"> Gau. Thy greefe is but thy absence for a time</p><br>

<p id="id11156"> Bull. Ioy absent, greefe is present for that time</p><br>

<p id="id11157">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. What is sixe Winters, they are quickely gone?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. To men in ioy, but greefe makes one houre ten<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11158"> Gau. Call it a trauell that thou tak'st for pleasure</p><br>

<p id="id11159">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. My heart will sigh, when I miscall it so,<br>

Which findes it an inforced Pilgrimage<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. The sullen passage of thy weary steppes<br>

Esteeme a soyle, wherein thou art to set<br>

The precious Iewell of thy home returne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11161">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. Oh who can hold a fire in his hand<br>

By thinking on the frostie Caucasus?<br>

Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite,<br>

By bare imagination of a Feast?<br>

Or Wallow naked in December snow<br>

By thinking on fantasticke summers heate?<br>

Oh no, the apprehension of the good<br>

Giues but the greater feeling to the worse:<br>

Fell sorrowes tooth, doth euer ranckle more<br>

Then when it bites, but lanceth not the sore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11162">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. Come, come (my son) Ile bring thee on thy way<br>

Had I thy youth, and cause, I would not stay<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11163">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. Then Englands ground farewell: sweet soil adieu,<br>

My Mother, and my Nurse, which beares me yet:<br>

Where ere I wander, boast of this I can,<br>

Though banish'd, yet a true-borne Englishman.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11164">Scoena Quarta.</p><br>

<p id="id11165">Enter King, Aumerle, Greene, and Bagot.</p><br>

<p id="id11166">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. We did obserue. Cosine Aumerle,<br>

How far brought you high Herford on his way?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aum. I brought high Herford (if you call him so)<br>

But to the next high way, and there I left him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11167">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. And say, what store of parting tears were shed?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aum. Faith none for me: except the Northeast wind<br>

Which then grew bitterly against our face,<br>

Awak'd the sleepie rhewme, and so by chance<br>

Did grace our hollow parting with a teare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11168">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. What said our Cosin when you parted with him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Au. Farewell: and for my hart disdained y my tongue<br>

Should so prophane the word, that taught me craft<br>

To counterfeit oppression of such greefe,<br>

That word seem'd buried in my sorrowes graue.<br>

Marry, would the word Farwell, haue lengthen'd houres,<br>

And added yeeres to his short banishment,<br>

He should haue had a volume of Farwels,<br>

But since it would not, he had none of me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11169">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. He is our Cosin (Cosin) but 'tis doubt,<br>

When time shall call him home from banishment,<br>

Whether our kinsman come to see his friends,<br>

Our selfe, and Bushy: heere Bagot and Greene<br>

Obseru'd his Courtship to the common people:<br>

How he did seeme to diue into their hearts,<br>

With humble, and familiar courtesie,<br>

What reuerence he did throw away on slaues;<br>

Wooing poore Craftes-men, with the craft of soules,<br>

And patient vnder-bearing of his Fortune,<br>

As 'twere to banish their affects with him.<br>

Off goes his bonnet to an Oyster-wench,<br>

A brace of Dray-men bid God speed him well,<br>

And had the tribute of his supple knee,<br>

With thankes my Countrimen, my louing friends,<br>

As were our England in reuersion his,<br>

And he our subiects next degree in hope<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11170">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gr. Well, he is gone, &amp; with him go these thoughts:<br>

Now for the Rebels, which stand out in Ireland,<br>

Expedient manage must be made my Liege<br>

Ere further leysure, yeeld them further meanes<br>

For their aduantage, and your Highnesse losse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. We will our selfe in person to this warre,<br>

And for our Coffers, with too great a Court,<br>

And liberall Largesse, are growne somewhat light,<br>

We are inforc'd to farme our royall Realme,<br>

The Reuennew whereof shall furnish vs<br>

For our affayres in hand: if that come short<br>

Our Substitutes at home shall haue Blanke-charters:<br>

Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,<br>

They shall subscribe them for large summes of Gold,<br>

And send them after to supply our wants:<br>

For we will make for Ireland presently.<br>

Enter Bushy.<br>

<p id="id11172">Bushy, what newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bu. Old Iohn of Gaunt is verie sicke my Lord,<br>

Sodainly taken, and hath sent post haste<br>

To entreat your Maiesty to visit him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bu. At Ely house<br>

<p id="id11174">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. Now put it (heauen) in his Physitians minde,<br>

To helpe him to his graue immediately:<br>

The lining of his coffers shall make Coates<br>

To decke our souldiers for these Irish warres.<br>

Come Gentlemen, let's all go visit him:<br>

Pray heauen we may make hast, and come too late.<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id11177">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. Will the King come, that I may breath my last<br>

In wholsome counsell to his vnstaid youth?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Vex not your selfe, nor striue not with your breth,<br>

For all in vaine comes counsell to his eare<br>

<p id="id11178">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. Oh but (they say) the tongues of dying men<br>

Inforce attention like deepe harmony;<br>

Where words are scarse, they are seldome spent in vaine,<br>

For they breath truth, that breath their words in paine.<br>

He that no more must say, is listen'd more,<br>

Then they whom youth and ease haue taught to glose,<br>

More are mens ends markt, then their liues before,<br>

The setting Sun, and Musicke in the close<br>

As the last taste of sweetes, is sweetest last,<br>

Writ in remembrance, more then things long past;<br>

Though Richard my liues counsell would not heare,<br>

My deaths sad tale, may yet vndeafe his eare<br>

<p id="id11179">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. No, it is stopt with other flatt'ring sounds<br>

As praises of his state: then there are found<br>

Lasciuious Meeters, to whose venom sound<br>

The open eare of youth doth alwayes listen.<br>

Report of fashions in proud Italy,<br>

Whose manners still our tardie apish Nation<br>

Limpes after in base imitation.<br>

Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity,<br>

So it be new, there's no respect how vile,<br>

That is not quickly buz'd into his eares?<br>

That all too late comes counsell to be heard,<br>

Where will doth mutiny with wits regard:<br>

Direct not him, whose way himselfe will choose,<br>

Tis breath thou lackst, and that breath wilt thou loose<br>

And thus expiring, do foretell of him,<br>

His rash fierce blaze of Ryot cannot last,<br>

For violent fires soone burne out themselues,<br>

Small showres last long, but sodaine stormes are short,<br>

He tyres betimes, that spurs too fast betimes;<br>

With eager feeding, food doth choake the feeder:<br>

Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,<br>

Consuming meanes soone preyes vpon it selfe.<br>

This royall Throne of Kings, this sceptred Isle,<br>

This earth of Maiesty, this seate of Mars,<br>

This other Eden, demy paradise,<br>

This Fortresse built by Nature for her selfe,<br>

Against infection, and the hand of warre:<br>

This happy breed of men, this little world,<br>

This precious stone, set in the siluer sea,<br>

Which serues it in the office of a wall,<br>

Or as a Moate defensiue to a house,<br>

Against the enuy of lesse happier Lands,<br>

This blessed plot, this earth, this Realme, this England,<br>

This Nurse, this teeming wombe of Royall Kings,<br>

Fear'd by their breed, and famous for their birth,<br>

Renowned for their deeds, as farre from home,<br>

For Christian seruice, and true Chiualrie,<br>

As is the sepulcher in stubborne Iury<br>

Of the Worlds ransome, blessed Maries Sonne.<br>

This Land of such deere soules, this deere-deere Land,<br>

Deere for her reputation through the world,<br>

Is now Leas'd out (I dye pronouncing it)<br>

Like to a Tenement or pelting Farme.<br>

England bound in with the triumphant sea,<br>

Whose rocky shore beates backe the enuious siedge<br>

Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,<br>

With Inky blottes, and rotten Parchment bonds.<br>

That England, that was wont to conquer others,<br>

Hath made a shamefull conquest of it selfe.<br>

Ah! would the scandall vanish with my life,<br>

How happy then were my ensuing death?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ri. What comfort man? How ist with aged Gaunt?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ga. Oh how that name befits my composition:<br>

Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:<br>

Within me greefe hath kept a tedious fast,<br>

And who abstaynes from meate, that is not gaunt?<br>

For sleeping England long time haue I watcht,<br>

Watching breeds leannesse, leannesse is all gaunt.<br>

The pleasure that some Fathers feede vpon,<br>

Is my strict fast, I meane my Childrens lookes,<br>

And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:<br>

Gaunt am I for the graue, gaunt as a graue,<br>

Whose hollow wombe inherits naught but bones<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11183">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. Can sicke men play so nicely with their names?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. No, misery makes sport to mocke it selfe:<br>

Since thou dost seeke to kill my name in mee,<br>

I mocke my name (great King) to flatter thee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11184">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. Should dying men flatter those that liue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. No, no, men liuing flatter those that dye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11185"> Rich. Thou now a dying, sayst thou flatter'st me</p><br>

<p id="id11186"> Gau. Oh no, thou dyest, though I the sicker be</p><br>

<p id="id11187"> Rich. I am in health, I breath, I see thee ill</p><br>

Thy death-bed is no lesser then the Land,<br>

Wherein thou lyest in reputation sicke,<br>

And thou too care-lesse patient as thou art,<br>

Commit'st thy 'anointed body to the cure<br>

Of those Physitians, that first wounded thee.<br>

A thousand flatterers sit within thy Crowne,<br>

Whose compasse is no bigger then thy head,<br>

And yet incaged in so small a Verge,<br>

The waste is no whit lesser then thy Land:<br>

Oh had thy Grandsire with a Prophets eye,<br>

Seene how his sonnes sonne, should destroy his sonnes,<br>

From forth thy reach he would haue laid thy shame,<br>

Deposing thee before thou wert possest,<br>

Which art possest now to depose thy selfe.<br>

Why (Cosine) were thou Regent of the world,<br>

It were a shame to let his Land by lease:<br>

But for thy world enioying but this Land,<br>

Is it not more then shame, to shame it so?<br>

Landlord of England art thou, and not King:<br>

Thy state of Law, is bondslaue to the law,<br>

And-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. And thou, a lunaticke leane-witted foole,<br>

Presuming on an Agues priuiledge,<br>

Dar'st with thy frozen admonition<br>

Make pale our cheeke, chasing the Royall blood<br>

With fury, from his natiue residence?<br>

Now by my Seates right Royall Maiestie,<br>

Wer't thou not Brother to great Edwards sonne,<br>

This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head,<br>

Should run thy head from thy vnreuerent shoulders<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11189">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gau. Oh spare me not, my brothers Edwards sonne,<br>

For that I was his Father Edwards sonne:<br>

That blood already (like the Pellican)<br>

Thou hast tapt out, and drunkenly carows'd.<br>

My brother Gloucester, plaine well meaning soule<br>

(Whom faire befall in heauen 'mongst happy soules)<br>

May be a president, and witnesse good,<br>

That thou respect'st not spilling Edwards blood:<br>

Ioyne with the present sicknesse that I haue,<br>

And thy vnkindnesse be like crooked age,<br>

To crop at once a too-long wither'd flowre.<br>

Liue in thy shame, but dye not shame with thee,<br>

These words heereafter, thy tormentors bee.<br>

Conuey me to my bed, then to my graue,<br>

Loue they to liue, that loue and honor haue.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11190">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id11191">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. And let them dye, that age and sullens haue,<br>

For both hast thou, and both become the graue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11192">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. I do beseech your Maiestie impute his words<br>

To wayward sicklinesse, and age in him:<br>

He loues you on my life, and holds you deere<br>

As Harry Duke of Herford, were he heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11193">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Right, you say true: as Herfords loue, so his;<br>

As theirs, so mine: and all be as it is.<br>

Enter Northumberland.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11194">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. My Liege, olde Gaunt commends him to your<br>

Maiestie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11195">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. What sayes he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Nay nothing, all is said:<br>

His tongue is now a stringlesse instrument,<br>

Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11196">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Be Yorke the next, that must be bankrupt so,<br>

Though death be poore, it ends a mortall wo<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11197">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. The ripest fruit first fals, and so doth he,<br>

His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be:<br>

So much for that. Now for our Irish warres,<br>

We must supplant those rough rug-headed Kernes,<br>

Which liue like venom, where no venom else<br>

But onely they, haue priuiledge to liue.<br>

And for these great affayres do aske some charge<br>

Towards our assistance, we do seize to vs<br>

The plate, coine, reuennewes, and moueables,<br>

Whereof our Vncle Gaunt did stand possest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11198">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. How long shall I be patient? Oh how long<br>

Shall tender dutie make me suffer wrong?<br>

Not Glousters death, nor Herfords banishment,<br>

Nor Gauntes rebukes, nor Englands priuate wrongs,<br>

Nor the preuention of poore Bullingbrooke,<br>

About his marriage, nor my owne disgrace<br>

Haue euer made me sowre my patient cheeke,<br>

Or bend one wrinckle on my Soueraignes face:<br>

I am the last of noble Edwards sonnes,<br>

Of whom thy Father Prince of Wales was first,<br>

In warre was neuer Lyon rag'd more fierce:<br>

In peace, was neuer gentle Lambe more milde,<br>

Then was that yong and Princely Gentleman,<br>

His face thou hast, for euen so look'd he<br>

Accomplish'd with the number of thy howers:<br>

But when he frown'd, it was against the French,<br>

And not against his friends: his noble hand<br>

Did win what he did spend: and spent not that<br>

Which his triumphant fathers hand had won:<br>

His hands were guilty of no kindreds blood,<br>

But bloody with the enemies of his kinne:<br>

Oh Richard, Yorke is too farre gone with greefe,<br>

Or else he neuer would compare betweene<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11199">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Why Vncle,<br>

What's the matter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Oh my Liege, pardon me if you please, if not<br>

I pleas'd not to be pardon'd, am content with all:<br>

Seeke you to seize, and gripe into your hands<br>

The Royalties and Rights of banish'd Herford?<br>

Is not Gaunt dead? and doth not Herford liue?<br>

Was not Gaunt iust? and is not Harry true?<br>

Did not the one deserue to haue an heyre?<br>

Is not his heyre a well-deseruing sonne?<br>

Take Herfords rights away, and take from time<br>

His Charters, and his customarie rights:<br>

Let not to morrow then insue to day,<br>

Be not thy selfe. For how art thou a King<br>

But by faire sequence and succession?<br>

Now afore God, God forbid I say true,<br>

If you do wrongfully seize Herfords right,<br>

Call in his Letters Patents that he hath<br>

By his Atturneyes generall, to sue<br>

His Liuerie, and denie his offer'd homage,<br>

You plucke a thousand dangers on your head,<br>

You loose a thousand well-disposed hearts,<br>

And pricke my tender patience to those thoughts<br>

Which honor and allegeance cannot thinke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11200">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ric. Thinke what you will: we seise into our hands,<br>

His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11201">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Ile not be by the while: My Liege farewell,<br>

What will ensue heereof, there's none can tell.<br>

But by bad courses may be vnderstood,<br>

That their euents can neuer fall out good.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11202">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Go Bushie to the Earle of Wiltshire streight,<br>

Bid him repaire to vs to Ely house,<br>

To see this businesse: to morrow next<br>

We will for Ireland, and 'tis time, I trow:<br>

And we create in absence of our selfe<br>

Our Vncle Yorke, Lord Gouernor of England:<br>

For he is iust, and alwayes lou'd vs well.<br>

Come on our Queene, to morrow must we part,<br>

Be merry, for our time of stay is short.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11203">Flourish.</p><br>

<p id="id11204">Manet North. Willoughby, &amp; Ross.</p><br>

<p id="id11205"> Nor. Well Lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead</p><br>

<p id="id11208"> Nor. Richly in both, if iustice had her right</p><br>

<p id="id11210">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Nay speake thy mind: &amp; let him ne'r speak more<br>

That speakes thy words againe to do thee harme<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11211">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil. Tends that thou'dst speake to th' Du[ke]. of Hereford,<br>

If it be so, out with it boldly man,<br>

Quicke is mine eare to heare of good towards him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11212">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross. No good at all that I can do for him,<br>

Vnlesse you call it good to pitie him,<br>

Bereft and gelded of his patrimonie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11213">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Now afore heauen, 'tis shame such wrongs are<br>

borne.<br>

In him a royall Prince, and many moe<br>

Of noble blood in this declining Land;<br>

The King is not himselfe, but basely led<br>

By Flatterers, and what they will informe<br>

Meerely in hate 'gainst any of vs all,<br>

That will the King seuerely prosecute<br>

'Gainst vs, our liues, our children, and our heires<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11214">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. The Commons hath he pil'd with greeuous taxes<br>

And quite lost their hearts: the Nobles hath he finde<br>

For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11215">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil. And daily new exactions are deuis'd,<br>

As blankes, beneuolences, and I wot not what:<br>

But what o' Gods name doth become of this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Wars hath not wasted it, for war'd he hath not.<br>

But basely yeelded vpon comprimize,<br>

That which his Ancestors atchieu'd with blowes:<br>

More hath he spent in peace, then they in warres<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11216"> Ros. The Earle of Wiltshire hath the realme in Farme</p><br>

<p id="id11217"> Wil. The Kings growne bankrupt like a broken man</p><br>

But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke<br>

<p id="id11220">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. His noble Kinsman, most degenerate King:<br>

But Lords, we heare this fearefull tempest sing,<br>

Yet seeke no shelter to auoid the storme:<br>

We see the winde sit sore vpon our sailes,<br>

And yet we strike not, but securely perish<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11221">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. We see the very wracke that we must suffer,<br>

And vnauoyded is the danger now<br>

For suffering so the causes of our wracke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11222">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Not so: euen through the hollow eyes of death,<br>

I spie life peering: but I dare not say<br>

How neere the tidings of our comfort is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11223">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil. Nay let vs share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ros. Be confident to speake Northumberland,<br>

We three, are but thy selfe, and speaking so,<br>

Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore be bold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11224">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Then thus: I haue from Port le Blan<br>

A Bay in Britaine, receiu'd intelligence,<br>

That Harry Duke of Herford, Rainald Lord Cobham,<br>

That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,<br>

His brother Archbishop, late of Canterbury,<br>

Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir Iohn Rainston,<br>

Sir Iohn Norberie, &amp; Sir Robert Waterton, &amp; Francis Quoint,<br>

All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine,<br>

With eight tall ships, three thousand men of warre<br>

Are making hither with all due expedience,<br>

And shortly meane to touch our Northerne shore:<br>

Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay<br>

The first departing of the King for Ireland.<br>

If then we shall shake off our slauish yoake,<br>

Impe out our drooping Countries broken wing,<br>

Redeeme from broaking pawne the blemish'd Crowne,<br>

Wipe off the dust that hides our Scepters gilt,<br>

And make high Maiestie looke like it selfe,<br>

Away with me in poste to Rauenspurgh,<br>

But if you faint, as fearing to do so,<br>

Stay, and be secret, and my selfe will go<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11225"> Ros. To horse, to horse, vrge doubts to them y feare</p><br>

<p id="id11226"> Wil. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</p><br>

<p id="id11227">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id11228" style="margin-top: 2em">Scena Secunda.</p><br>

<p id="id11229">Enter Queene, Bushy, and Bagot.</p><br>

<p id="id11230">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. Madam, your Maiesty is too much sad,<br>

You promis'd when you parted with the King,<br>

To lay aside selfe-harming heauinesse,<br>

And entertaine a cheerefull disposition<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11231">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. To please the King, I did: to please my selfe<br>

I cannot do it: yet I know no cause<br>

Why I should welcome such a guest as greefe,<br>

Saue bidding farewell to so sweet a guest<br>

As my sweet Richard; yet againe me thinkes,<br>

Some vnborne sorrow, ripe in fortunes wombe<br>

Is comming towards me, and my inward soule<br>

With nothing trembles, at something it greeues,<br>

More then with parting from my Lord the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11232">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. Each substance of a greefe hath twenty shadows<br>

Which shewes like greefe it selfe, but is not so:<br>

For sorrowes eye, glazed with blinding teares,<br>

Diuides one thing intire, to many obiects,<br>

Like perspectiues, which rightly gaz'd vpon<br>

Shew nothing but confusion, ey'd awry,<br>

Distinguish forme: so your sweet Maiestie<br>

Looking awry vpon your Lords departure,<br>

Finde shapes of greefe, more then himselfe to waile,<br>

Which look'd on as it is, is naught but shadowes<br>

Of what it is not: then thrice-gracious Queene,<br>

More then your Lords departure weep not, more's not seene;<br>

Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrowes eie,<br>

Which for things true, weepe things imaginary<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11233">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. It may be so: but yet my inward soule<br>

Perswades me it is otherwise: how ere it be,<br>

I cannot but be sad: so heauy sad,<br>

As though on thinking on no thought I thinke,<br>

Makes me with heauy nothing faint and shrinke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. 'Tis nothing but conceit (my gracious Lady.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. 'Tis nothing lesse: conceit is still deriu'd<br>

From some fore-father greefe, mine is not so,<br>

For nothing hath begot my something greefe,<br>

Or something, hath the nothing that I greeue,<br>

'Tis in reuersion that I do possesse,<br>

But what it is, that is not yet knowne, what<br>

I cannot name, 'tis namelesse woe I wot.<br>

Enter Greene.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11235">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gree. Heauen saue your Maiesty, and wel met Gentlemen:<br>

I hope the King is not yet shipt for Ireland<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11236">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Why hop'st thou so? Tis better hope he is:<br>

For his designes craue hast, his hast good hope,<br>

Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipt?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. That he our hope, might haue retyr'd his power,<br>

and driuen into dispaire an enemies hope,<br>

Who strongly hath set footing in this Land.<br>

The banish'd Bullingbrooke repeales himselfe,<br>

And with vp-lifted Armes is safe arriu'd<br>

At Rauenspurg<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11237"> Qu. Now God in heauen forbid</p><br>

<p id="id11238">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gr. O Madam 'tis too true: and that is worse,<br>

The L[ord]. Northumberland, his yong sonne Henrie Percie,<br>

The Lords of Rosse, Beaumond, and Willoughby,<br>

With all their powrefull friends are fled to him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. Why haue you not proclaim'd Northumberland<br>

And the rest of the reuolted faction, Traitors?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gre. We haue: whereupon the Earle of Worcester<br>

Hath broke his staffe, resign'd his Stewardship,<br>

And al the houshold seruants fled with him to Bullinbrook<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. So Greene, thou art the midwife of my woe,<br>

And Bullinbrooke my sorrowes dismall heyre:<br>

Now hath my soule brought forth her prodegie,<br>

And I a gasping new deliuered mother,<br>

Haue woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow ioyn'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11240"> Bush. Dispaire not Madam</p><br>

<p id="id11241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Who shall hinder me?<br>

I will dispaire, and be at enmitie<br>

With couzening hope; he is a Flatterer,<br>

A Parasite, a keeper backe of death,<br>

Who gently would dissolue the bands of life,<br>

Which false hopes linger in extremity.<br>

Enter Yorke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11242"> Gre. Heere comes the Duke of Yorke</p><br>

<p id="id11243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. With signes of warre about his aged necke,<br>

Oh full of carefull businesse are his lookes:<br>

Vncle, for heauens sake speake comfortable words:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Comfort's in heauen, and we are on the earth,<br>

Where nothing liues but crosses, care and greefe:<br>

Your husband he is gone to saue farre off,<br>

Whilst others come to make him loose at home:<br>

Heere am I left to vnder-prop his Land,<br>

Who weake with age, cannot support my selfe:<br>

Now comes the sicke houre that his surfet made,<br>

Now shall he try his friends that flattered him.<br>

Enter a seruant.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11244"> Ser. My Lord, your sonne was gone before I came</p><br>

<p id="id11245">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. He was: why so: go all which way it will:<br>

The Nobles they are fled, the Commons they are cold,<br>

And will I feare reuolt on Herfords side.<br>

Sirra, get thee to Plashie to my sister Gloster,<br>

Bid her send me presently a thousand pound,<br>

Hold, take my Ring<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11246">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. My Lord, I had forgot<br>

To tell your Lordship, to day I came by, and call'd there,<br>

But I shall greeue you to report the rest<br>

<p id="id11247">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. What is't knaue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. An houre before I came, the Dutchesse di'de<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11248">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Heau'n for his mercy, what a tide of woes<br>

Come rushing on this wofull Land at once?<br>

I know not what to do: I would to heauen<br>

(So my vntruth had not prouok'd him to it)<br>

The King had cut off my head with my brothers.<br>

What, are there postes dispatcht for Ireland?<br>

How shall we do for money for these warres?<br>

Come sister (Cozen I would say) pray pardon me.<br>

Go fellow, get thee home, prouide some Carts,<br>

And bring away the Armour that is there.<br>

Gentlemen, will you muster men?<br>

If I know how, or which way to order these affaires<br>

Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,<br>

Neuer beleeue me. Both are my kinsmen,<br>

Th' one is my Soueraigne, whom both my oath<br>

And dutie bids defend: th' other againe<br>

Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd,<br>

Whom conscience, and my kindred bids to right:<br>

Well, somewhat we must do: Come Cozen,<br>

Ile dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster vp your men,<br>

And meet me presently at Barkley Castle:<br>

I should to Plashy too: but time will not permit,<br>

All is vneuen, and euery thing is left at six and seuen.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11249">Exit</p><br>

<p id="id11250">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. The winde sits faire for newes to go to Ireland,<br>

But none returnes: For vs to leuy power<br>

Proportionable to th' enemy, is all impossible<br>

<p id="id11251">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gr. Besides our neerenesse to the King in loue,<br>

Is neere the hate of those loue not the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11252">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ba. And that's the wauering Commons, for their loue<br>

Lies in their purses, and who so empties them,<br>

By so much fils their hearts with deadly hate<br>

The Earle of Wiltshire is alreadie there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11255">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. Thither will I with you, for little office<br>

Will the hatefull Commons performe for vs,<br>

Except like Curres, to teare vs all in peeces:<br>

Will you go along with vs?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bag. No, I will to Ireland to his Maiestie:<br>

Farewell, if hearts presages be not vaine,<br>

We three here part, that neu'r shall meete againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11256">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bu. That's as Yorke thriues to beate back Bullinbroke<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gr. Alas poore Duke, the taske he vndertakes<br>

Is numbring sands, and drinking Oceans drie,<br>

Where one on his side fights, thousands will flye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11257">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush. Farewell at once, for once, for all, and euer.<br>

Well, we may meete againe<br>

I am a stranger heere in Gloustershire,<br>

These high wilde hilles, and rough vneeuen waies,<br>

Drawes out our miles, and makes them wearisome.<br>

And yet our faire discourse hath beene as sugar,<br>

Making the hard way sweet and delectable:<br>

But I bethinke me, what a wearie way<br>

From Rauenspurgh to Cottshold will be found,<br>

In Rosse and Willoughby, wanting your companie,<br>

Which I protest hath very much beguild<br>

The tediousnesse, and processe of my trauell:<br>

The present benefit that I possesse;<br>

And hope to ioy, is little lesse in ioy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Percie. I had thought, my Lord, to haue learn'd his<br>

health of you<br>

<p id="id11265">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. Why, is he not with the Queene?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Percie. No, my good Lord, he hath forsook the Court,<br>

Broken his Staffe of Office, and disperst<br>

The Household of the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11266">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. What was his reason?<br>

He was not so resolu'd, when we last spake together<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11267">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percie. Because your Lordship was proclaimed Traitor.<br>

But hee, my Lord, is gone to Rauenspurgh,<br>

To offer seruice to the Duke of Hereford,<br>

And sent me ouer by Barkely, to discouer<br>

What power the Duke of Yorke had leuied there,<br>

Stands for my Bountie: but who comes here?<br>

Enter Barkely.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11278"> North. It is my Lord of Barkely, as I ghesse</p><br>

<p id="id11279"> Bark. My Lord of Hereford, my Message is to you</p><br>

And I must finde that Title in your Tongue,<br>

Before I make reply to aught you say<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11281">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bark. Mistake me not, my Lord, 'tis not my meaning<br>

To raze one Title of your Honor out.<br>

To you, my Lord, I come (what Lord you will)<br>

From the most glorious of this Land,<br>

The Duke of Yorke, to know what pricks you on<br>

To take aduantage of the absent time,<br>

And fright our Natiue Peace with selfe-borne Armes.<br>

Enter Yorke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11282">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. I shall not need transport my words by you,<br>

Here comes his Grace in Person. My Noble Vnckle<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11283">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York. Shew me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,<br>

Whose dutie is deceiuable, and false<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11284"> Bull. My gracious Vnckle</p><br>

<p id="id11285">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York. Tut, tut, Grace me no Grace, nor Vnckle me,<br>

I am no Traytors Vnckle; and that word Grace,<br>

In an vngracious mouth, is but prophane.<br>

Why haue these banish'd, and forbidden Legges,<br>

Dar'd once to touch a Dust of Englands Ground?<br>

But more then why, why haue they dar'd to march<br>

So many miles vpon her peacefull Bosome,<br>

Frighting her pale-fac'd Villages with Warre,<br>

And ostentation of despised Armes?<br>

Com'st thou because th' anoynted King is hence?<br>

Why foolish Boy, the King is left behind,<br>

And in my loyall Bosome lyes his power.<br>

Were I but now the Lord of such hot youth,<br>

As when braue Gaunt, thy Father, and my selfe<br>

Rescued the Black Prince, that yong Mars of men,<br>

From forth the Rankes of many thousand French:<br>

Oh then, how quickly should this Arme of mine,<br>

Now Prisoner to the Palsie, chastise thee,<br>

And minister correction to thy Fault<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11286">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. My gracious Vnckle, let me know my Fault,<br>

On what Condition stands it, and wherein?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;York. Euen in Condition of the worst degree,<br>

In grosse Rebellion, and detested Treason:<br>

Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come<br>

Before th' expiration of thy time,<br>

In brauing Armes against thy Soueraigne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11287">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford,<br>

But as I come, I come for Lancaster.<br>

And Noble Vnckle, I beseech your Grace<br>

Looke on my Wrongs with an indifferent eye:<br>

You are my Father, for me thinkes in you<br>

I see old Gaunt aliue. Oh then my Father,<br>

Will you permit, that I shall stand condemn'd<br>

A wandring Vagabond; my Rights and Royalties<br>

Pluckt from my armes perforce, and giuen away<br>

To vpstart Vnthrifts? Wherefore was I borne?<br>

If that my Cousin King, be King of England,<br>

It must be graunted, I am Duke of Lancaster.<br>

You haue a Sonne, Aumerle, my Noble Kinsman,<br>

Had you first died, and he beene thus trod downe,<br>

He should haue found his Vnckle Gaunt a Father,<br>

To rowze his Wrongs, and chase them to the bay.<br>

I am denyde to sue my Liuerie here,<br>

And yet my Letters Patents giue me leaue:<br>

My Fathers goods are all distraynd, and sold,<br>

And these, and all, are all amisse imployd.<br>

What would you haue me doe? I am a Subiect,<br>

And challenge Law: Attorneyes are deny'd me;<br>

And therefore personally I lay my claime<br>

To my Inheritance of free Discent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11288"> North. The Noble Duke hath been too much abus'd</p><br>

<p id="id11289"> Ross. It stands your Grace vpon, to doe him right</p><br>

<p id="id11290"> Willo. Base men by his endowments are made great</p><br>

And labour'd all I could to doe him right:<br>

Wee all haue strongly sworne to giue him ayd,<br>

And let him neu'r see Ioy, that breakes that Oath<br>

<p id="id11293">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York. Well, well, I see the issue of these Armes,<br>

I cannot mend it, I must needes confesse,<br>

Because my power is weake, and all ill left:<br>

But if I could, by him that gaue me life,<br>

I would attach you all, and make you stoope<br>

Vnto the Soueraigne Mercy of the King.<br>

But since I cannot, be it knowne to you,<br>

I doe remaine as Neuter. So fare you well,<br>

Vnlesse you please to enter in the Castle,<br>

And there repose you for this Night<br>

But wee must winne your Grace to goe with vs<br>

To Bristow Castle, which they say is held<br>

By Bushie, Bagot, and their Complices,<br>

The Caterpillers of the Commonwealth,<br>

Which I haue sworne to weed, and plucke away<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11295">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York. It may be I will go with you: but yet Ile pawse,<br>

In Murthers and in Out-rage bloody here:<br>

But when from vnder this Terrestriall Ball<br>

And darts his Lightning through eu'ry guiltie hole,<br>

Then Murthers, Treasons, and detested sinnes<br>

(The Cloake of Night being pluckt from off their backs)<br>

Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselues.<br>

So when this Theefe, this Traytor Bullingbrooke,<br>

The worst is worldly losse, thou canst vnfold:<br>

Say, Is my Kingdome lost? why 'twas my Care:<br>

And what losse is it to be rid of Care?<br>

Striues Bullingbrooke to be as Great as wee?<br>

Greater he shall not be: If hee serue God,<br>

Wee'l serue him too, and be his Fellow so.<br>

Reuolt our Subiects? That we cannot mend,<br>

Cry Woe, Destruction, Ruine, Losse, Decay,<br>

Which make the Siluer Riuers drowne their Shores,<br>

As if the World were all dissolu'd to teares:<br>

So high, aboue his Limits, swells the Rage<br>

Of Bullingbrooke, couering your fearefull Land<br>

With hard bright Steele, and hearts harder then Steele:<br>

White Beares haue arm'd their thin and hairelesse Scalps<br>

Against thy Maiestie, and Boyes with Womens Voyces,<br>

Striue to speake bigge, and clap their female ioints<br>

In stiffe vnwieldie Armes: against thy Crowne<br>

Thy very Beads-men learne to bend their Bowes<br>

Of double fatall Eugh: against thy State<br>

Yea Distaffe-Women manage rustie Bills:<br>

Against thy Seat both young and old rebell,<br>

And all goes worse then I haue power to tell<br>

<p id="id11325">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Too well, too well thou tell'st a Tale so ill.<br>

Where is the Earle of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?<br>

What is become of Bushie? where is Greene?<br>

That they haue let the dangerous Enemie<br>

Measure our Confines with such peacefull steps?<br>

If we preuaile, their heads shall pay for it.<br>

I warrant they haue made peace with Bullingbrooke<br>

<p id="id11326">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroope. Peace haue they made with him indeede (my<br>

Dogges, easily woon to fawne on any man,<br>

Snakes in my heart blood warm'd, that sting my heart,<br>

Three Iudasses, each one thrice worse then Iudas,<br>

Would they make peace? terrible Hell make warre<br>

Vpon their spotted Soules for this Offence<br>

<p id="id11327">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroope. Sweet Loue (I see) changing his propertie,<br>

Turnes to the sowrest, and most deadly hate:<br>

Againe vncurse their Soules; their peace is made<br>

With Heads, and not with Hands: those whom you curse<br>

Haue felt the worst of Deaths destroying hand,<br>

And lye full low, grau'd in the hollow ground<br>

Let's talke of Graues, of Wormes, and Epitaphs,<br>

Make Dust our Paper, and with Raynie eyes<br>

Write Sorrow on the Bosome of the Earth.<br>

Let's chuse Executors, and talke of Wills:<br>

And yet not so; for what can we bequeath,<br>

Saue our deposed bodies to the ground?<br>

Our Lands, our Liues, and all are Bullingbrookes,<br>

And nothing can we call our owne, but Death,<br>

And that small Modell of the barren Earth,<br>

Which serues as Paste, and Couer to our Bones:<br>

For Heauens sake let vs sit vpon the ground,<br>

And tell sad stories of the death of Kings:<br>

How some haue been depos'd, some slaine in warre,<br>

Some haunted by the Ghosts they haue depos'd,<br>

Some poyson'd by their Wiues, some sleeping kill'd,<br>

All murther'd. For within the hollow Crowne<br>

That rounds the mortall Temples of a King,<br>

Keepes Death his Court, and there the Antique sits<br>

Scoffing his State, and grinning at his Pompe,<br>

Allowing him a breath, a little Scene,<br>

To Monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with lookes,<br>

Infusing him with selfe and vaine conceit,<br>

As if this Flesh, which walls about our Life,<br>

Were Brasse impregnable: and humor'd thus,<br>

Comes at the last, and with a little Pinne<br>

Bores through his Castle Walls, and farwell King.<br>

Couer your heads, and mock not flesh and blood<br>

With solemne Reuerence: throw away Respect,<br>

Tradition, Forme, and Ceremonious dutie,<br>

For you haue but mistooke me all this while:<br>

I liue with Bread like you, feele Want,<br>

Taste Griefe, need Friends: subiected thus,<br>

How can you say to me, I am a King?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl. My Lord, wise men ne're waile their present woes,<br>

But presently preuent the wayes to waile:<br>

To feare the Foe, since feare oppresseth strength,<br>

Giues in your weakenesse, strength vnto your Foe;<br>

Feare, and be slaine, no worse can come to sight,<br>

And fight and die, is death destroying death,<br>

Where fearing, dying, payes death seruile breath<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11330">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aum. My Father hath a Power, enquire of him;<br>

And learne to make a Body of a Limbe<br>

<p id="id11331">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Thou chid'st me well: proud Bullingbrooke I come<br>

To change Blowes with thee, for our day of Doome:<br>

This ague fit of feare is ouer-blowne,<br>

An easie taske it is to winne our owne.<br>

Say Scroope, where lyes our Vnckle with his Power?<br>

Speake sweetly man, although thy lookes be sowre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11332">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroope. Men iudge by the complexion of the Skie<br>

The state and inclination of the day;<br>

So may you by my dull and heauie Eye:<br>

My Tongue hath but a heauier Tale to say:<br>

I play the Torturer, by small and small<br>

To lengthen out the worst, that must be spoken.<br>

Your Vnckle Yorke is ioyn'd with Bullingbrooke,<br>

And all your Northerne Castles yeelded vp,<br>

And all your Southerne Gentlemen in Armes<br>

Vpon his Faction<br>

<p id="id11333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Thou hast said enough.<br>

Beshrew thee Cousin, which didst lead me forth<br>

Of that sweet way I was in, to despaire:<br>

What say you now? What comfort haue we now?<br>

By Heauen Ile hate him euerlastingly,<br>

That bids me be of comfort any more.<br>

Goe to Flint Castle, there Ile pine away,<br>

A King, Woes slaue, shall Kingly Woe obey:<br>

That Power I haue, discharge, and let 'em goe<br>

To eare the Land, that hath some hope to grow,<br>

For I haue none. Let no man speake againe<br>

To alter this, for counsaile is but vaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11334"> Aum. My Liege, one word</p><br>

<p id="id11335">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. He does me double wrong,<br>

Least you mistake the Heauens are ore your head<br>

<p id="id11346">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. I know it (Vnckle) and oppose not my selfe<br>

Against their will. But who comes here?<br>

Enter Percie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11347">Welcome Harry: what, will not this Castle yeeld?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Per. The Castle royally is mann'd, my Lord,<br>

Against thy entrance<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11348">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Royally? Why, it containes no King?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Per. Yes (my good Lord)<br>

It doth containe a King: King Richard lyes<br>

Within the limits of yond Lime and Stone,<br>

And with him, the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,<br>

Sir Stephen Scroope, besides a Clergie man<br>

Of holy reuerence; who, I cannot learne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11349"> North. Oh, belike it is the Bishop of Carlile</p><br>

<p id="id11350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Noble Lord,<br>

Goe to the rude Ribs of that ancient Castle,<br>

Through Brazen Trumpet send the breath of Parle<br>

Into his ruin'd Eares, and thus deliuer:<br>

Henry Bullingbrooke vpon his knees doth kisse<br>

King Richards hand, and sends allegeance<br>

And true faith of heart to his Royall Person: hither come<br>

Euen at his feet, to lay my Armes and Power,<br>

Prouided, that my Banishment repeal'd,<br>

And Lands restor'd againe, be freely graunted:<br>

If not, Ile vse th 'aduantage of my Power,<br>

And lay the Summers dust with showers of blood,<br>

Rayn'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen;<br>

The which, how farre off from the mind of Bullingbrooke<br>

It is, such Crimson Tempest should bedrench<br>

The fresh greene Lap of faire King Richards Land,<br>

My stooping dutie tenderly shall shew.<br>

Goe signifie as much, while here we march<br>

Vpon the Grassie Carpet of this Plaine:<br>

Let's march without the noyse of threatning Drum,<br>

That from this Castles tatter'd Battlements<br>

Our faire Appointments may be well perus'd.<br>

Me thinkes King Richard and my selfe should meet<br>

With no lesse terror then the Elements<br>

Of Fire and Water, when their thundring smoake<br>

At meeting teares the cloudie Cheekes of Heauen:<br>

Be he the fire, Ile be the yeelding Water;<br>

The Rage be his, while on the Earth I raine<br>

My Waters on the Earth, and not on him.<br>

March on, and marke King Richard how he lookes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11351">Parle without, and answere within: then a Flourish. Enter on the<br>

Walls,<br>

Richard, Carlile, Aumerle, Scroop, Salisbury.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11352">See, see, King Richard doth himselfe appeare<br>

As doth the blushing discontented Sunne,<br>

From out the fierie Portall of the East,<br>

When he perceiues the enuious Clouds are bent<br>

To dimme his glory, and to staine the tract<br>

Of his bright passage to the Occident<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11353">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York. Yet lookes he like a King: behold his Eye<br>

(As bright as is the Eagles) lightens forth<br>

Controlling Maiestie: alack, alack, for woe,<br>

That any harme should staine so faire a shew<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11354">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Wee are amaz'd, and thus long haue we stood<br>

To watch the fearefull bending of thy knee,<br>

Because we thought our selfe thy lawfull King:<br>

And if we be, how dare thy ioynts forget<br>

To pay their awfull dutie to our presence?<br>

If we be not, shew vs the Hand of God,<br>

That hath dismiss'd vs from our Stewardship,<br>

For well wee know, no Hand of Blood and Bone<br>

Can gripe the sacred Handle of our Scepter,<br>

Vnlesse he doe prophane, steale, or vsurpe.<br>

And though you thinke, that all, as you haue done,<br>

Haue torne their Soules, by turning them from vs,<br>

And we are barren, and bereft of Friends:<br>

Yet know, my Master, God Omnipotent,<br>

Is mustring in his Clouds, on our behalfe,<br>

Armies of Pestilence, and they shall strike<br>

Your Children yet vnborne, and vnbegot,<br>

That lift your Vassall Hands against my Head,<br>

And threat the Glory of my precious Crowne.<br>

Tell Bullingbrooke, for yond me thinkes he is,<br>

That euery stride he makes vpon my Land,<br>

Is dangerous Treason: He is come to ope<br>

The purple Testament of bleeding Warre;<br>

But ere the Crowne he lookes for, liue in peace,<br>

Ten thousand bloody crownes of Mothers Sonnes<br>

Shall ill become the flower of Englands face,<br>

Change the complexion of her Maid-pale Peace<br>

To Scarlet Indignation, and bedew<br>

Her Pastors Grasse with faithfull English Blood<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11355">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. The King of Heauen forbid our Lord the King<br>

Should so with ciuill and vnciuill Armes<br>

Be rush'd vpon: Thy thrice-noble Cousin,<br>

Harry Bullingbrooke, doth humbly kisse thy hand,<br>

And by the Honorable Tombe he sweares,<br>

That stands vpon your Royall Grandsires Bones,<br>

And by the Royalties of both your Bloods,<br>

(Currents that spring from one most gracious Head)<br>

And by the buried Hand of Warlike Gaunt,<br>

And by the Worth and Honor of himselfe,<br>

Comprising all that may be sworne, or said,<br>

His comming hither hath no further scope,<br>

Then for his Lineall Royalties, and to begge<br>

Infranchisement immediate on his knees:<br>

Which on thy Royall partie graunted once,<br>

His glittering Armes he will commend to Rust,<br>

His barbed Steedes to Stables, and his heart<br>

To faithfull seruice of your Maiestie:<br>

This sweares he, as he is a Prince, is iust,<br>

And as I am a Gentleman, I credit him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11356">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Northumberland, say thus: The King returnes,<br>

His Noble Cousin is right welcome hither,<br>

And all the number of his faire demands<br>

Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:<br>

With all the gracious vtterance thou hast,<br>

Speake to his gentle hearing kind commends.<br>

We doe debase our selfe (Cousin) doe we not,<br>

To looke so poorely, and to speake so faire?<br>

Shall we call back Northumberland, and send<br>

Defiance to the Traytor, and so die?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aum. No, good my Lord, let's fight with gentle words,<br>

Till time lend friends, and friends their helpeful Swords<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Oh God, oh God, that ere this tongue of mine,<br>

That layd the Sentence of dread Banishment<br>

On yond prowd man, should take it off againe<br>

With words of sooth: Oh that I were as great<br>

As is my Griefe, or lesser then my Name,<br>

Or that I could forget what I haue beene,<br>

Or not remember what I must be now:<br>

Swell'st thou prowd heart? Ile giue thee scope to beat,<br>

Since Foes haue scope to beat both thee and me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11358"> Aum. Northumberland comes backe from Bullingbrooke</p><br>

<p id="id11359">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. What must the King doe now? must he submit?<br>

The King shall doe it: Must he be depos'd?<br>

The King shall be contented: Must he loose<br>

The Name of King? o' Gods Name let it goe.<br>

Ile giue my Iewels for a sett of Beades,<br>

My gorgeous Pallace, for a Hermitage,<br>

My gay Apparrell, for an Almes-mans Gowne,<br>

My figur'd Goblets, for a Dish of Wood,<br>

My Scepter, for a Palmers walking Staffe,<br>

My Subiects, for a payre of carued Saints,<br>

And my large Kingdome, for a little Graue,<br>

A little little Graue, an obscure Graue.<br>

Or Ile be buryed in the Kings high-way,<br>

Some way of common Trade, where Subiects feet<br>

May howrely trample on their Soueraignes Head:<br>

For on my heart they tread now, whilest I liue;<br>

And buryed once, why not vpon my Head?<br>

Aumerle, thou weep'st (my tender-hearted Cousin)<br>

Wee'le make foule Weather with despised Teares:<br>

Our sighes, and they, shall lodge the Summer Corne,<br>

And make a Dearth in this reuolting Land.<br>

Or shall we play the Wantons with our Woes,<br>

And make some prettie Match, with shedding Teares?<br>

As thus: to drop them still vpon one place,<br>

Till they haue fretted vs a payre of Graues,<br>

Within the Earth: and therein lay'd, there lyes<br>

Two Kinsmen, digg'd their Graues with weeping Eyes?<br>

Would not this ill, doe well? Well, well, I see<br>

I talke but idly, and you mock at mee.<br>

Most mightie Prince, my Lord Northumberland,<br>

What sayes King Bullingbrooke? Will his Maiestie<br>

Giue Richard leaue to liue, till Richard die?<br>

You make a Legge, and Bullingbrooke sayes I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. My Lord, in the base Court he doth attend<br>

To speake with you, may it please you to come downe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11361">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Downe, downe I come, like glist'ring Phaeton,<br>

Wanting the manage of vnruly Iades.<br>

In the base Court? base Court, where Kings grow base,<br>

To come at Traytors Calls, and doe them Grace.<br>

In the base Court come down: down Court, down King,<br>

For night-Owls shrike, where mou[n]ting Larks should sing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. What sayes his Maiestie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;North. Sorrow, and griefe of heart<br>

Makes him speake fondly, like a frantick man:<br>

Yet he is come<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11363">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Stand all apart,<br>

And shew faire dutie to his Maiestie.<br>

My gracious Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11364">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Faire Cousin,<br>

You debase your Princely Knee,<br>

To make the base Earth prowd with kissing it.<br>

Me rather had, my Heart might feele your Loue,<br>

Then my vnpleas'd Eye see your Courtesie.<br>

Vp Cousin, vp, your Heart is vp, I know,<br>

Thus high at least, although your Knee be low<br>

They well deserue to haue,<br>

That know the strong'st, and surest way to get.<br>

Vnckle giue me your Hand: nay, drie your Eyes,<br>

Teares shew their Loue, but want their Remedies.<br>

Cousin, I am too young to be your Father,<br>

Though you are old enough to be my Heire.<br>

What you will haue, Ile giue, and willing to,<br>

For doe we must, what force will haue vs doe.<br>

Set on towards London:<br>

Goe thou, and like an Executioner<br>

Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprayes,<br>

That looke too loftie in our Common-wealth:<br>

The noysome Weedes, that without profit sucke<br>

The Soyles fertilitie from wholesome flowers<br>

Is full of Weedes, her fairest Flowers choakt vp,<br>

That seem'd, in eating him, to hold him vp,<br>

Are pull'd vp, Root and all, by Bullingbrooke:<br>

<p id="id11389">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. What are they dead?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gard. They are,<br>

And Bullingbrooke hath seiz'd the wastefull King.<br>

Oh, what pitty is it, that he had not so trim'd<br>

And drest his Land, as we this Garden, at time of yeare,<br>

And wound the Barke, the skin of our Fruit-trees,<br>

Least being ouer-proud with Sap and Blood,<br>

With too much riches it confound it selfe?<br>

Had he done so, to great and growing men,<br>

They might haue liu'd to beare, and he to taste<br>

Their fruites of dutie. Superfluous branches<br>

We lop away, that bearing boughes may liue:<br>

Had he done so, himselfe had borne the Crowne,<br>

Which waste and idle houres, hath quite thrown downe<br>
</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gar. Deprest he is already, and depos'd<br>

'Tis doubted he will be. Letters came last night<br>

To a deere Friend of the Duke of Yorkes,<br>

That tell blacke tydings<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11391">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Oh I am prest to death through want of speaking:<br>

Thou old Adams likenesse, set to dresse this Garden:<br>

How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this vnpleasing newes<br>

What Eue? what Serpent hath suggested thee,<br>

To make a second fall of cursed man?<br>

Why do'st thou say, King Richard is depos'd,<br>

Dar'st thou, thou little better thing then earth,<br>

Cam'st thou by this ill-tydings? Speake thou wretch<br>

To breath these newes; yet what I say, is true;<br>

King Richard, he is in the mighty hold<br>

Of Bullingbrooke, their Fortunes both are weigh'd:<br>

In your Lords Scale, is nothing but himselfe,<br>

And some few Vanities, that make him light:<br>

But in the Ballance of great Bullingbrooke,<br>

Besides himselfe, are all the English Peeres,<br>

And with that oddes he weighes King Richard downe.<br>

Poste you to London, and you'l finde it so,<br>

I speake no more, then euery one doth know<br>

<p id="id11393">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Nimble mischance, that art so light of foote,<br>

Doth not thy Embassage belong to me?<br>

And am I last that knowes it? Oh thou think'st<br>

To serue me last, that I may longest keepe<br>

Thy sorrow in my breast. Come Ladies goe,<br>

To meet at London, Londons King in woe.<br>

What was I borne to this: that my sad looke,<br>

Should grace the Triumph of great Bullingbrooke.<br>

Against Aumerle we will enforce his Tryall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11418">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl. That honorable day shall ne're be seene.<br>

Many a time hath banish'd Norfolke fought<br>

For Iesu Christ, in glorious Christian field<br>

Streaming the Ensigne of the Christian Crosse,<br>

Against black Pagans, Turkes, and Saracens:<br>

And toyl'd with workes of Warre, retyr'd himselfe<br>

To Italy, and there at Venice gaue<br>

His Body to that pleasant Countries Earth,<br>

And his pure Soule vnto his Captaine Christ,<br>

Vnder whose Colours he had fought so long<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11419">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Why Bishop, is Norfolke dead?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl. As sure as I liue, my Lord<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11420">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Sweet peace conduct his sweet Soule<br>

To the Bosome of good old Abraham.<br>

Lords Appealants, your differe[n]ces shal all rest vnder gage,<br>

Till we assigne you to your dayes of Tryall.<br>

Enter Yorke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11421">&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee<br>

From plume-pluckt Richard, who with willing Soule<br>

Adopts thee Heire, and his high Scepter yeelds<br>

To the possession of thy Royall Hand.<br>

Ascend his Throne, descending now from him,<br>

And long liue Henry, of that Name the Fourth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11422"> Bull. In Gods Name, Ile ascend the Regall Throne</p><br>

<p id="id11423">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl. Mary, Heauen forbid.<br>

Worst in this Royall Presence may I speake,<br>

Yet best beseeming me to speake the truth.<br>

Would God, that any in this Noble Presence<br>

Were enough Noble, to be vpright Iudge<br>

Of Noble Richard: then true Noblenesse would<br>

Learne him forbearance from so foule a Wrong.<br>

What Subiect can giue Sentence on his King?<br>

And who sits here, that is not Richards Subiect?<br>

Theeues are not iudg'd, but they are by to heare,<br>

Although apparant guilt be seene in them:<br>

And shall the figure of Gods Maiestie,<br>

His Captaine, Steward, Deputie elect,<br>

Anoynted, Crown'd, planted many yeeres,<br>

Be iudg'd by subiect, and inferior breathe,<br>

And he himselfe not present? Oh, forbid it, God,<br>

That in a Christian Climate, Soules refin'de<br>

Should shew so heynous, black, obscene a deed.<br>

I speake to Subiects, and a Subiect speakes,<br>

Stirr'd vp by Heauen, thus boldly for his King<br>

My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call King,<br>

Is a foule Traytor to prowd Herefords King.<br>

And if you Crowne him, let me prophecie,<br>

The blood of English shall manure the ground,<br>

And future Ages groane for his foule Act.<br>

Peace shall goe sleepe with Turkes and Infidels,<br>

And in this Seat of Peace, tumultuous Warres<br>

Shall Kinne with Kinne, and Kinde with Kinde confound.<br>

Disorder, Horror, Feare, and Mutinie<br>

Shall here inhabite, and this Land be call'd<br>

The field of Golgotha, and dead mens Sculls.<br>

Oh, if you reare this House, against this House<br>

It will the wofullest Diuision proue,<br>

That euer fell vpon this cursed Earth.<br>

Preuent it, resist it, and let it not be so,<br>

Least Child, Childs Children cry against you, Woe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11424">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. Well haue you argu'd Sir: and for your paines,<br>

Of Capitall Treason we arrest you here.<br>

My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge,<br>

To keepe him safely, till his day of Tryall.<br>

May it please you, Lords, to grant the Commons Suit?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Fetch hither Richard, that in common view<br>

He may surrender: so we shall proceede<br>

Without suspition<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11425">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. I will be his Conduct.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11426">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Lords, you that here are vnder our Arrest,<br>

Procure your Sureties for your Dayes of Answer:<br>

Little are we beholding to your Loue,<br>

And little look'd for at your helping Hands.<br>

Enter Richard and Yorke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11427">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Alack, why am I sent for to a King,<br>

Before I haue shooke off the Regall thoughts<br>

Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet haue learn'd<br>

To insinuate, flatter, bowe, and bend my Knee.<br>

Giue Sorrow leaue a while, to tuture me<br>

To this submission. Yet I well remember<br>

The fauors of these men: were they not mine?<br>

Did they not sometime cry, All hayle to me?<br>

So Iudas did to Christ: but he in twelue,<br>

Found truth in all, but one; I, in twelue thousand, none.<br>

God saue the King: will no man say, Amen?<br>

Am I both Priest, and Clarke? well then, Amen.<br>

God saue the King, although I be not hee:<br>

And yet Amen, if Heauen doe thinke him mee.<br>

To doe what seruice, am I sent for hither?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. To doe that office of thine owne good will,<br>

Which tyred Maiestie did make thee offer:<br>

The Resignation of thy State and Crowne<br>

To Henry Bullingbrooke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11428">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Giue me the Crown. Here Cousin, seize y Crown:<br>

Here Cousin, on this side my Hand, on that side thine.<br>

Now is this Golden Crowne like a deepe Well,<br>

That owes two Buckets, filling one another,<br>

The emptier euer dancing in the ayre,<br>

The other downe, vnseene, and full of Water:<br>

That Bucket downe, and full of Teares am I,<br>

Drinking my Griefes, whil'st you mount vp on high<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11429"> Bull. I thought you had been willing to resigne</p><br>

<p id="id11430">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. My Crowne I am, but still my Griefes are mine:<br>

You may my Glories and my State depose,<br>

But not my Griefes; still am I King of those<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11431"> Bull. Part of your Cares you giue me with your Crowne</p><br>

<p id="id11432">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Your Cares set vp, do not pluck my Cares downe.<br>

My Care, is losse of Care, by old Care done,<br>

Your Care, is gaine of Care, by new Care wonne:<br>

The Cares I giue, I haue, though giuen away,<br>

They 'tend the Crowne, yet still with me they stay:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Are you contented to resigne the Crowne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. I, no; no, I: for I must nothing bee:<br>

Therefore no, no, for I resigne to thee.<br>

Now, marke me how I will vndoe my selfe.<br>

I giue this heauie Weight from off my Head,<br>

And this vnwieldie Scepter from my Hand,<br>

The pride of Kingly sway from out my Heart.<br>

With mine owne Teares I wash away my Balme,<br>

With mine owne Hands I giue away my Crowne,<br>

With mine owne Tongue denie my Sacred State,<br>

With mine owne Breath release all dutious Oathes;<br>

All Pompe and Maiestie I doe forsweare:<br>

My Manors, Rents, Reuenues, I forgoe;<br>

My Acts, Decrees, and Statutes I denie:<br>

God pardon all Oathes that are broke to mee,<br>

God keepe all Vowes vnbroke are made to thee.<br>

Make me that nothing haue, with nothing grieu'd,<br>

And thou with all pleas'd, that hast all atchieu'd.<br>

Long may'st thou liue in Richards Seat to sit,<br>

And soone lye Richard in an Earthie Pit.<br>

God saue King Henry, vn-King'd Richard sayes,<br>

And send him many yeeres of Sunne-shine dayes.<br>

What more remaines?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;North. No more: but that you reade<br>

These Accusations, and these grieuous Crymes,<br>

Committed by your Person, and your followers,<br>

Against the State, and Profit of this Land:<br>

That by confessing them, the Soules of men<br>

May deeme, that you are worthily depos'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11433">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Must I doe so? and must I rauell out<br>

My weau'd-vp follyes? Gentle Northumberland,<br>

If thy Offences were vpon Record,<br>

Would it not shame thee, in so faire a troupe,<br>

To reade a Lecture of them? If thou would'st,<br>

There should'st thou finde one heynous Article,<br>

Contayning the deposing of a King,<br>

And cracking the strong Warrant of an Oath,<br>

Mark'd with a Blot, damn'd in the Booke of Heauen.<br>

Nay, all of you, that stand and looke vpon me,<br>

Whil'st that my wretchednesse doth bait my selfe,<br>

Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,<br>

Shewing an outward pittie: yet you Pilates<br>

Haue here deliuer'd me to my sowre Crosse,<br>

And Water cannot wash away your sinne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11434"> North. My Lord dispatch, reade o're these Articles</p><br>

<p id="id11435">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Mine Eyes are full of Teares, I cannot see:<br>

And yet salt-Water blindes them not so much,<br>

But they can see a sort of Traytors here.<br>

Nay, if I turne mine Eyes vpon my selfe,<br>

I finde my selfe a Traytor with the rest:<br>

For I haue giuen here my Soules consent,<br>

T' vndeck the pompous Body of a King;<br>

Made Glory base; a Soueraigntie, a Slaue;<br>

Prowd Maiestie, a Subiect; State, a Pesant<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11436"> North. My Lord</p><br>

<p id="id11437">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. No Lord of thine, thou haught-insulting man;<br>

No, nor no mans Lord: I haue no Name, no Title;<br>

No, not that Name was giuen me at the Font,<br>

But 'tis vsurpt: alack the heauie day,<br>

That I haue worne so many Winters out,<br>

And know not now, what Name to call my selfe.<br>

Oh, that I were a Mockerie, King of Snow,<br>

Standing before the Sunne of Bullingbrooke,<br>

To melt my selfe away in Water-drops.<br>

Good King, great King, and yet not greatly good,<br>

And if my word be Sterling yet in England,<br>

Let it command a Mirror hither straight,<br>

That it may shew me what a Face I haue,<br>

Since it is Bankrupt of his Maiestie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11438"> Bull. Goe some of you, and fetch a Looking-Glasse</p><br>

<p id="id11439"> North. Read o're this Paper, while y Glasse doth come</p><br>

<p id="id11440"> Rich. Fiend, thou torments me, ere I come to Hell</p><br>

<p id="id11441"> Bull. Vrge it no more, my Lord Northumberland</p><br>

<p id="id11442"> North. The Commons will not then be satisfy'd</p><br>

<p id="id11443">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. They shall be satisfy'd: Ile reade enough,<br>

When I doe see the very Booke indeede,<br>

Where all my sinnes are writ, and that's my selfe.<br>

Enter one with a Glasse.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11444">Giue me that Glasse, and therein will I reade.<br>

No deeper wrinckles yet? hath Sorrow strucke<br>

So many Blowes vpon this Face of mine,<br>

And made no deeper Wounds? Oh flatt'ring Glasse,<br>

Like to my followers in prosperitie,<br>

Thou do'st beguile me. Was this Face, the Face<br>

That euery day, vnder his House-hold Roofe,<br>

Did keepe ten thousand men? Was this the Face,<br>

That like the Sunne, did make beholders winke?<br>

Is this the Face, which fac'd so many follyes,<br>

That was at last out-fac'd by Bullingbrooke?<br>

A brittle Glory shineth in this Face,<br>

As brittle as the Glory, is the Face,<br>

For there it is, crackt in an hundred shiuers.<br>

Marke silent King, the Morall of this sport,<br>

How soone my Sorrow hath destroy'd my Face<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11445">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. The shadow of your Sorrow hath destroy'd<br>

The shadow of your Face<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11446">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Say that againe.<br>

The shadow of my Sorrow: ha, let's see,<br>

'Tis very true, my Griefe lyes all within,<br>

And these externall manner of Laments,<br>

Are meerely shadowes, to the vnseene Griefe,<br>

That swells with silence in the tortur'd Soule.<br>

There lyes the substance: and I thanke thee King<br>

For thy great bountie, that not onely giu'st<br>

Me cause to wayle, but teachest me the way<br>

How to lament the cause. Ile begge one Boone,<br>

And then be gone, and trouble you no more.<br>

Shall I obtaine it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Name it, faire Cousin<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11447">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Faire Cousin? I am greater then a King:<br>

For when I was a King, my flatterers<br>

Were then but subiects; being now a subiect,<br>

I haue a King here to my flatterer:<br>

Being so great, I haue no neede to begge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11448"> Bull. Yet aske</p><br>

<p id="id11449">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. And shall I haue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. You shall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11450"> Rich. Then giue me leaue to goe</p><br>

<p id="id11451">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. Whither?<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id11452"> Bull. Goe some of you, conuey him to the Tower</p><br>

That rise thus nimbly by a true Kings fall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11454">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull. On Wednesday next, we solemnly set downe<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id11458">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aum. You holy Clergie-men, is there no Plot<br>

To rid the Realme of this pernicious Blot<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11459">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbot. Before I freely speake my minde herein,<br>

You shall not onely take the Sacrament,<br>

To bury mine intents, but also to effect<br>

What euer I shall happen to deuise.<br>

I see your Browes are full of Discontent,<br>

To Iulius C??sars ill-erected Tower:<br>

To whose flint Bosome, my condemned Lord<br>

Is doom'd a Prisoner, by prowd Bullingbrooke.<br>

Here let vs rest, if this rebellious Earth<br>

Ah thou, the Modell where old Troy did stand,<br>

Thou Mappe of Honor, thou King Richards Tombe,<br>

And not King Richard: thou most beauteous Inne,<br>

Why should hard-fauor'd Griefe be lodg'd in thee,<br>

When Triumph is become an Ale-house Guest<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11465">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Ioyne not with griefe, faire Woman, do not so,<br>

To make my end too sudden: learne good Soule,<br>

To thinke our former State a happie Dreame,<br>

From which awak'd, the truth of what we are,<br>

Shewes vs but this. I am sworne Brother (Sweet)<br>

To grim Necessitie; and hee and I<br>

Will keepe a League till Death. High thee to France,<br>

And Cloyster thee in some Religious House:<br>

Our holy liues must winne a new Worlds Crowne,<br>

Which our prophane houres here haue stricken downe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11466">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. What, is my Richard both in shape and minde<br>

Transform'd, and weaken'd? Hath Bullingbrooke<br>

Depos'd thine Intellect? hath he beene in thy Heart?<br>

The Lyon dying, thrusteth forth his Paw,<br>

And wounds the Earth, if nothing else, with rage<br>

To be o're-powr'd: and wilt thou, Pupill-like,<br>

Take thy Correction mildly, kisse the Rodde,<br>

And fawne on Rage with base Humilitie,<br>

Which art a Lyon, and a King of Beasts?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. A King of Beasts indeed: if aught but Beasts,<br>

I had beene still a happy King of Men.<br>

Good (sometime Queene) prepare thee hence for France:<br>

Thinke I am dead, and that euen here thou tak'st,<br>

As from my Death-bed, my last liuing leaue.<br>

In Winters tedious Nights sit by the fire<br>

With good old folkes, and let them tell thee Tales<br>

Of wofull Ages, long agoe betide:<br>

And ere thou bid good-night, to quit their griefe,<br>

Tell thou the lamentable fall of me,<br>

And send the hearers weeping to their Beds:<br>

For why? the sencelesse Brands will sympathize<br>

The heauie accent of thy mouing Tongue,<br>

And in compassion, weepe the fire out:<br>

And some will mourne in ashes, some coale-black,<br>

For the deposing of a rightfull King.<br>

Enter Northumberland.<br>

You must to Pomfret, not vnto the Tower.<br>

And Madame, there is order ta'ne for you:<br>

With all swift speed, you must away to France<br>
</p><br>

More then it is, ere foule sinne, gathering head,<br>

Shall breake into corruption: thou shalt thinke,<br>

Though he diuide the Realme, and giue thee halfe,<br>

It is too little, helping him to all:<br>

He shall thinke, that thou which know'st the way<br>

To plant vnrightfull Kings, wilt know againe,<br>

Being ne're so little vrg'd another way,<br>

To pluck him headlong from the vsurped Throne.<br>

The Loue of wicked friends conuerts to Feare;<br>

That Feare, to Hate; and Hate turnes one, or both,<br>

To worthie Danger, and deserued Death<br>

<p id="id11469">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. My guilt be on my Head, and there an end:<br>

Take leaue, and part, for you must part forthwith<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11470">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. Doubly diuorc'd? (bad men) ye violate<br>

A two-fold Marriage; 'twixt my Crowne, and me.<br>

And then betwixt me, and my marryed Wife.<br>

Let me vn-kisse the Oath 'twixt thee, and me;<br>

And yet not so, for with a Kisse 'twas made.<br>

Part vs, Northumberland: I, towards the North,<br>

Where shiuering Cold and Sicknesse pines the Clyme:<br>

My Queene to France: from whence, set forth in pompe,<br>

She came adorned hither like sweet May;<br>

Sent back like Hollowmas, or short'st of day<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11471">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. And must we be diuided? must we part?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. I, hand from hand (my Loue) and heart fro[m] heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11472"> Qu. Banish vs both, and send the King with me</p><br>

<p id="id11473"> North. That were some Loue, but little Pollicy</p><br>

<p id="id11474"> Qu. Then whither he goes, thither let me goe</p><br>

<p id="id11475">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. So two together weeping, make one Woe.<br>

Weepe thou for me in France; I, for thee heere:<br>

Better farre off, then neere, be ne're the neere.<br>

Goe, count thy Way with Sighes; I, mine with Groanes<br>

<p id="id11476"> Qu. So longest Way shall haue the longest Moanes</p><br>

And peece the Way out with a heauie heart.<br>

Come, come, in wooing Sorrow let's be briefe,<br>

Since wedding it, there is such length in Griefe:<br>

One Kisse shall stop our mouthes, and dumbely part;<br>

Thus giue I mine, and thus take I thy heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11478">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qu. Giue me mine owne againe: 'twere no good part,<br>

To take on me to keepe, and kill thy heart.<br>

So, now I haue mine owne againe, be gone,<br>

That I may striue to kill it with a groane<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11479">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. We make Woe wanton with this fond delay:<br>

Once more adieu; the rest, let Sorrow say.<br>

<p id="id11483">&nbsp;&nbsp;Duch. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,<br>

When weeping made you breake the story off,<br>

Of our two Cousins comming into London<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11484">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. Where did I leaue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Duch. At that sad stoppe, my Lord,<br>

Where rude mis-gouern'd hands, from Windowes tops,<br>

Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11485">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bullingbrooke,<br>

Mounted vpon a hot and fierie Steed,<br>

Which his aspiring Rider seem'd to know,<br>

With slow, but stately pace, kept on his course:<br>

While all tongues cride, God saue thee Bullingbrooke.<br>

You would haue thought the very windowes spake,<br>

So many greedy lookes of yong and old,<br>

Through Casements darted their desiring eyes<br>

Vpon his visage: and that all the walles,<br>

With painted Imagery had said at once,<br>

Iesu preserue thee, welcom Bullingbrooke.<br>

Whil'st he, from one side to the other turning,<br>

Bare-headed, lower then his proud Steeds necke,<br>

Bespake them thus: I thanke you Countrimen:<br>

And thus still doing, thus he past along<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11486">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dutch. Alas poore Richard, where rides he the whilst?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. As in a Theater, the eyes of men<br>

After a well grac'd Actor leaues the Stage,<br>

Are idlely bent on him that enters next,<br>

Thinking his prattle to be tedious:<br>

Euen so, or with much more contempt, mens eyes<br>

Did scowle on Richard: no man cride, God saue him:<br>

No ioyfull tongue gaue him his welcome home,<br>

But dust was throwne vpon his Sacred head,<br>

Which with such gentle sorrow he shooke off,<br>

His face still combating with teares and smiles<br>

(The badges of his greefe and patience)<br>

That had not God (for some strong purpose) steel'd<br>

The hearts of men, they must perforce haue melted,<br>

And Barbarisme it selfe haue pittied him.<br>

But heauen hath a hand in these euents,<br>

To whose high will we bound our calme contents.<br>

I will be satisfied, let me see the Writing<br>

<p id="id11496">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aum. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,<br>

It is a matter of small consequence,<br>

Which for some reasons I would not haue seene<br>

<p id="id11497">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. Which for some reasons sir, I meane to see:<br>

<p id="id11498">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. What should you feare?<br>

'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into<br>

For gay apparrell, against the Triumph<br>

That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a foole.<br>

<p id="id11500"> Aum. I do beseech you pardon me, I may not shew it</p><br>

Heauen for his mercy: what treachery is heere?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. Why, what is't my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorke. Giue me my boots, I say: Saddle my horse:<br>

Now by my Honor, my life, my troth,<br>

I will appeach the Villaine<br>

<p id="id11505">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. What is the matter?<br>

Wilt thou not hide the Trespasse of thine owne?<br>

Haue we more Sonnes? Or are we like to haue?<br>

Is not my teeming date drunke vp with time?<br>

And wilt thou plucke my faire Sonne from mine Age,<br>

And rob me of a happy Mothers name?<br>

Is he not like thee? Is he not thine owne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Thou fond mad woman:<br>

Wilt thou conceale this darke Conspiracy?<br>

A dozen of them heere haue tane the Sacrament,<br>

And interchangeably set downe their hands<br>

To kill the King at Oxford<br>

<p id="id11512">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. He shall be none:<br>

Wee'l keepe him heere: then what is that to him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor. Away fond woman: were hee twenty times my<br>

Son, I would appeach him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11513">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dut. Hadst thou groan'd for him as I haue done,<br>

Thou wouldest be more pittifull:<br>

But now I know thy minde; thou do'st suspect<br>

That I haue bene disloyall to thy bed,<br>

And that he is a Bastard, not thy Sonne:<br>

Sweet Yorke, sweet husband, be not of that minde:<br>

He is as like thee, as a man may bee,<br>

Not like to me, nor any of my Kin,<br>

If any plague hang ouer vs, 'tis he,<br>

I would to heauen (my Lords) he might be found:<br>

And weare it as a fauour, and with that<br>

He would vnhorse the lustiest Challenger<br>

His words come from his mouth, ours from our brest.<br>

He prayes but faintly, and would be denide,<br>

We pray with heart, and soule, and all beside:<br>

His weary ioynts would gladly rise, I know,<br>

Our knees shall kneele, till to the ground they grow:<br>

His prayers are full of false hypocrisie,<br>

Ours of true zeale, and deepe integritie:<br>

Pardon should be the first word of thy speach.<br>

I neuer long'd to heare a word till now:<br>

Say Pardon (King,) let pitty teach thee how.<br>

The word is short: but not so short as sweet,<br>

No word like Pardon, for Kings mouth's so meet<br>

That set's the word it selfe, against the word.<br>

Speake Pardon, as 'tis currant in our Land,<br>

The chopping French we do not vnderstand.<br>

Thine eye begins to speake, set thy tongue there,<br>

Or in thy pitteous heart, plant thou thine eare,<br>

That hearing how our plaints and prayres do pearce,<br>

Twice saying Pardon, doth not pardon twaine,<br>

<p id="id11573">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. I haue bin studying, how to compare<br>

This Prison where I liue, vnto the World:<br>

And for because the world is populous,<br>

And heere is not a Creature, but my selfe,<br>

I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer't out.<br>

My Braine, Ile proue the Female to my Soule,<br>

My Soule, the Father: and these two beget<br>

A generation of still breeding Thoughts;<br>

And these same Thoughts, people this Little World<br>

In humors, like the people of this world,<br>

For no thought is contented. The better sort,<br>

As thoughts of things Diuine, are intermixt<br>

With scruples, and do set the Faith it selfe<br>

Against the Faith: as thus: Come litle ones: &amp; then again,<br>

It is as hard to come, as for a Camell<br>

To thred the posterne of a Needles eye.<br>

Thoughts tending to Ambition, they do plot<br>

Vnlikely wonders; how these vaine weake nailes<br>

May teare a passage through the Flinty ribbes<br>

Of this hard world, my ragged prison walles:<br>

And for they cannot, dye in their owne pride.<br>

Thoughts tending to Content, flatter themselues,<br>

That they are not the first of Fortunes slaues,<br>

Nor shall not be the last. Like silly Beggars,<br>

Who sitting in the Stockes, refuge their shame<br>

That many haue, and others must sit there;<br>

And in this Thought, they finde a kind of ease,<br>

Bearing their owne misfortune on the backe<br>

Of such as haue before indur'd the like.<br>

Thus play I in one Prison, many people,<br>

And none contented. Sometimes am I King;<br>

Then Treason makes me wish my selfe a Beggar,<br>

And so I am. Then crushing penurie,<br>

Perswades me, I was better when a King:<br>

Then am I king'd againe: and by and by,<br>

Thinke that I am vn-king'd by Bullingbrooke,<br>

And straight am nothing. But what ere I am,<br>

Ha, ha? keepe time: How sowre sweet Musicke is,<br>

When Time is broke, and no Proportion kept?<br>

So is it in the Musicke of mens liues:<br>

And heere haue I the daintinesse of eare,<br>

To heare time broke in a disorder'd string:<br>

But for the Concord of my State and Time,<br>

Had not an eare to heare my true Time broke.<br>

I wasted Time, and now doth Time waste me:<br>

For now hath Time made me his numbring clocke;<br>

My Thoughts, are minutes; and with Sighes they iarre,<br>

Their watches on vnto mine eyes, the outward Watch,<br>

Whereto my finger, like a Dialls point,<br>

Is pointing still, in cleansing them from teares.<br>

Now sir, the sound that tels what houre it is,<br>

Are clamorous groanes, that strike vpon my heart,<br>

Which is the bell: so Sighes, and Teares, and Grones,<br>

Shew Minutes, Houres, and Times: but my Time<br>

Runs poasting on, in Bullingbrookes proud ioy,<br>

While I stand fooling heere, his iacke o'th' Clocke.<br>

This Musicke mads me, let it sound no more,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. First to thy Sacred State, wish I all happinesse:<br>

Two of the dangerous consorted Traitors,<br>

That sought at Oxford, thy dire ouerthrow<br>

Thy Kingly doome, and sentence of his pride<br>

<p id="id11599">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. Carlile, this is your doome:<br>

Choose out some secret place, some reuerend roome<br>

More then thou hast, and with it ioy thy life:<br>

So as thou liu'st in peace, dye free from strife:<br>

For though mine enemy, thou hast euer beene,<br>

High sparkes of Honor in thee haue I seene.<br>

Enter Exton with a Coffin.<br>

<p id="id11601">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. Exton, I thanke thee not, for thou hast wrought<br>

A deede of Slaughter, with thy fatall hand,<br>

Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,<br>

I hate the Murtherer, loue him murthered.<br>

The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,<br>

But neither my good word, nor Princely fauour.<br>

With Caine go wander through the shade of night,<br>

And neuer shew thy head by day, nor light.<br>

And put on sullen Blacke incontinent:<br>

Therefore we meete not now. Then let me heare<br>

Of you my gentle Cousin Westmerland,<br>

What yesternight our Councell did decree,<br>

In forwarding this deere expedience<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11612">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. My Liege: This haste was hot in question,<br>

And many limits of the Charge set downe<br>

But yesternight: when all athwart there came<br>

A Post from Wales, loaden with heauy Newes;<br>

Whose worst was, That the Noble Mortimer,<br>

Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br>

Against the irregular and wilde Glendower,<br>

Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<br>

And a thousand of his people butchered:<br>

Vpon whose dead corpes there was such misuse,<br>

Such beastly, shamelesse transformation,<br>

By those Welshwomen done, as may not be<br>

(Without much shame) re-told or spoken of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11613">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. It seemes then, that the tidings of this broile,<br>

Brake off our businesse for the Holy land<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11614">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. This matcht with other like, my gracious Lord,<br>

Farre more vneuen and vnwelcome Newes<br>

Came from the North, and thus it did report:<br>

On Holy-roode day, the gallant Hotspurre there,<br>

Young Harry Percy, and braue Archibald,<br>

That euer-valiant and approoued Scot,<br>

At Holmeden met, where they did spend<br>

A sad and bloody houre:<br>

As by discharge of their Artillerie,<br>

And shape of likely-hood the newes was told:<br>

For he that brought them, in the very heate<br>

And pride of their contention, did take horse,<br>

Vncertaine of the issue any way<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11615">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Heere is a deere and true industrious friend,<br>

Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his Horse,<br>

Strain'd with the variation of each soyle,<br>

Betwixt that Holmedon, and this Seat of ours:<br>

And he hath brought vs smooth and welcome newes.<br>

The Earle of Dowglas is discomfited,<br>

Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty Knights<br>

Balk'd in their owne blood did Sir Walter see<br>

On Holmedons Plaines. Of Prisoners, Hotspurre tooke<br>

Mordake Earle of Fife, and eldest sonne<br>

To beaten Dowglas, and the Earle of Atholl,<br>

Of Murry, Angus, and Menteith.<br>

And is not this an honourable spoyle?<br>

A gallant prize? Ha Cosin, is it not? Infaith it is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11616"> West. A Conquest for a Prince to boast of</p><br>

<p id="id11617">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, &amp; mak'st me sin,<br>

In enuy, that my Lord Northumberland<br>

Should be the Father of so blest a Sonne:<br>

A Sonne, who is the Theame of Honors tongue;<br>

Among'st a Groue, the very straightest Plant,<br>

Who is sweet Fortunes Minion, and her Pride:<br>

Whil'st I by looking on the praise of him,<br>

See Ryot and Dishonor staine the brow<br>

Of my yong Harry. O that it could be prou'd,<br>

That some Night-tripping-Faiery, had exchang'd<br>

In Cradle-clothes, our Children where they lay,<br>

And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet:<br>

Then would I haue his Harry, and he mine:<br>

But let him from my thoughts. What thinke you Coze<br>

Of this young Percies pride? The Prisoners<br>

Which he in this aduenture hath surpriz'd,<br>

To his owne vse he keepes, and sends me word<br>

I shall haue none but Mordake Earle of Fife<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11618">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. This is his Vnckles teaching. This is Worcester<br>

Maleuolent to you in all Aspects:<br>

Which makes him prune himselfe, and bristle vp<br>

The crest of Youth against your Dignity<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11619">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. But I haue sent for him to answer this:<br>

And for this cause a-while we must neglect<br>

Our holy purpose to Ierusalem.<br>

Cosin, on Wednesday next, our Councell we will hold<br>

At Windsor, and so informe the Lords:<br>

But come your selfe with speed to vs againe,<br>

For more is to be saide, and to be done,<br>

Then out of anger can be vttered<br>

<p id="id11623">Enter Henry Prince of Wales, Sir Iohn Falstaffe, and Pointz.</p><br>

<p id="id11624"> Fal. Now Hal, what time of day is it Lad?
 Prince. Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of olde
Sacke, and vnbuttoning thee after Supper, and sleeping
vpon Benches in the afternoone, that thou hast forgotten
to demand that truely, which thou wouldest truly know.
What a diuell hast thou to do with the time of the day?
vnlesse houres were cups of Sacke, and minutes Capons,
and clockes the tongues of Bawdes, and dialls the signes
of Leaping-houses, and the blessed Sunne himselfe a faire
hot Wench in Flame-coloured Taffata; I see no reason,
why thou shouldest bee so superfluous, to demaund the
time of the day</p><br>

<p id="id11625"> Fal. Indeed you come neere me now Hal, for we that
take Purses, go by the Moone and seuen Starres, and not
by Phoebus hee, that wand'ring Knight so faire. And I
prythee sweet Wagge, when thou art King, as God saue
thy Grace, Maiesty I should say, for Grace thou wilte
haue none</p><br>

<p id="id11626">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. What, none?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. No, not so much as will serue to be Prologue to<br>

an Egge and Butter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11627"> Prin. Well, how then? Come roundly, roundly</p><br>

<p id="id11628"> Fal. Marry then, sweet Wagge, when thou art King,
let not vs that are Squires of the Nights bodie, bee call'd
Theeues of the Dayes beautie. Let vs be Dianaes Forresters,
Gentlemen of the Shade, Minions of the Moone;
and let men say, we be men of good Gouernment, being
gouerned as the Sea, by our noble and chast mistris the
Moone, vnder whose countenance we steale</p><br>

<p id="id11629"> Prin. Thou say'st well, and it holds well too: for the
fortune of vs that are the Moones men, doeth ebbe and
flow like the Sea, beeing gouerned as the Sea is, by the
Moone: as for proofe. Now a Purse of Gold most resolutely
snatch'd on Monday night, and most dissolutely
spent on Tuesday Morning; got with swearing, Lay by:
and spent with crying, Bring in: now, in as low an ebbe
as the foot of the Ladder, and by and by in as high a flow
as the ridge of the Gallowes</p><br>

<p id="id11630"> Fal. Thou say'st true Lad: and is not my Hostesse of
the Tauerne a most sweet Wench?
 Prin. As is the hony, my old Lad of the Castle: and is
not a Buffe Ierkin a most sweet robe of durance?
 Fal. How now? how now mad Wagge? What in thy
quips and thy quiddities? What a plague haue I to doe
with a Buffe-Ierkin?
 Prin. Why, what a poxe haue I to doe with my Hostesse
of the Tauerne?
 Fal. Well, thou hast call'd her to a reck'ning many a
time and oft</p><br>

<p id="id11631">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Did I euer call for thee to pay thy part?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. No, Ile giue thee thy due, thou hast paid al there<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11632">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Yea and elsewhere, so farre as my Coine would<br>

stretch, and where it would not, I haue vs'd my credit<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11633"> Fal. Yea, and so vs'd it, that were it heere apparant,
that thou art Heire apparant. But I prythee sweet Wag,
shall there be Gallowes standing in England when thou
art King? and resolution thus fobb'd as it is, with the rustie
curbe of old Father Anticke the Law? Doe not thou
when thou art a King, hang a Theefe</p><br>

<p id="id11634"> Prin. No, thou shalt</p><br>

<p id="id11635"> Fal. Shall I? O rare! Ile be a braue Iudge</p><br>

<p id="id11636"> Prin. Thou iudgest false already. I meane, thou shalt
haue the hanging of the Theeues, and so become a rare
Hangman</p><br>

<p id="id11637"> Fal. Well Hal, well: and in some sort it iumpes with
my humour, as well as waiting in the Court, I can tell
you</p><br>

<p id="id11638">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. For obtaining of suites?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Yea, for obtaining of suites, whereof the Hangman<br>

hath no leane Wardrobe. I am as Melancholly as a<br>

Gyb-Cat, or a lugg'd Beare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11639"> Prin. Or an old Lyon, or a Louers Lute</p><br>

<p id="id11640"> Fal. Yea, or the Drone of a Lincolnshire Bagpipe</p><br>

<p id="id11641"> Prin. What say'st thou to a Hare, or the Melancholly
of Moore Ditch?
 Fal. Thou hast the most vnsauoury smiles, and art indeed
the most comparatiue rascallest sweet yong Prince.
But Hal, I prythee trouble me no more with vanity, I wold
thou and I knew, where a Commodity of good names
were to be bought: an olde Lord of the Councell rated
me the other day in the street about you sir; but I mark'd
him not, and yet hee talk'd very wisely, but I regarded
him not, and yet he talkt wisely, and in the street too</p><br>

<p id="id11642"> Prin. Thou didst well: for no man regards it</p><br>

<p id="id11643"> Fal. O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeede
able to corrupt a Saint. Thou hast done much harme vnto
me Hall, God forgiue thee for it. Before I knew thee
Hal, I knew nothing: and now I am (if a man shold speake
truly) little better then one of the wicked. I must giue ouer
this life, and I will giue it ouer: and I do not, I am a
Villaine. Ile be damn'd for neuer a Kings sonne in Christendome</p><br>

<p id="id11644">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Where shall we take a purse to morrow, Iacke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Where thou wilt Lad, Ile make one: and I doe<br>

not, call me Villaine, and baffle me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11645">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. I see a good amendment of life in thee: From<br>

Praying, to Purse-taking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11646">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Why, Hal, 'tis my Vocation Hal: 'Tis no sin for a<br>

man to labour in his Vocation<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11647">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointz. Now shall wee know if Gads hill haue set a<br>

Watch. O, if men were to be saued by merit, what hole<br>

in Hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent<br>

Villaine, that euer cryed, Stand, to a true man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11648"> Prin. Good morrow Ned</p><br>

<p id="id11649"> Poines. Good morrow sweet Hal. What saies Monsieur
remorse? What sayes Sir Iohn Sacke and Sugar:
Iacke? How agrees the Diuell and thee about thy Soule,
that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last, for a Cup of
Madera, and a cold Capons legge?
 Prin. Sir Iohn stands to his word, the diuel shall haue
his bargaine, for he was neuer yet a Breaker of Prouerbs:
He will giue the diuell his due</p><br>

<p id="id11650" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Poin. Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with
the diuell</p><br>

<p id="id11651"> Prin. Else he had damn'd cozening the diuell</p><br>

<p id="id11652"> Poy. But my Lads, my Lads, to morrow morning, by
foure a clocke early at Gads hill, there are Pilgrimes going
to Canterbury with rich Offerings, and Traders riding
to London with fat Purses. I haue vizards for you
all; you haue horses for your selues: Gads-hill lyes to
night in Rochester, I haue bespoke Supper to morrow in
Eastcheape; we may doe it as secure as sleepe: if you will
go, I will stuffe your Purses full of Crownes: if you will
not, tarry at home and be hang'd</p><br>

<p id="id11653">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Heare ye Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,<br>

Ile hang you for going<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11654"> Poy. You will chops</p><br>

<p id="id11655">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Hal, wilt thou make one?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Who, I rob? I a Theefe? Not I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11656"> Fal. There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship
in thee, nor thou cam'st not of the blood-royall,
if thou dar'st not stand for ten shillings</p><br>

<p id="id11657"> Prin. Well then, once in my dayes Ile be a mad-cap</p><br>

<p id="id11658"> Fal. Why, that's well said</p><br>

<p id="id11659"> Prin. Well, come what will, Ile tarry at home</p><br>

<p id="id11660"> Fal. Ile be a Traitor then, when thou art King</p><br>

<p id="id11661"> Prin. I care not</p><br>

<p id="id11662"> Poyn. Sir Iohn, I prythee leaue the Prince &amp; me alone,
I will lay him downe such reasons for this aduenture, that
he shall go</p><br>

<p id="id11663"> Fal. Well, maist thou haue the Spirit of perswasion;
and he the eares of profiting, that what thou speakest,
may moue; and what he heares may be beleeued, that the
true Prince, may (for recreation sake) proue a false theefe;
for the poore abuses of the time, want countenance. Farwell,
you shall finde me in Eastcheape</p><br>

<p id="id11664">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Farwell the latter Spring. Farewell Alhollown<br>

Summer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11665"> Poy. Now, my good sweet Hony Lord, ride with vs
to morrow. I haue a iest to execute, that I cannot mannage
alone. Falstaffe, Haruey, Rossill, and Gads-hill, shall
robbe those men that wee haue already way-layde, your
selfe and I, wil not be there: and when they haue the booty,
if you and I do not rob them, cut this head from my
shoulders</p><br>

<p id="id11666"> Prin. But how shal we part with them in setting forth?
 Poyn. Why, we wil set forth before or after them, and
appoint them a place of meeting, wherin it is at our pleasure
to faile; and then will they aduenture vppon the exploit
themselues, which they shall haue no sooner atchieued,
but wee'l set vpon them</p><br>

<p id="id11667"> Prin. I, but tis like that they will know vs by our
horses, by our habits, and by euery other appointment to
be our selues</p><br>

<p id="id11668"> Poy. Tut our horses they shall not see, Ile tye them in
the wood, our vizards wee will change after wee leaue
them: and sirrah, I haue Cases of Buckram for the nonce,
to immaske our noted outward garments</p><br>

<p id="id11669"> Prin. But I doubt they will be too hard for vs</p><br>

<p id="id11670"> Poin. Well, for two of them, I know them to bee as
true bred Cowards as euer turn'd backe: and for the third
if he fight longer then he sees reason, Ile forswear Armes.
The vertue of this Iest will be, the incomprehensible lyes
that this fat Rogue will tell vs, when we meete at Supper:
how thirty at least he fought with, what Wardes, what
blowes, what extremities he endured; and in the reproofe
of this, lyes the iest</p><br>

<p id="id11671"> Prin. Well, Ile goe with thee, prouide vs all things
necessary, and meete me to morrow night in Eastcheape,
there Ile sup. Farewell</p><br>

<p id="id11672"> Poyn. Farewell, my Lord.</p><br>

<p id="id11673">Exit Pointz</p><br>

<p id="id11674">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. I know you all, and will a-while vphold<br>

The vnyoak'd humor of your idlenesse:<br>

Yet heerein will I imitate the Sunne,<br>

Who doth permit the base contagious cloudes<br>

To smother vp his Beauty from the world,<br>

That when he please againe to be himselfe,<br>

Being wanted, he may be more wondred at,<br>

By breaking through the foule and vgly mists<br>

Of vapours, that did seeme to strangle him.<br>

If all the yeare were playing holidaies,<br>

To sport, would be as tedious as to worke;<br>

But when they seldome come, they wisht-for come,<br>

And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.<br>

So when this loose behauiour I throw off,<br>

And pay the debt I neuer promised;<br>

By how much better then my word I am,<br>

By so much shall I falsifie mens hopes,<br>

And like bright Mettall on a sullen ground:<br>

My reformation glittering o're my fault,<br>

Shall shew more goodly, and attract more eyes,<br>

Then that which hath no foyle to set it off.<br>

Ile so offend, to make offence a skill,<br>

Redeeming time, when men thinke least I will.<br>

Vnapt to stirre at these indignities,<br>

And you haue found me; for accordingly,<br>

You tread vpon my patience: But be sure,<br>

I will from henceforth rather be my Selfe,<br>

Mighty, and to be fear'd, then my condition<br>

Which hath beene smooth as Oyle, soft as yong Downe,<br>

And therefore lost that Title of respect,<br>

Which the proud soule ne're payes, but to the proud<br>

Danger and disobedience in thine eye.<br>

O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,<br>

And Maiestie might neuer yet endure<br>

The moody Frontier of a seruant brow,<br>

You haue good leaue to leaue vs. When we need<br>

Your vse and counsell, we shall send for you.<br>

You were about to speake<br>

Those Prisoners in your Highnesse demanded,<br>

Which Harry Percy heere at Holmedon tooke,<br>

Were (as he sayes) not with such strength denied<br>

As was deliuered to your Maiesty:<br>

Who either through enuy, or misprision,<br>

Was guilty of this fault; and not my Sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11682">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. My Liege, I did deny no Prisoners.<br>

But, I remember when the fight was done,<br>

When I was dry with Rage, and extreame Toyle,<br>

Breathlesse, and Faint, leaning vpon my Sword,<br>

Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly drest;<br>

Fresh as a Bride-groome, and his Chin new reapt,<br>

Shew'd like a stubble Land at Haruest home.<br>

He was perfumed like a Milliner,<br>

And 'twixt his Finger and his Thumbe, he held<br>

A Pouncet-box: which euer and anon<br>

He gaue his Nose, and took't away againe:<br>

Who therewith angry, when it next came there,<br>

Tooke it in Snuffe. And still he smil'd and talk'd:<br>

And as the Souldiers bare dead bodies by,<br>

He call'd them vntaught Knaues, Vnmannerly,<br>

To bring a slouenly vnhandsome Coarse<br>

Betwixt the Winde, and his Nobility.<br>

With many Holiday and Lady tearme<br>

He question'd me: Among the rest, demanded<br>

My Prisoners, in your Maiesties behalfe.<br>

I then, all-smarting, with my wounds being cold,<br>

(To be so pestered with a Popingay)<br>

Out of my Greefe, and my Impatience,<br>

Answer'd (neglectingly) I know not what,<br>

He should, or should not: For he made me mad,<br>

To see him shine so briske, and smell so sweet,<br>

And talke so like a Waiting-Gentlewoman,<br>

Of Guns, &amp; Drums, and Wounds: God saue the marke;<br>

And telling me, the Soueraign'st thing on earth<br>

Was Parmacity, for an inward bruise:<br>

And that it was great pitty, so it was,<br>

That villanous Salt-peter should be digg'd<br>

Out of the Bowels of the harmlesse Earth,<br>

Which many a good Tall Fellow had destroy'd<br>

So Cowardly. And but for these vile Gunnes,<br>

He would himselfe haue beene a Souldier.<br>

This bald, vnioynted Chat of his (my Lord)<br>

Made me to answer indirectly (as I said.)<br>

And I beseech you, let not this report<br>

Come currant for an Accusation,<br>

Betwixt my Loue, and your high Maiesty<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11683">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunt. The circumstance considered, good my Lord,<br>

What euer Harry Percie then had said,<br>

To such a person, and in such a place,<br>

At such a time, with all the rest retold,<br>

May reasonably dye, and neuer rise<br>

To do him wrong, or any way impeach<br>

What then he said, so he vnsay it now<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11684">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Why yet doth deny his Prisoners,<br>

But with Prouiso and Exception,<br>

That we at our owne charge, shall ransome straight<br>

His Brother-in-Law, the foolish Mortimer,<br>

Who (in my soule) hath wilfully betraid<br>

The liues of those, that he did leade to Fight,<br>

Against the great Magitian, damn'd Glendower:<br>

Whose daughter (as we heare) the Earle of March<br>

Hath lately married. Shall our Coffers then,<br>

Be emptied, to redeeme a Traitor home?<br>

Shall we buy Treason? and indent with Feares,<br>

When they haue lost and forfeyted themselues.<br>

No: on the barren Mountaine let him sterue:<br>

For I shall neuer hold that man my Friend,<br>

Whose tongue shall aske me for one peny cost<br>

To ransome home reuolted Mortimer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11685">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Reuolted Mortimer?<br>

He neuer did fall off, my Soueraigne Liege,<br>

But by the chance of Warre: to proue that true,<br>

Needs no more but one tongue. For all those Wounds,<br>

Those mouthed Wounds, which valiantly he tooke,<br>

When on the gentle Seuernes siedgie banke,<br>

In single Opposition hand to hand,<br>

He did confound the best part of an houre<br>

In changing hardiment with great Glendower:<br>

Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink<br>

Vpon agreement, of swift Seuernes flood;<br>

Who then affrighted with their bloody lookes,<br>

Ran fearefully among the trembling Reeds,<br>

And hid his crispe-head in the hollow banke,<br>

Blood-stained with these Valiant Combatants.<br>

Neuer did base and rotten Policy<br>

Colour her working with such deadly wounds;<br>

Nor neuer could the Noble Mortimer<br>

Receiue so many, and all willingly:<br>

Then let him not be sland'red with Reuolt<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11686">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Thou do'st bely him Percy, thou dost bely him;<br>

He neuer did encounter with Glendower:<br>

I tell thee, he durst as well haue met the diuell alone,<br>

As Owen Glendower for an enemy.<br>

Art thou not asham'd? But Sirrah, henceforth<br>

Let me not heare you speake of Mortimer.<br>

Send me your Prisoners with the speediest meanes,<br>

Or you shall heare in such a kinde from me<br>

As will displease ye. My Lord Northumberland,<br>

We License your departure with your sonne,<br>

Send vs your Prisoners, or you'l heare of it.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11687">Exit King.</p><br>

<p id="id11688">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. And if the diuell come and roare for them<br>

I will not send them. I will after straight<br>

And tell him so: for I will ease my heart,<br>

Although it be with hazard of my head<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11689">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. What? drunke with choller? stay &amp; pause awhile,<br>

Heere comes your Vnckle.<br>

Enter Worcester.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11690">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Speake of Mortimer?<br>

Yes, I will speake of him, and let my soule<br>

Want mercy, if I do not ioyne with him.<br>

In his behalfe, Ile empty all these Veines,<br>

And shed my deere blood drop by drop i'th dust,<br>

But I will lift the downfall Mortimer<br>

As high i'th Ayre, as this Vnthankfull King,<br>

As this Ingrate and Cankred Bullingbrooke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11691">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Brother, the King hath made your Nephew mad<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Who strooke this heate vp after I was gone?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. He will (forsooth) haue all my Prisoners:<br>

And when I vrg'd the ransom once againe<br>

Of my Wiues Brother, then his cheeke look'd pale,<br>

And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,<br>

Trembling euen at the name of Mortimer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11692">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. I cannot blame him: was he not proclaim'd<br>

By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. He was: I heard the Proclamation,<br>

And then it was, when the vnhappy King<br>

(Whose wrongs in vs God pardon) did set forth<br>

Vpon his Irish Expedition:<br>

From whence he intercepted, did returne<br>

To be depos'd, and shortly murthered<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11693">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. And for whose death, we in the worlds wide mouth<br>

Liue scandaliz'd, and fouly spoken of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11694">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. But soft I pray you; did King Richard then<br>

Proclaime my brother Mortimer,<br>

Heyre to the Crowne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. He did, my selfe did heare it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11695">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Nay then I cannot blame his Cousin King,<br>

That wish'd him on the barren Mountaines staru'd.<br>

But shall it be, that you that set the Crowne<br>

Vpon the head of this forgetfull man,<br>

And for his sake, wore the detested blot<br>

Of murtherous subornation? Shall it be,<br>

That you a world of curses vndergoe,<br>

Being the Agents, or base second meanes,<br>

The Cords, the Ladder, or the Hangman rather?<br>

O pardon, if that I descend so low,<br>

To shew the Line, and the Predicament<br>

Wherein you range vnder this subtill King.<br>

Shall it for shame, be spoken in these dayes,<br>

Or fill vp Chronicles in time to come,<br>

That men of your Nobility and Power,<br>

Did gage them both in an vniust behalfe<br>

(As Both of you, God pardon it, haue done)<br>

To put downe Richard, that sweet louely Rose,<br>

And plant this Thorne, this Canker Bullingbrooke?<br>

And shall it in more shame be further spoken,<br>

That you are fool'd, discarded, and shooke off<br>

By him, for whom these shames ye vnderwent?<br>

No: yet time serues, wherein you may redeeme<br>

Your banish'd Honors, and restore your selues<br>

Into the good Thoughts of the world againe.<br>

Reuenge the geering and disdain'd contempt<br>

Of this proud King, who studies day and night<br>

To answer all the Debt he owes vnto you,<br>

Euen with the bloody Payment of your deaths:<br>

Therefore I say-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Peace Cousin, say no more.<br>

And now I will vnclaspe a Secret booke,<br>

And to your quicke conceyuing Discontents,<br>

Ile reade you Matter, deepe and dangerous,<br>

As full of perill and aduenturous Spirit,<br>

As to o're-walke a Current, roaring loud<br>

On the vnstedfast footing of a Speare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11696">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. If he fall in, good night, or sinke or swimme:<br>

Send danger from the East vnto the West,<br>

So Honor crosse it from the North to South,<br>

And let them grapple: The blood more stirres<br>

To rowze a Lyon, then to start a Hare<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11697">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Imagination of some great exploit,<br>

Driues him beyond the bounds of Patience<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11698">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. By heauen, me thinkes it were an easie leap,<br>

To plucke bright Honor from the pale-fac'd Moone,<br>

Or diue into the bottome of the deepe,<br>

Where Fadome-line could neuer touch the ground,<br>

And plucke vp drowned Honor by the Lockes:<br>

So he that doth redeeme her thence, might weare<br>

Without Co-riuall, all her Dignities:<br>

But out vpon this halfe-fac'd Fellowship<br>

<p id="id11699">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. He apprehends a World of Figures here,<br>

But not the forme of what he should attend:<br>

Good Cousin giue me audience for a-while,<br>

And list to me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11700"> Hot. I cry you mercy</p><br>

<p id="id11701">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Those same Noble Scottes<br>

That are your Prisoners<br>

By heauen, he shall not haue a Scot of them:<br>

No, if a Scot would saue his Soule, he shall not.<br>

Ile keepe them, by this Hand<br>

<p id="id11703">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. You start away,<br>

And lend no eare vnto my purposes.<br>

Those Prisoners you shall keepe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11704">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Nay, I will: that's flat:<br>

He said, he would not ransome Mortimer:<br>

Forbad my tongue to speake of Mortimer.<br>

But I will finde him when he lyes asleepe,<br>

And in his eare, Ile holla Mortimer.<br>

Nay, Ile haue a Starling shall be taught to speake<br>

Nothing but Mortimer, and giue it him,<br>

To keepe his anger still in motion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11705"> Wor. Heare you Cousin: a word</p><br>

<p id="id11706">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. All studies heere I solemnly defie,<br>

Saue how to gall and pinch this Bullingbrooke,<br>

And that same Sword and Buckler Prince of Wales.<br>

But that I thinke his Father loues him not,<br>

And would be glad he met with some mischance,<br>

I would haue poyson'd him with a pot of Ale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11707">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Farewell Kinsman: Ile talke to you<br>

When you are better temper'd to attend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11708">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Why what a Waspe-tongu'd &amp; impatient foole<br>

Art thou, to breake into this Womans mood,<br>

Tying thine eare to no tongue but thine owne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Why look you, I am whipt &amp; scourg'd with rods,<br>

Netled, and stung with Pismires, when I heare<br>

Of this vile Politician Bullingbrooke.<br>

In Richards time: What de'ye call the place?<br>

A plague vpon't, it is in Gloustershire:<br>

'Twas, where the madcap Duke his Vncle kept,<br>

His Vncle Yorke, where I first bow'd my knee<br>

Vnto this King of Smiles, this Bullingbrooke:<br>

When you and he came backe from Rauenspurgh<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11709"> Nor. At Barkley Castle</p><br>

<p id="id11710">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. You say true:<br>

Why what a caudie deale of curtesie,<br>

This fawning Grey-hound then did proffer me,<br>

Looke when his infant Fortune came to age,<br>

And gentle Harry Percy, and kinde Cousin:<br>

O, the Diuell take such Couzeners, God forgiue me,<br>

Good Vncle tell your tale, for I haue done<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11711">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Nay, if you haue not, too't againe,<br>

Wee'l stay your leysure<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11712"> Hot. I haue done insooth</p><br>

<p id="id11713">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Then once more to your Scottish Prisoners.<br>

Deliuer them vp without their ransome straight,<br>

And make the Dowglas sonne your onely meane<br>

For powres in Scotland: which for diuers reasons<br>

Which I shall send you written, be assur'd<br>

Will easily be granted you, my Lord.<br>

Your Sonne in Scotland being thus imploy'd,<br>

Shall secretly into the bosome creepe<br>

Of that same noble Prelate, well belou'd,<br>

The Archbishop<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11714">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Of Yorke, is't not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. True, who beares hard<br>

His Brothers death at Bristow, the Lord Scroope.<br>

I speake not this in estimation,<br>

As what I thinke might be, but what I know<br>

Is ruminated, plotted, and set downe,<br>

And onely stayes but to behold the face<br>

Of that occasion that shall bring it on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11715">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. I smell it:<br>

Vpon my life, it will do wond'rous well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11716"> Nor. Before the game's a-foot, thou still let'st slip</p><br>

<p id="id11717">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Why, it cannot choose but be a Noble plot,<br>

And then the power of Scotland, and of Yorke<br>

To ioyne with Mortimer, Ha<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11718"> Wor. And so they shall</p><br>

<p id="id11719"> Hot. Infaith it is exceedingly well aym'd</p><br>

<p id="id11720">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. And 'tis no little reason bids vs speed,<br>

To saue our heads, by raising of a Head:<br>

For, beare our selues as euen as we can,<br>

The King will alwayes thinke him in our debt,<br>

And thinke, we thinke our selues vnsatisfied,<br>

Till he hath found a time to pay vs home.<br>

And see already, how he doth beginne<br>

To make vs strangers to his lookes of loue<br>

Then I by Letters shall direct your course<br>

When time is ripe, which will be sodainly:<br>

Ile steale to Glendower, and loe, Mortimer,<br>

Where you, and Dowglas, and our powres at once,<br>

As I will fashion it, shall happily meete,<br>

To beare our fortunes in our owne strong armes,<br>

Which now we hold at much vncertainty<br>

<p id="id11748"> Cham. Good morrow Master Gads-Hill, it holds currant
that I told you yesternight. There's a Franklin in the

of charge too (God knowes what) they are vp already,

<p id="id11751"> Gad. What talkest thou to me of the Hangman? If I
hang, Ile make a fat payre of Gallowes. For, if I hang,
old Sir Iohn hangs with mee, and thou know'st hee's no
Starueling. Tut, there are other Troians that y dream'st
not of, the which (for sport sake) are content to doe the
Profession some grace; that would (if matters should bee
look'd into) for their owne Credit sake, make all Whole.
I am ioyned with no Foot-land-Rakers, No Long-staffe
six-penny strikers, none of these mad
Mustachio-purple-hu'd-Maltwormes,
but with Nobility, and Tranquilitie;
Bourgomasters, and great Oneyers, such as can holde in,
such as will strike sooner then speake; and speake sooner
then drinke, and drinke sooner then pray: and yet I lye,
for they pray continually vnto their Saint the Commonwealth;
or rather, not to pray to her, but prey on her: for
they ride vp &amp; downe on her, and make hir their Boots</p><br>

<p id="id11799"> Prince. Got with much ease. Now merrily to Horse:
The Theeues are scattred, and possest with fear so strongly,
that they dare not meet each other: each takes his fellow
for an Officer. Away good Ned, Falstaffe sweates to
death, and Lards the leane earth as he walkes along: wer't
not for laughing, I should pitty him</p><br>

<p id="id11804">But for mine owne part, my Lord. I could bee well contented to
be there, in respect of the loue I beare your house.
He could be contented: Why is he not then? in respect of
the loue he beares our house. He shewes in this, he loues
his owne Barne better then he loues our house. Let me
see some more. The purpose you vndertake is dangerous.
Why that's certaine: 'Tis dangerous to take a Colde, to
sleepe, to drinke: but I tell you (my Lord foole) out of
this Nettle, Danger; we plucke this Flower, Safety. The
purpose you vndertake is dangerous, the Friends you haue named
vncertaine, the Time it selfe vnsorted, and your whole
Plot too light, for the counterpoize of so great an Opposition.
Say you so, say you so: I say vnto you againe, you are a
shallow cowardly Hinde, and you Lye. What a lackebraine
is this? I protest, our plot is as good a plot as euer
was laid; our Friend true and constant: A good Plotte,
good Friends, and full of expectation: An excellent plot,
very good Friends. What a Frosty-spirited rogue is this?
Why, my Lord of Yorke commends the plot, and the
generall course of the action. By this hand, if I were now
by this Rascall, I could braine him with his Ladies Fan.
Is there not my Father, my Vncle, and my Selfe, Lord
Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of Yorke, and Owen Glendour?
Is there not besides, the Dowglas? Haue I not all their letters,
to meete me in Armes by the ninth of the next Moneth?
and are they not some of them set forward already?
What a Pagan Rascall is this? An Infidell. Ha, you shall
see now in very sincerity of Feare and Cold heart, will he
to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could
diuide my selfe, and go to buffets, for mouing such a dish
of skim'd Milk with so honourable an Action. Hang him,
let him tell the King we are prepared. I will set forwards
to night.
Enter his Lady.</p><br>

<p id="id11805">How now Kate, I must leaue you within these two hours</p><br>

<p id="id11806">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. O my good Lord, why are you thus alone?<br>

For what offence haue I this fortnight bin<br>

A banish'd woman from my Harries bed?<br>

Tell me (sweet Lord) what is't that takes from thee<br>

Thy stomacke, pleasure, and thy golden sleepe?<br>

Why dost thou bend thine eyes vpon the earth?<br>

And start so often when thou sitt'st alone?<br>

Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheekes?<br>

And giuen my Treasures and my rights of thee,<br>

To thicke-ey'd musing, and curst melancholly?<br>

In my faint-slumbers, I by thee haue watcht,<br>

And heard thee murmore tales of Iron Warres:<br>

Speake tearmes of manage to thy bounding Steed,<br>

Cry courage to the field. And thou hast talk'd<br>

Of Sallies, and Retires; Trenches, Tents,<br>

Of Palizadoes, Frontiers, Parapets,<br>

Of Basiliskes, of Canon, Culuerin,<br>

Of Prisoners ransome, and of Souldiers slaine,<br>

And all the current of a headdy fight.<br>

Thy spirit within thee hath beene so at Warre,<br>

And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleepe,<br>

That beds of sweate hath stood vpon thy Brow,<br>

Like bubbles in a late-disturbed Streame;<br>

And in thy face strange motions haue appear'd,<br>

Such as we see when men restraine their breath<br>

On some great sodaine hast. O what portents are these?<br>

Some heauie businesse hath my Lord in hand,<br>

And I must know it: else he loues me not<br>

<p id="id11809"> Hot. What Horse? A Roane, a crop eare, is it not</p><br>

<p id="id11810"> Ser. It is my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id11811"> Hot. That Roane shall be my Throne. Well, I will

<p id="id11814"> La. Out you mad-headed Ape, a Weazell hath not
such a deale of Spleene, as you are tost with. In sooth Ile
know your businesse Harry, that I will. I feare my Brother
Mortimer doth stirre about his Title, and hath sent
for you to line his enterprize. But if you go-
 Hot. So farre a foot, I shall be weary, Loue</p><br>

<p id="id11815"> La. Come, come, you Paraquito, answer me directly

thy little finger Harry, if thou wilt not tel me true</p><br>

<p id="id11816">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Away, away you trifler: Loue, I loue thee not,<br>

I care not for thee Kate: this is no world<br>

To play with Mammets, and to tilt with lips.<br>

We must haue bloodie Noses, and crack'd Crownes,<br>

And passe them currant too. Gods me, my horse.<br>

What say'st thou Kate? what wold'st thou haue with me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;La. Do ye not loue me? Do ye not indeed?<br>

Well, do not then. For since you loue me not,<br>

I will not loue my selfe. Do you not loue me?<br>

Nay, tell me if thou speak'st in iest, or no<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Come, wilt thou see me ride?<br>

And when I am a horsebacke, I will sweare<br>

I loue thee infinitely. But hearke you Kate,<br>

I must not haue you henceforth, question me,<br>

Whether I go: nor reason whereabout.<br>

Whether I must, I must: and to conclude,<br>

This Euening must I leaue thee, gentle Kate.<br>

I know you wise, but yet no further wise<br>

Then Harry Percies wife. Constant you are,<br>

But yet a woman: and for secrecie,<br>

No Lady closer. For I will beleeue<br>

Thou wilt not vtter what thou do'st not know,<br>

And so farre wilt I trust thee, gentle Kate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La. How so farre?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Not an inch further. But harke you Kate,<br>

Whither I go, thither shall you go too:<br>

To day will I set forth, to morrow you.<br>

Will this content you Kate?<br>

<p id="id11823"> Poines. Where hast bene Hall?
 Prin. With three or foure Logger-heads, amongst 3.
or fourescore Hogsheads. I haue sounded the verie base
string of humility. Sirra, I am sworn brother to a leash of
Drawers, and can call them by their names, as Tom, Dicke,
and Francis. They take it already vpon their confidence,
that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the King
of Curtesie: telling me flatly I am no proud Iack like Falstaffe,
but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, and
when I am King of England, I shall command al the good
Laddes in East-cheape. They call drinking deepe, dying
Scarlet; and when you breath in your watering, then
they cry hem, and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am
so good a proficient in one quarter of an houre, that I can
drinke with any Tinker in his owne Language during my
life. I tell thee Ned, thou hast lost much honor, that thou
wer't not with me in this action: but sweet Ned, to sweeten
which name of Ned, I giue thee this peniworth of Sugar,
clapt euen now into my hand by an vnder Skinker,
one that neuer spake other English in his life, then Eight
shillings and six pence, and, You are welcome: with this shril
addition, Anon, Anon sir, Score a Pint of Bastard in the
Halfe Moone, or so. But Ned, to driue away time till Falstaffe
come, I prythee doe thou stand in some by-roome,
while I question my puny Drawer, to what end hee gaue
me the Sugar, and do neuer leaue calling Francis, that his
Tale to me may be nothing but, Anon: step aside, and Ile

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran. O Lord sir, I would it had bene two<br>

<p id="id11838">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. I will giue thee for it a thousand pound: Aske<br>

 Prin. I am now of all humors, that haue shewed themselues
humors, since the old dayes of goodman Adam, to
the pupill age of this present twelue a clock at midnight.
What's a clocke Francis?
 Fran. Anon, anon sir</p><br>

<p id="id11852"> Prin. That euer this Fellow should haue fewer words
then a Parret, and yet the sonne of a Woman. His industry
is vp-staires and down-staires, his eloquence the parcell
of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percies mind, the Hotspurre
of the North, he that killes me some sixe or seauen
dozen of Scots at a Breakfast, washes his hands, and saies
to his wife; Fie vpon this quiet life, I want worke. O my
sweet Harry sayes she, how many hast thou kill'd to day?
Giue my Roane horse a drench (sayes hee) and answeres,
some fourteene, an houre after: a trifle, a trifle. I prethee
call in Falstaffe, Ile play Percy, and that damn'd Brawne
shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. Riuo, sayes the drunkard.
Call in Ribs, call in Tallow.
Enter Falstaffe.</p><br>

<p id="id11853"> Poin. Welcome Iacke, where hast thou beene?
 Fal. A plague of all Cowards I say, and a Vengeance

I leade this life long, Ile sowe nether stockes, and mend
them too. A plague of all cowards. Giue me a Cup of
Sacke, Rogue. Is there no Vertue extant?
 Prin. Didst thou neuer see Titan kisse a dish of Butter,
pittifull hearted Titan that melted at the sweete Tale of
the Sunne? If thou didst, then behold that compound</p><br>

<p id="id11854"> Fal. You Rogue, heere's Lime in this Sacke too: there
is nothing but Roguery to be found in Villanous man; yet
a Coward is worse then a Cup of Sack with lime. A villanous
Coward, go thy wayes old Iacke, die when thou
wilt, if manhood, good manhood be not forgot vpon the
face of the earth, then am I a shotten Herring: there liues
not three good men vnhang'd in England, &amp; one of them
is fat, and growes old, God helpe the while, a bad world I
say. I would I were a Weauer, I could sing all manner of
songs. A plague of all Cowards, I say still</p><br>

<p id="id11855">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. How now Woolsacke, what mutter you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. A Kings Sonne? If I do not beate thee out of thy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Are you not a Coward? Answer me to that, and<br>

<p id="id11863"> Prince. What, a hundred, man?
 Falst. I am a Rogue, if I were not at halfe Sword with
a dozen of them two houres together. I haue scaped by
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the Doublet,
foure through the Hose, my Buckler cut through and
through, my Sword hackt like a Hand-saw, ecce signum.
I neuer dealt better since I was a man: all would not doe.
A plague of all Cowards: let them speake; if they speake
more or lesse then truth, they are villaines, and the sonnes
of darknesse</p><br>

<p id="id11864">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Speake sirs, how was it?<br>

out of two?
 Falst. But as the Deuill would haue it, three mis-begotten
Knaues, in Kendall Greene, came at my Back, and
let driue at me; for it was so darke, Hal, that thou could'st
not see thy Hand</p><br>

<p id="id11890"> Prin. These Lyes are like the Father that begets them,
grosse as a Mountaine, open, palpable. Why thou Claybrayn'd

Kendall Greene, when it was so darke, thou could'st not<br>

see thy Hand? Come, tell vs your reason: what say'st thou<br>

to this?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. Come, your reason Iack, your reason<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11892"> Falst. What, vpon compulsion? No: were I at the
Strappado, or all the Racks in the World, I would not
tell you on compulsion. Giue you a reason on compulsion?
If Reasons were as plentie as Black-berries, I would
giue no man a Reason vpon compulsion, I</p><br>

<p id="id11893"> Prin. Ile be no longer guiltie of this sinne. This sanguine
Coward, this Bed-presser, this Hors-back-breaker,

Neats tongue, Bulles-pissell, you stocke-fish: O for breth

<p id="id11897"> Prin. We two, saw you foure set on foure and bound
them, and were Masters of their Wealth: mark now how
a plaine Tale shall put you downe. Then did we two, set
on you foure, and with a word, outfac'd you from your
prize, and haue it: yea, and can shew it you in the House.
And Falstaffe, you caried your Guts away as nimbly, with
as quicke dexteritie, and roared for mercy, and still ranne
and roar'd, as euer I heard Bull-Calfe. What a Slaue art
thou, to hacke thy sword as thou hast done, and then say
it was in fight. What trick? what deuice? what starting
hole canst thou now find out, to hide thee from this open
and apparant shame?
 Poines. Come, let's heare Iacke: What tricke hast
thou now?
 Fal. I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why heare
ye my Masters, was it for me to kill the Heire apparant?
Should I turne vpon the true Prince? Why, thou knowest
I am as valiant as Hercules: but beware Instinct, the Lion
will not touch the true Prince: Instinct is a great matter.
I was a Coward on Instinct: I shall thinke the better of
my selfe, and thee, during my life: I, for a valiant Lion,
and thou for a true Prince. But Lads, I am glad you haue
the Mony. Hostesse, clap to the doores: watch to night,
pray to morrow. Gallants, Lads, Boyes, Harts of Gold,

<p id="id11908"> Prin. Tell mee now in earnest, how came Falstaffes
Sword so hackt?
 Peto. Why, he hackt it with his Dagger, and said, hee
would sweare truth out of England, but hee would make
you beleeue it was done in fight, and perswaded vs to doe
the like</p><br>

<p id="id11909"> Bard. Yea, and to tickle our Noses with Spear-grasse,
to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
with it, and sweare it was the blood of true men. I did
that I did not this seuen yeeres before, I blusht to heare
his monstrous deuices</p><br>

<p id="id11910">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. O Villaine, thou stolest a Cup of Sacke eighteene<br>

yeeres agoe, and wert taken with the manner, and<br>

euer since thou hast blusht extempore: thou hadst fire<br>

and sword on thy side, and yet thou ranst away; what<br>

instinct hadst thou for it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. My Lord, doe you see these Meteors? doe you<br>

behold these Exhalations?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. I doe<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. What thinke you they portend?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Hot Liuers, and cold Purses<br>

Iacke, since thou saw'st thine owne Knee?
 Falst. My owne Knee? When I was about thy yeeres
(Hal) I was not an Eagles Talent in the Waste, I could
haue crept into any Aldermans Thumbe-Ring: a plague
of sighing and griefe, it blowes a man vp like a Bladder.
There's villanous Newes abroad; heere was Sir Iohn
Braby from your Father; you must goe to the Court in
the Morning. The same mad fellow of the North, Percy;
and hee of Wales, that gaue Amamon the Bastinado,
and made Lucifer Cuckold, and swore the Deuill his true
Liege-man vpon the Crosse of a Welch-hooke; what a
plague call you him?

<p id="id11923"> Falst. By the Masse Lad, thou say'st true, it is like wee

not thou horrible afear'd? thou being Heire apparant,
could the World picke thee out three such Enemyes againe,
as that Fiend Dowglas, that Spirit Percy, and that
Deuill Glendower? Art not thou horrible afraid? Doth
not thy blood thrill at it?
 Prin. Not a whit: I lacke some of thy instinct</p><br>

<p id="id11924"> Falst. Well, thou wilt be horrible chidde to morrow,
when thou commest to thy Father: if thou doe loue me,
practise an answere</p><br>

vpon the particulars of my Life<br>

State, this Dagger my Scepter, and this Cushion my<br>

Crowne<br>

<p id="id11927">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Thy State is taken for a Ioyn'd-Stoole, thy Golden<br>

<p id="id11928"> Falst. Well, and the fire of Grace be not quite out of

Harry, I doe not onely maruell where thou spendest thy
time; but also, how thou art accompanied: For though
the Camomile, the more it is troden, the faster it growes;
yet Youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it weares.
Thou art my Sonne: I haue partly thy Mothers Word,
partly my Opinion; but chiefely, a villanous tricke of
thine Eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether Lippe, that
doth warrant me. If then thou be Sonne to mee, heere
lyeth the point: why, being Sonne to me, art thou so
poynted at? Shall the blessed Sonne of Heauen proue a
Micher, and eate Black-berryes? a question not to bee
askt. Shall the Sonne of England proue a Theefe, and
take Purses? a question to be askt. There is a thing,
Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is knowne to
many in our Land, by the Name of Pitch: this Pitch (as
ancient Writers doe report) doth defile; so doth the companie
thou keepest: for Harry, now I doe not speake to
thee in Drinke, but in Teares; not in Pleasure, but in Passion;
not in Words onely, but in Woes also: and yet
there is a vertuous man, whom I haue often noted in thy
companie, but I know not his Name</p><br>

<p id="id11936"> Prin. What manner of man, and it like your Maiestie?
 Falst. A goodly portly man yfaith, and a corpulent,
of a chearefull Looke, a pleasing Eye, and a most noble
Carriage, and as I thinke, his age some fiftie, or (byrlady)
inclining to threescore; and now I remember mee, his
Name is Falstaffe: if that man should be lewdly giuen,
hee deceiues mee; for Harry, I see Vertue in his Lookes.
If then the Tree may be knowne by the Fruit, as the Fruit
by the Tree, then peremptorily I speake it, there is Vertue
in that Falstaffe: him keepe with, the rest banish. And
tell mee now, thou naughtie Varlet, tell mee, where hast
thou beene this moneth?
 Prin. Do'st thou speake like a King? doe thou stand
for mee, and Ile play my Father</p><br>

<p id="id11937"> Falst. Depose me: if thou do'st it halfe so grauely, so
maiestically, both in word and matter, hang me vp by the
heeles for a Rabbet-sucker, or a Poulters Hare</p><br>

<p id="id11938"> Prin. Well, heere I am set</p><br>

<p id="id11939"> Falst. And heere I stand: iudge my Masters</p><br>

<p id="id11940">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Now Harry, whence come you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. My Noble Lord, from East-cheape<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11941"> Prin. The complaints I heare of thee, are grieuous</p><br>

<p id="id11942" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Falst. Yfaith, my Lord, they are false: Nay, Ile tickle
ye for a young Prince</p><br>

<p id="id11943"> Prin. Swearest thou, vngracious Boy? henceforth
ne're looke on me: thou art violently carryed away from
Grace: there is a Deuill haunts thee, in the likenesse of a
fat old Man; a Tunne of Man is thy Companion: Why
do'st thou conuerse with that Trunke of Humors, that
Boulting-Hutch of Beastlinesse, that swolne Parcell of
Dropsies, that huge Bombard of Sacke, that stuft Cloakebagge
of Guts, that rosted Manning Tree Oxe with the
Pudding in his Belly, that reuerend Vice, that grey iniquitie,
that Father Ruffian, that Vanitie in yeeres? wherein
is he good, but to taste Sacke, and drinke it? wherein
neat and cleanly, but to carue a Capon, and eat it? wherein
Cunning, but in Craft? wherein Craftie, but in Villanie?
wherein Villanous, but in all things? wherein worthy,
but in nothing?
 Falst. I would your Grace would take me with you:
whom meanes your Grace?
 Prince. That villanous abhominable mis-leader of
Youth, Falstaffe, that old white-bearded Sathan</p><br>

<p id="id11945"> Prince. I know thou do'st</p><br>

<p id="id11946"> Falst. But to say, I know more harme in him then in
my selfe, were to say more then I know. That hee is olde
(the more the pittie) his white hayres doe witnesse it:
but that hee is (sauing your reuerence) a Whore-master,
that I vtterly deny. If Sacke and Sugar bee a fault,
Heauen helpe the Wicked: if to be olde and merry, be a
sinne, then many an olde Hoste that I know, is damn'd:
if to be fat, be to be hated, then Pharaohs leane Kine are
to be loued. No, my good Lord, banish Peto, banish
Bardolph, banish Poines: but for sweete Iacke Falstaffe,
kinde Iacke Falstaffe, true Iacke Falstaffe, valiant Iacke Falstaffe,
and therefore more valiant, being as hee is olde Iack

monstrous Watch, is at the doore<br>

<p id="id11951">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Heigh, heigh, the Deuill rides vpon a Fiddlesticke:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostesse. The Sherife and all the Watch are at the<br>

doore: they are come to search the House, shall I let<br>

<p id="id11959"> Car. As fat as Butter</p><br>

And Sherife, I will engage my word to thee,<br>

That I will by to morrow Dinner time,<br>

Send him to answere thee, or any man,<br>

For any thing he shall be charg'd withall:<br>

And so let me entreat you, leaue the house<br>

To see the Heauens on fire,<br>

Diseased Nature oftentimes breakes forth<br>

In strange eruptions; and the teeming Earth<br>

To tell you once againe, that at my Birth<br>

The front of Heauen was full of fierie shapes,<br>

The Goates ranne from the Mountaines, and the Heards<br>

Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields:<br>

These signes haue markt me extraordinarie,<br>

And all the courses of my Life doe shew,<br>

Where is the Liuing, clipt in with the Sea,<br>

That chides the Bankes of England, Scotland, and Wales,<br>

Which calls me Pupill, or hath read to me?<br>

And bring him out, that is but Womans Sonne,<br>

<p id="id11989"> Mort. Peace cousin Percy, you will make him mad</p><br>

<p id="id11990"> Glend. I can call Spirits from the vastie Deepe</p><br>

<p id="id11991">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Why so can I, or so can any man:<br>

But will they come, when you doe call for them?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Why, I can teach thee, Cousin, to command the<br>

Deuill<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11992">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. And I can teach thee, Cousin, to shame the Deuil,<br>

By telling truth. Tell truth, and shame the Deuill.<br>

If thou haue power to rayse him, bring him hither,<br>

And Ile be sworne, I haue power to shame him hence.<br>

Oh, while you liue, tell truth, and shame the Deuill<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11993">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. Come, come, no more of this vnprofitable<br>

Chat<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11994">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Three times hath Henry Bullingbrooke made head<br>

Against my Power: thrice from the Banks of Wye,<br>

And sandy-bottom'd Seuerne, haue I hent him<br>

Bootlesse home, and Weather-beaten backe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11995">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Home without Bootes,<br>

And in foule Weather too,<br>

How scapes he Agues in the Deuils name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Come, heere's the Mappe:<br>

Shall wee diuide our Right,<br>

According to our three-fold order ta'ne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. The Arch-Deacon hath diuided it<br>

Into three Limits, very equally:<br>

England, from Trent, and Seuerne. hitherto,<br>

By South and East, is to my part assign'd:<br>

All Westward, Wales, beyond the Seuerne shore,<br>

And all the fertile Land within that bound,<br>

To Owen Glendower: And deare Couze, to you<br>

The remnant Northward, lying off from Trent.<br>

And our Indentures Tripartite are drawne:<br>

Which being sealed enterchangeably,<br>

(A Businesse that this Night may execute)<br>

To morrow, Cousin Percy, you and I,<br>

And my good Lord of Worcester, will set forth,<br>

To meete your Father, and the Scottish Power,<br>

As is appointed vs at Shrewsbury.<br>

My Father Glendower is not readie yet,<br>

Nor shall wee neede his helpe these foureteene dayes:<br>

Within that space, you may haue drawne together<br>

Your Tenants, Friends, and neighbouring Gentlemen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11996">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. A shorter time shall send me to you, Lords:<br>

And in my Conduct shall your Ladies come,<br>

From whom you now must steale, and take no leaue,<br>

For there will be a World of Water shed,<br>

Vpon the parting of your Wiues and you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11997">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Me thinks my Moity, North from Burton here,<br>

In quantitie equals not one of yours:<br>

See, how this Riuer comes me cranking in,<br>

And cuts me from the best of all my Land,<br>

A huge halfe Moone, a monstrous Cantle out.<br>

Ile haue the Currant in this place damn'd vp,<br>

And here the smug and Siluer Trent shall runne,<br>

In a new Channell, faire and euenly:<br>

It shall not winde with such a deepe indent,<br>

To rob me of so rich a Bottome here<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id11998"> Glend. Not winde? it shall, it must, you see it doth</p><br>

<p id="id11999">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. Yea, but marke how he beares his course,<br>

And runnes me vp, with like aduantage on the other side,<br>

Gelding the opposed Continent as much,<br>

As on the other side it takes from you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worc. Yea, but a little Charge will trench him here,<br>

And on this North side winne this Cape of Land,<br>

And then he runnes straight and euen<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12001"> Hotsp. Ile haue it so, a little Charge will doe it</p><br>

<p id="id12002"> Glend. Ile not haue it alter'd</p><br>

<p id="id12003">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Will not you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. No, nor you shall not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12004">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Who shall say me nay?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Why, that will I<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12005">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. let me not vnderstand you then, speake it in<br>

Welsh<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12006">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. I can speake English, Lord, as well as you:<br>

For I was trayn'd vp in the English Court;<br>

Where, being but young, I framed to the Harpe<br>

Many an English Dittie, louely well,<br>

And gaue the Tongue a helpefull Ornament;<br>

A Vertue that was neuer seene in you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12007">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart,<br>

I had rather be a Kitten, and cry mew,<br>

Then one of these same Meeter Ballad-mongers:<br>

I had rather heare a Brazen Candlestick turn'd,<br>

Or a dry Wheele grate on the Axle-tree,<br>

And that would set my teeth nothing an edge,<br>

Nothing so much, as mincing Poetrie;<br>

'Tis like the forc't gate of a shuffling Nagge<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12008"> Glend. Come, you shall haue Trent turn'd</p><br>

<p id="id12009">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. I doe not care: Ile giue thrice so much Land<br>

To any well-deseruing friend;<br>

But in the way of Bargaine, marke ye me,<br>

Ile cauill on the ninth part of a hayre.<br>

Are the Indentures drawne? shall we be gone?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. The Moone shines faire,<br>

You may away by Night:<br>

Ile haste the Writer; and withall,<br>

Breake with your Wiues, of your departure hence:<br>

I am afraid my Daughter will runne madde,<br>

So much she doteth on her Mortimer.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12010"> Mort. Fie, Cousin Percy, how you crosse my Father</p><br>

<p id="id12011">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. I cannot chuse: sometime he angers me,<br>

With telling me of the Moldwarpe and the Ant,<br>

Of the Dreamer Merlin, and his Prophecies;<br>

And of a Dragon, and a finne-lesse Fish,<br>

A clip-wing'd Griffin, and a moulten Rauen,<br>

A couching Lyon, and a ramping Cat,<br>

And such a deale of skimble-skamble Stuffe,<br>

As puts me from my Faith. I tell you what,<br>

He held me last Night, at least, nine howres,<br>

In reckning vp the seuerall Deuils Names,<br>

That were his Lacqueyes:<br>

I cry'd hum, and well, goe too,<br>

But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious<br>

As a tyred Horse, a rayling Wife,<br>

Worse then a smoakie House. I had rather liue<br>

With Cheese and Garlick in a Windmill farre,<br>

Then feede on Cates, and haue him talke to me,<br>

In any Summer-House in Christendome<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12012">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. In faith he was a worthy Gentleman,<br>

Exceeding well read, and profited,<br>

In strange Concealements:<br>

Valiant as a Lyon, and wondrous affable,<br>

And as Bountifull, as Mynes of India.<br>

Shall I tell you, Cousin,<br>

He holds your temper in a high respect,<br>

And curbes himselfe, euen of his naturall scope,<br>

When you doe crosse his humor: 'faith he does.<br>

I warrant you, that man is not aliue,<br>

Might so haue tempted him, as you haue done,<br>

Without the taste of danger, and reproofe:<br>

But doe not vse it oft, let me entreat you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12013">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worc. In faith, my Lord, you are too wilfull blame,<br>

And since your comming hither, haue done enough,<br>

To put him quite besides his patience.<br>

You must needes learne, Lord, to amend this fault:<br>

Though sometimes it shew Greatnesse, Courage, Blood,<br>

And that's the dearest grace it renders you;<br>

Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh Rage,<br>

Defect of Manners, want of Gouernment,<br>

Pride, Haughtinesse, Opinion, and Disdaine:<br>

The least of which, haunting a Nobleman,<br>

Loseth mens hearts, and leaues behinde a stayne<br>

Vpon the beautie of all parts besides,<br>

Beguiling them of commendation<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12014">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Well, I am school'd:<br>

Good-manners be your speede;<br>

Heere come your Wiues, and let vs take our leaue.<br>

Enter Glendower, with the Ladies.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12015">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. This is the deadly spight, that angers me,<br>

My Wife can speake no English, I no Welsh<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12016">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. My Daughter weepes, shee'le not part with you,<br>

Shee'le be a Souldier too, shee'le to the Warres<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12017">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. Good Father tell her, that she and my Aunt Percy<br>

Shall follow in your Conduct speedily.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12018">Glendower speakes to her in Welsh, and she answeres him in the
same.</p><br>

<p id="id12019">&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Shee is desperate heere:<br>

A peeuish selfe-will'd Harlotry,<br>

One that no perswasion can doe good vpon.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12020">The Lady speakes in Welsh.</p><br>

<p id="id12021">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. I vnderstand thy Lookes: that pretty Welsh<br>

Which thou powr'st down from these swelling Heauens,<br>

I am too perfect in: and but for shame,<br>

In such a parley should I answere thee.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12022">The Lady againe in welsh.</p><br>

<p id="id12023">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. I vnderstand thy Kisses, and thou mine,<br>

And that's a feeling disputation:<br>

But I will neuer be a Truant, Loue,<br>

Till I haue learn'd thy Language: for thy tongue<br>

Makes Welsh as sweet as Ditties highly penn'd,<br>

Sung by a faire Queene in a Summers Bowre,<br>

With rauishing Diuision to her Lute<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12024"> Glend. Nay, if thou melt, then will she runne madde.</p><br>

<p id="id12025">The Lady speakes againe in Welsh.</p><br>

<p id="id12026"> Mort. O, I am Ignorance it selfe in this</p><br>

<p id="id12027">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. She bids you,<br>

On the wanton Rushes lay you downe,<br>

And rest your gentle Head vpon her Lappe,<br>

And she will sing the Song that pleaseth you,<br>

And on your Eye-lids Crowne the God of Sleepe,<br>

Charming your blood with pleasing heauinesse;<br>

Making such difference betwixt Wake and Sleepe,<br>

As is the difference betwixt Day and Night,<br>

The houre before the Heauenly Harneis'd Teeme<br>

Begins his Golden Progresse in the East<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12028">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort. With all my heart Ile sit, and heare her sing:<br>

By that time will our Booke, I thinke, be drawne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12029">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Doe so:<br>

And those Musitians that shall play to you,<br>

Hang in the Ayre a thousand Leagues from thence;<br>

And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12030">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Come Kate, thou art perfect in lying downe:<br>

Come, quicke, quicke, that I may lay my Head in thy<br>

Lappe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12031"> Lady. Goe, ye giddy-Goose.</p><br>

<p id="id12032">The Musicke playes.</p><br>

<p id="id12033">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Now I perceiue the Deuill vnderstands Welsh,<br>

And 'tis no maruell he is so humorous:<br>

Byrlady hee's a good Musitian<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12034">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Then would you be nothing but Musicall,<br>

For you are altogether gouerned by humors:<br>

Lye still ye Theefe, and heare the Lady sing in Welsh<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12035">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. I had rather heare (Lady) my Brach howle in<br>

Irish<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12036">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Would'st haue thy Head broken?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. No<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12037"> Lady. Then be still</p><br>

<p id="id12038"> Hotsp. Neyther, 'tis a Womans fault</p><br>

<p id="id12039"> Lady. Now God helpe thee</p><br>

<p id="id12040"> Hotsp. To the Welsh Ladies Bed</p><br>

<p id="id12041">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. What's that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Peace, shee sings.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12042">Heere the Lady sings a Welsh Song.</p><br>

<p id="id12043"> Hotsp. Come, Ile haue your Song too</p><br>

<p id="id12044"> Lady. Not mine, in good sooth</p><br>

<p id="id12045">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Not yours, in good sooth?<br>

You sweare like a Comfit-makers Wife:<br>

Not you, in good sooth; and, as true as I liue;<br>

And, as God shall mend me; and, as sure as day:<br>

And giuest such Sarcenet suretie for thy Oathes,<br>

As if thou neuer walk'st further then Finsbury.<br>

Sweare me, Kate, like a Lady, as thou art,<br>

A good mouth-filling Oath: and leaue in sooth,<br>

And such protest of Pepper Ginger-bread,<br>

To Veluet-Guards, and Sunday-Citizens.<br>

Come, sing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12046"> Lady. I will not sing</p><br>

<p id="id12047"> Hotsp. 'Tis the next way to turne Taylor, or be Redbrest
teacher: and the Indentures be drawne, Ile away
within these two howres: and so come in, when yee
will.
Enter.</p><br>

<p id="id12048">&nbsp;&nbsp;Glend. Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow,<br>

As hot Lord Percy is on fire to goe.<br>

By this our Booke is drawne: wee'le but seale,<br>

And then to Horse immediately<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12049"> Mort. With all my heart.</p><br>

<p id="id12050">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id12051" style="margin-top: 2em">Scaena Secunda.</p><br>

<p id="id12052">Enter the King, Prince of Wales, and others.</p><br>

<p id="id12053">&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Lords, giue vs leaue:<br>

The Prince of Wales, and I,<br>

Must haue some priuate conference:<br>

But be neere at hand,<br>

For wee shall presently haue neede of you.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12054">Exeunt. Lords.</p><br>

<p id="id12055">I know not whether Heauen will haue it so,<br>

For some displeasing seruice I haue done;<br>

That in his secret Doome, out of my Blood,<br>

Hee'le breede Reuengement, and a Scourge for me:<br>

But thou do'st in thy passages of Life,<br>

Make me beleeue, that thou art onely mark'd<br>

For the hot vengeance, and the Rod of heauen<br>

To punish my Mistreadings. Tell me else,<br>

Could such inordinate and low desires,<br>

Such poore, such bare, such lewd, such meane attempts,<br>

Such barren pleasures, rude societie,<br>

As thou art matcht withall, and grafted too,<br>

Accompanie the greatnesse of thy blood,<br>

And hold their leuell with thy Princely heart?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. So please your Maiesty, I would I could<br>

Quit all offences with as cleare excuse,<br>

As well as I am doubtlesse I can purge<br>

My selfe of many I am charg'd withall:<br>

Yet such extenuation let me begge,<br>

As in reproofe of many Tales deuis'd,<br>

Which oft the Eare of Greatnesse needes must heare,<br>

By smiling Pick-thankes, and base Newes-mongers;<br>

I may for some things true, wherein my youth<br>

Hath faultie wandred, and irregular,<br>

Finde pardon on my true submission<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12056">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Heauen pardon thee:<br>

Yet let me wonder, Harry,<br>

At thy affections, which doe hold a Wing<br>

Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.<br>

Thy place in Councell thou hast rudely lost,<br>

Which by thy younger Brother is supply'de;<br>

And art almost an alien to the hearts<br>

Of all the Court and Princes of my blood.<br>

The hope and expectation of thy time<br>

Is ruin'd, and the Soule of euery man<br>

Prophetically doe fore-thinke thy fall.<br>

Had I so lauish of my presence beene,<br>

So common hackney'd in the eyes of men,<br>

So stale and cheape to vulgar Company;<br>

Opinion, that did helpe me to the Crowne,<br>

Had still kept loyall to possession,<br>

And left me in reputelesse banishment,<br>

A fellow of no marke, nor likelyhood.<br>

By being seldome seene, I could not stirre,<br>

But like a Comet, I was wondred at,<br>

That men would tell their Children, This is hee:<br>

Others would say; Where, Which is Bullingbrooke.<br>

And then I stole all Courtesie from Heauen,<br>

And drest my selfe in such Humilitie,<br>

That I did plucke Allegeance from mens hearts,<br>

Lowd Showts and Salutations from their mouthes,<br>

Euen in the presence of the Crowned King.<br>

Thus I did keepe my Person fresh and new,<br>

My Presence like a Robe Pontificall,<br>

Ne're seene, but wondred at: and so my State,<br>

Seldome but sumptuous, shewed like a Feast,<br>

And wonne by rarenesse such Solemnitie.<br>

The skipping King hee ambled vp and downe,<br>

With shallow Iesters, and rash Bauin Wits,<br>

Soone kindled, and soone burnt, carded his state,<br>

Mingled his Royaltie with Carping Fooles,<br>

Had his great Name prophaned with their Scornes,<br>

And gaue his Countenance, against his Name,<br>

To laugh at gybing Boyes, and stand the push<br>

Of euery Beardlesse vaine Comparatiue;<br>

Grew a Companion to the common Streetes,<br>

Enfeoff'd himselfe to Popularitie:<br>

That being dayly swallowed by mens Eyes,<br>

They surfeted with Honey, and began to loathe<br>

The taste of Sweetnesse, whereof a little<br>

More then a little, is by much too much.<br>

So when he had occasion to be seene,<br>

He was but as the Cuckow is in Iune,<br>

Heard, not regarded: seene but with such Eyes,<br>

As sicke and blunted with Communitie,<br>

Affoord no extraordinarie Gaze,<br>

Such as is bent on Sunne-like Maiestie,<br>

When it shines seldome in admiring Eyes:<br>

But rather drowz'd, and hung their eye-lids downe,<br>

Slept in his Face, and rendred such aspect<br>

As Cloudie men vse to doe to their aduersaries,<br>

Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.<br>

And in that very Line, Harry, standest thou:<br>

For thou hast lost thy Princely Priuiledge,<br>

With vile participation. Not an Eye<br>

But is awearie of thy common sight,<br>

Saue mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more:<br>

Which now doth that I would not haue it doe,<br>

Make blinde it selfe with foolish tendernesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12057">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious Lord,<br>

Be more my selfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12058">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. For all the World,<br>

As thou art to this houre, was Richard then,<br>

When I from France set foot at Rauenspurgh;<br>

And euen as I was then, is Percy now:<br>

Now by my Scepter, and my Soule to boot,<br>

He hath more worthy interest to the State<br>

Then thou, the shadow of Succession;<br>

For of no Right, nor colour like to Right.<br>

He doth fill fields with Harneis in the Realme,<br>

Turnes head against the Lyons armed Iawes;<br>

And being no more in debt to yeeres, then thou,<br>

Leades ancient Lords, and reuerent Bishops on<br>

To bloody Battailes, and to brusing Armes.<br>

What neuer-dying Honor hath he got,<br>

Against renowned Dowglas? whose high Deedes,<br>

Whose hot Incursions, and great Name in Armes,<br>

Holds from all Souldiers chiefe Maioritie,<br>

And Militarie Title Capitall.<br>

Through all the Kingdomes that acknowledge Christ,<br>

Thrice hath the Hotspur Mars, in swathing Clothes,<br>

This Infant Warrior, in his Enterprises,<br>

Discomfited great Dowglas, ta'ne him once,<br>

Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,<br>

To fill the mouth of deepe Defiance vp,<br>

And shake the peace and safetie of our Throne.<br>

And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,<br>

The Arch-bishops Grace of Yorke, Dowglas, Mortimer,<br>

Capitulate against vs, and are vp.<br>

But wherefore doe I tell these Newes to thee?<br>

Why, Harry, doe I tell thee of my Foes,<br>

Which art my neer'st and dearest Enemie?<br>

Thou, that art like enough, through vassall Feare,<br>

Base Inclination, and the start of Spleene,<br>

To fight against me vnder Percies pay,<br>

To dogge his heeles, and curtsie at his frownes,<br>

To shew how much thou art degenerate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12059">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Doe not thinke so, you shall not finde it so:<br>

And Heauen forgiue them, that so much haue sway'd<br>

Your Maiesties good thoughts away from me:<br>

I will redeeme all this on Percies head,<br>

And in the closing of some glorious day,<br>

Be bold to tell you, that I am your Sonne,<br>

When I will weare a Garment all of Blood,<br>

And staine my fauours in a bloody Maske:<br>

Which washt away, shall scowre my shame with it.<br>

And that shall be the day, when ere it lights,<br>

That this same Child of Honor and Renowne.<br>

This gallant Hotspur, this all-praysed Knight.<br>

And your vnthought-of Harry chance to meet:<br>

For euery Honor sitting on his Helme,<br>

Would they were multitudes, and on my head<br>

My shames redoubled. For the time will come,<br>

That I shall make this Northerne Youth exchange<br>

His glorious Deedes for my Indignities:<br>

Percy is but my Factor, good my Lord,<br>

To engrosse vp glorious Deedes on my behalfe:<br>

And I will call him to so strict account,<br>

That he shall render euery Glory vp,<br>

Yea, euen the sleightest worship of his time,<br>

Or I will teare the Reckoning from his Heart.<br>

This, in the Name of Heauen, I promise here:<br>

The which, if I performe, and doe suruiue,<br>

I doe beseech your Maiestie, may salue<br>

The long-growne Wounds of my intemperature:<br>

If not, the end of Life cancells all Bands,<br>

And I will dye a hundred thousand Deaths,<br>

Ere breake the smallest parcell of this Vow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12060">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. A hundred thousand Rebels dye in this:<br>

Thou shalt haue Charge, and soueraigne trust herein.<br>

Enter Blunt.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12061">How now good Blunt? thy Lookes are full of speed</p><br>

<p id="id12062">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunt. So hath the Businesse that I come to speake of.<br>

Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word,<br>

That Dowglas and the English Rebels met<br>

The eleuenth of this moneth, at Shrewsbury:<br>

A mightie and a fearefull Head they are,<br>

(If Promises be kept on euery hand)<br>

As euer offered foule play in a State<br>

With him my sonne, Lord Iohn of Lancaster,<br>

For this aduertisement is fiue dayes old.<br>

On Wednesday next, Harry thou shalt set forward:<br>

On thursday, wee our selues will march.<br>

Our meeting is Bridgenorth: and Harry, you shall march<br>

Through Glocestershire: by which account,<br>

Our Businesse valued some twelue dayes hence,<br>

Our generall Forces at Bridgenorth shall meete.<br>

Our Hands are full of Businesse: let's away,<br>

Aduantage feedes him fat, while men delay.<br>

Ile repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking:
I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall haue no

in-side of a Church is made of, I am a Pepper-Corne, a
Brewers Horse, the in-side of a Church. Company, villanous
Company hath beene the spoyle of me</p><br>

<p id="id12068" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bard. Sir Iohn, you are so fretfull, you cannot liue
long</p><br>

<p id="id12069"> Falst. Why there is it: Come, sing me a bawdy Song,
make me merry; I was as vertuously giuen, as a Gentleman
need to be; vertuous enough, swore little, dic'd not
aboue seuen times a weeke, went to a Bawdy-house not
aboue once in a quarter of an houre, payd Money that I
borrowed, three or foure times; liued well, and in good
compasse: and now I liue out of all order, out of compasse</p><br>

<p id="id12070"> Bard. Why, you are so fat, Sir Iohn, that you must
needes bee out of of all compasse; out all reasonable
compasse, Sir Iohn</p><br>

<p id="id12071">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Doe thou amend thy Face, and Ile amend thy<br>

Life: Thou art our Admirall, thou bearest the Lanterne<br>

in the Poope, but 'tis in the Nose of thee; thou art the<br>

Knight of the burning Lampe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12072"> Bard. Why, Sir Iohn, my Face does you no harme</p><br>

<p id="id12073"> Falst. No, Ile be sworne: I make as good vse of it, as
many a man doth of a Deaths-Head, or a Memento Mori.
I neuer see thy Face, but I thinke vpon Hell fire, and Diues
that liued in Purple; for there he is in his Robes burning,
burning. If thou wert any way giuen to vertue, I would
sweare by thy Face; my Oath should bee, By this Fire:
But thou art altogether giuen ouer; and wert indeede,
but for the Light in thy Face, the Sunne of vtter Darkenesse.
When thou ran'st vp Gads-Hill in the Night, to
catch my Horse, if I did not thinke that thou hadst beene
an Ignis fatuus, or a Ball of Wild-fire, there's no Purchase
in Money. O, thou art a perpetuall Triumph, an euerlasting
Bone-fire-Light: thou hast saued me a thousand
Markes in Linkes and Torches, walking with thee in the
Night betwixt Tauerne and Tauerne: But the Sack that
thou hast drunke me, would haue bought me Lights as
good cheape, as the dearest Chandlers in Europe. I haue
maintain'd that Salamander of yours with fire, any time
this two and thirtie yeeres, Heauen reward me for it</p><br>

<p id="id12074"> Bard. I would my Face were in your Belly</p><br>

<p id="id12075">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. So should I be sure to be heart-burn'd.<br>

Enter Hostesse.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12076">How now, Dame Partlet the Hen, haue you enquir'd yet
who pick'd my Pocket?
 Hostesse. Why Sir Iohn, what doe you thinke, Sir Iohn?
doe you thinke I keepe Theeues in my House? I haue
search'd, I haue enquired, so haz my Husband, Man by
Man, Boy by Boy, Seruant by Seruant: the tight of a
hayre was neuer lost in my house before</p><br>

<p id="id12077"> Falst. Ye lye Hostesse: Bardolph was shau'd, and lost
many a hayre; and Ile be sworne my Pocket was pick'd:
goe to, you are a Woman, goe</p><br>

<p id="id12078" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Hostesse. Who I? I defie thee: I was neuer call'd so
in mine owne house before</p><br>

<p id="id12079"> Falst. Goe to, I know you well enough</p><br>

<p id="id12080"> Hostesse. No, sir Iohn, you doe not know me, Sir Iohn:
I know you, Sir Iohn: you owe me Money, Sir Iohn, and
now you picke a quarrell, to beguile me of it: I bought
you a dozen of Shirts to your Backe</p><br>

<p id="id12081"> Falst. Doulas, filthy Doulas: I haue giuen them
away to Bakers Wiues, and they haue made Boulters of
them</p><br>

<p id="id12082"> Hostesse. Now as I am a true Woman, Holland of eight
shillings an Ell: You owe Money here besides, Sir Iohn,
for your Dyet, and by-Drinkings, and Money lent you,
foure and twentie pounds</p><br>

<p id="id12083"> Falst. Hee had his part of it, let him pay</p><br>

<p id="id12084"> Hostesse. Hee? alas hee is poore, hee hath nothing</p><br>

<p id="id12085"> Falst. How? Poore? Looke vpon his Face: What call
you Rich? Let them coyne his Nose, let them coyne his
Cheekes, Ile not pay a Denier. What, will you make a
Younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease in mine Inne,
but I shall haue my Pocket pick'd? I haue lost a Seale-Ring
of my Grand-fathers, worth fortie marke</p><br>

<p id="id12086">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostesse. I haue heard the Prince tell him, I know not<br>

how oft, that that Ring was Copper<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12087">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. How? the Prince is a Iacke, a Sneake-Cuppe:<br>

and if hee were heere, I would cudgell him like a Dogge,<br>

if hee would say so.<br>

Enter the Prince marching, and Falstaffe meets him, playing on his<br>

Trunchion like a Fife.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12088">&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. How now Lad? is the Winde in that Doore?<br>

Must we all march?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12089"> Hostesse. My Lord, I pray you heare me</p><br>

<p id="id12090"> Prince. What say'st thou, Mistresse Quickly? How
does thy Husband? I loue him well, hee is an honest
man</p><br>

<p id="id12091"> Hostesse. Good, my Lord, heare mee</p><br>

<p id="id12092"> Falst. Prethee let her alone, and list to mee</p><br>

<p id="id12093">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. What say'st thou, Iacke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. The other Night I fell asleepe heere behind the<br>

Arras, and had my Pocket pickt: this House is turn'd<br>

Bawdy-house, they picke Pockets<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12094">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. What didst thou lose, Iacke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Wilt thou beleeue me, Hal? Three or foure Bonds<br>

of fortie pound apeece, and a Seale-Ring of my Grand-fathers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12095"> Prince. A Trifle, some eight-penny matter</p><br>

<p id="id12096"> Host. So I told him, my Lord; and I said, I heard your
Grace say so: and (my Lord) hee speakes most vilely of
you, like a foule-mouth'd man as hee is, and said, hee
would cudgell you</p><br>

<p id="id12097">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. What hee did not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. There's neyther Faith, Truth, nor Woman-hood<br>

in me else<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12098"> Falst. There's no more faith in thee then a stu'de Prune;
nor no more truth in thee, then in a drawne Fox: and for
Wooman-hood, Maid-marian may be the Deputies wife
of the Ward to thee. Go you nothing: go</p><br>

<p id="id12099">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. Say, what thing? what thing?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. What thing? why a thing to thanke heauen on<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12100"> Host. I am no thing to thanke heauen on, I wold thou
shouldst know it: I am an honest mans wife: and setting
thy Knighthood aside, thou art a knaue to call me so</p><br>

<p id="id12101">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Setting thy woman-hood aside, thou art a beast<br>

to say otherwise<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12102">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. Say, what beast, thou knaue thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. What beast? Why an Otter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12103">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. An Otter, sir Iohn? Why an Otter?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Why? She's neither fish nor flesh; a man knowes<br>

not where to haue her<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12104">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. Thou art vniust man in saying so; thou, or anie<br>

man knowes where to haue me, thou knaue thou<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12105">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Thou say'st true Hostesse, and he slanders thee<br>

most grossely<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12106">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. So he doth you, my Lord, and sayde this other<br>

day, You ought him a thousand pound<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. A thousand pound Hal? A Million. Thy loue is<br>

worth a Million: thou ow'st me thy loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12108">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. Nay my Lord, he call'd you Iacke, and said hee<br>

would cudgell you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12109">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Did I, Bardolph?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar. Indeed Sir Iohn, you said so<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12110"> Fal. Yea, if he said my Ring was Copper</p><br>

<p id="id12111"> Prince. I say 'tis Copper. Dar'st thou bee as good as
thy word now?
 Fal. Why Hal? thou know'st, as thou art but a man, I
dare: but, as thou art a Prince, I feare thee, as I feare the
roaring of the Lyons Whelpe</p><br>

<p id="id12112">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. And why not as the Lyon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. The King himselfe is to bee feared as the Lyon:<br>

Do'st thou thinke Ile feare thee, as I feare thy Father? nay<br>

if I do, let my Girdle breake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12113"> Prin. O, if it should, how would thy guttes fall about
thy knees. But sirra: There's no roome for Faith, Truth,
nor Honesty, in this bosome of thine: it is all fill'd vppe
with Guttes and Midriffe. Charge an honest Woman
with picking thy pocket? Why thou horson impudent
imbost Rascall, if there were any thing in thy Pocket but
Tauerne Recknings, Memorandums of Bawdie-houses,
and one poore peny-worth of Sugar-candie to make thee
long-winded: if thy pocket were enrich'd with anie other
iniuries but these, I am a Villaine: And yet you will
stand to it, you will not Pocket vp wrong. Art thou not
asham'd?
 Fal. Do'st thou heare Hal? Thou know'st in the state
of Innocency, Adam fell: and what should poore Iacke
Falstaffe do, in the dayes of Villany? Thou seest, I haue
more flesh then another man, and therefore more frailty.
You confesse then you pickt my Pocket?
 Prin. It appeares so by the Story</p><br>

<p id="id12114">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Hostesse, I forgiue thee:<br>

Go make ready Breakfast, loue thy Husband,<br>

Looke to thy Seruants, and cherish thy Guests:<br>

Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason:<br>

Thou seest, I am pacified still.<br>

Nay, I prethee be gone.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12115">Exit Hostesse.</p><br>

<p id="id12116">Now Hal, to the newes at Court for the Robbery, Lad?<br>

How is that answered?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. O my sweet Beefe:<br>

I must still be good Angell to thee.<br>

The Monie is paid backe againe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12117">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. O, I do not like that paying backe, 'tis a double<br>

Labour<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12118">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. I am good Friends with my Father, and may do<br>

anything<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12119">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou do'st,<br>

and do it with vnwash'd hands too<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12120"> Bard. Do my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id12121"> Prin. I haue procured thee Iacke, A Charge of Foot</p><br>

<p id="id12122"> Fal. I would it had beene of Horse. Where shal I finde
one that can steale well? O, for a fine theefe of two and
twentie, or thereabout: I am heynously vnprouided. Wel
God be thanked for these Rebels, they offend none but
the Vertuous. I laud them, I praise them</p><br>

<p id="id12123"> Prin. Bardolph</p><br>

<p id="id12124"> Bar. My Lord</p><br>

<p id="id12125">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. Go beare this Letter to Lord Iohn of Lancaster<br>

To my Brother Iohn. This to my Lord of Westmerland,<br>

Go Peto, to horse: for thou, and I,<br>

Haue thirtie miles to ride yet ere dinner time.<br>

Iacke, meet me tomorrow in the Temple Hall<br>

At two a clocke in the afternoone,<br>

There shalt thou know thy Charge, and there receiue<br>

Money and Order for their Furniture.<br>

The Land is burning, Percie stands on hye,<br>

And either they, or we must lower lye<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12126">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Rare words! braue world.<br>

Hostesse, my breakfast, come:<br>

Oh, I could wish this Tauerne were my drumme.<br>

<p id="id12127">Exeunt. omnes.</p><br>

<p id="id12129">Enter Harrie Hotspurre, Worcester, and Dowglas.</p><br>

<p id="id12130">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. Well said, my Noble Scot, if speaking truth<br>

In this fine Age, were not thought flatterie,<br>

Such attribution should the Dowglas haue,<br>

As not a Souldiour of this seasons stampe,<br>

Should go so generall currant through the world.<br>

By heauen I cannot flatter: I defie<br>

The Tongues of Soothers. But a Brauer place<br>

In my hearts loue, hath no man then your Selfe.<br>

Nay, taske me to my word: approue me Lord<br>

No man so potent breathes vpon the ground,<br>

But I will Beard him.<br>

Enter a Messenger.<br>

I can but thanke you<br>

<p id="id12133"> Mess. These Letters come from your Father</p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mes. He cannot come, my Lord,<br>

He is greeuous sicke<br>

<p id="id12135">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot. How? haz he the leysure to be sicke now,<br>

In such a iustling time? Who leades his power?<br>

Vnder whose Gouernment come they along?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. His Letters beares his minde, not I his minde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12136">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. I prethee tell me, doth he keepe his Bed?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. He did, my Lord, foure dayes ere I set forth:<br>

And at the time of my departure thence,<br>

He was much fear'd by his Physician<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12137">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. I would the state of time had first beene whole,<br>

Ere he by sicknesse had beene visited:<br>

His health was neuer better worth then now<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Sicke now? droope now? this sicknes doth infect<br>

The very Life-blood of our Enterprise,<br>

'Tis catching hither, euen to our Campe.<br>

He writes me here, that inward sicknesse,<br>

And that his friends by deputation<br>

Could not so soone be drawne: nor did he thinke it meet,<br>

To lay so dangerous and deare a trust<br>

On any Soule remou'd, but on his owne.<br>

Yet doth he giue vs bold aduertisement,<br>

That with our small coniunction we should on,<br>

To see how Fortune is dispos'd to vs:<br>

For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,<br>

Because the King is certainely possest<br>

Of all our purposes. What say you to it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. Your Fathers sicknesse is a mayme to vs<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. A perillous Gash, a very Limme lopt off:<br>

And yet, in faith, it is not his present want<br>

Seemes more then we shall finde it.<br>

Were it good, to set the exact wealth of all our states<br>

All at one Cast? To set so rich a mayne<br>

On the nice hazard of one doubtfull houre,<br>

It were not good: for therein should we reade<br>

The very Bottome, and the Soule of Hope,<br>

The very List, the very vtmost Bound<br>

Of all our fortunes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dowg. Faith, and so wee should,<br>

Where now remaines a sweet reuersion.<br>

We may boldly spend, vpon the hope<br>

Of what is to come in:<br>

A comfort of retyrement liues in this<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12141">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. A Randeuous, a Home to flye vnto,<br>

If that the Deuill and Mischance looke bigge<br>

Vpon the Maydenhead of our Affaires<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12142">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor. But yet I would your Father had beene here:<br>

The qualitie and Heire of our Attempt<br>

Brookes no diuision: It will be thought<br>

By some, that know not why he is away,<br>

That wisedome, loyaltie, and meere dislike<br>

Of our proceedings, kept the Earle from hence.<br>

And thinke, how such an apprehension<br>

May turne the tyde of fearefull Faction,<br>

And breede a kinde of question in our cause:<br>

For well you know, wee of the offring side,<br>

Must keepe aloofe from strict arbitrement,<br>

And stop all sight-holes, euery loope, from whence<br>

The eye of reason may prie in vpon vs:<br>

This absence of your Father drawes a Curtaine,<br>

That shewes the ignorant a kinde of feare,<br>

Before not dreamt of<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12143">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. You strayne too farre.<br>

I rather of his absence make this vse:<br>

It lends a Lustre, and more great Opinion,<br>

A larger Dare to your great Enterprize,<br>

Then if the Earle were here: for men must thinke,<br>

If we without his helpe, can make a Head<br>

To push against the Kingdome; with his helpe,<br>

We shall o're-turne it topsie-turuy downe:<br>

Yet all goes well, yet all our ioynts are whole<br>
</p><br>

There is not such a word spoke of in Scotland,<br>

<p id="id12145"> Hotsp. My Cousin Vernon, welcome by my Soule</p><br>

All plum'd like Estridges, that with the Winde<br>

Bayted like Eagles, hauing lately bath'd,<br>

Glittering in Golden Coates, like Images,<br>

As full of spirit as the Moneth of May,<br>

And gorgeous as the Sunne at Mid-summer,<br>

Wanton as youthfull Goates, wilde as young Bulls.<br>

I saw young Harry with his Beuer on,<br>

His Cushes on his thighes, gallantly arm'd,<br>

Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,<br>

And vaulted with such ease into his Seat,<br>

As if an Angell dropt downe from the Clouds,<br>

To turne and winde a fierie Pegasus,<br>

And witch the World with Noble Horsemanship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12149">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. No more, no more,<br>

Worse then the Sunne in March:<br>

This prayse doth nourish Agues: let them come.<br>

They come like Sacrifices in their trimme,<br>

And to the fire-ey'd Maid of smoakie Warre,<br>

All hot, and bleeding, will wee offer them:<br>

The mayled Mars shall on his Altar sit<br>

Vp to the eares in blood. I am on fire,<br>

To heare this rich reprizall is so nigh,<br>

And yet not ours. Come, let me take my Horse,<br>

Who is to beare me like a Thunder-bolt,<br>

Against the bosome of the Prince of Wales.<br>

Harry to Harry, shall not Horse to Horse<br>

none but good House-holders, Yeomens Sonnes: enquire
me out contracted Batchelers, such as had beene ask'd
twice on the Banes: such a Commoditie of warme slaues,
as had as lieue heare the Deuill, as a Drumme; such as
feare the report of a Caliuer, worse then a struck-Foole,
or a hurt wilde-Ducke. I prest me none but such Tostes
and Butter, with Hearts in their Bellyes no bigger then
Pinnes heads, and they haue bought out their seruices:
And now, my whole Charge consists of Ancients, Corporals,
Lieutenants, Gentlemen of Companies, Slaues as
ragged a Lazarus in the painted Cloth, where the Gluttons
Dogges licked his Sores; and such, as indeed were
neuer Souldiers, but dis-carded vniust Seruingmen, younger
Sonnes to younger Brothers, reuolted Tapsters and
Ostlers, Trade-falne, the Cankers of a calme World, and
long Peace, tenne times more dis-honorable ragged,
then an old-fac'd Ancient; and such haue I to fill vp the
roomes of them that haue bought out their seruices: that
you would thinke, that I had a hundred and fiftie totter'd
Prodigalls, lately come from Swine-keeping, from eating
Draffe and Huskes. A mad fellow met me on the way,
and told me, I had vnloaded all the Gibbets, and prest the
dead bodyes. No eye hath seene such skar-Crowes: Ile
not march through Couentry with them, that's flat. Nay,
and the Villaines march wide betwixt the Legges, as if
they had Gyues on; for indeede, I had the most of them
out of Prison. There's not a Shirt and a halfe in all my
Company: and the halfe Shirt is two Napkins tackt together,
and throwne ouer the shoulders like a Heralds
Coat, without sleeues: and the Shirt, to say the truth,
stolne from my Host of S[aint]. Albones, or the Red-Nose
Inne-keeper of Dauintry. But that's all one, they'le finde
Linnen enough on euery Hedge.
Enter the Prince, and the Lord of Westmerland.</p><br>

<p id="id12165"> Prince. How now blowne Iack? how now Quilt?
 Falst. What Hal? How now mad Wag, what a Deuill
do'st thou in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmerland,
I cry you mercy, I thought your Honour had already
beene at Shrewsbury</p><br>

<p id="id12166"> West. 'Faith, Sir Iohn, 'tis more then time that I were
there, and you too: but my Powers are there alreadie.
The King, I can tell you, lookes for vs all: we must away
all to Night</p><br>

<p id="id12167">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Tut, neuer feare me, I am as vigilant as a Cat, to<br>

steale Creame<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12168">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. I thinke to steale Creame indeed, for thy theft<br>

hath alreadie made thee Butter: but tell me, Iack, whose<br>

fellowes are these that come after?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Mine, Hal, mine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12169"> Prince. I did neuer see such pittifull Rascals</p><br>

<p id="id12170"> Falst. Tut, tut, good enough to tosse: foode for Powder,
foode for Powder: they'le fill a Pit, as well as better:
tush man, mortall men, mortall men</p><br>

<p id="id12171" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Westm. I, but Sir Iohn, me thinkes they are exceeding
poore and bare, too beggarly</p><br>

<p id="id12172"> Falst. Faith, for their pouertie, I know not where they
had that; and for their barenesse, I am sure they neuer
learn'd that of me</p><br>

<p id="id12173"> Prince. No, Ile be sworne, vnlesse you call three fingers
on the Ribbes bare. But sirra, make haste, Percy is already
in the field</p><br>

<p id="id12174">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. What, is the King encamp'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Westm. Hee is, Sir Iohn, I feare wee shall stay too<br>

long<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12175">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Well, to the latter end of a Fray, and the beginning<br>

of a Feast, fits a dull fighter, and a keene Guest.<br>

I wonder much, being me[n] of such great leading as you are<br>

That you fore-see not what impediments<br>

Drag backe our expedition: certaine Horse<br>

Of my Cousin Vernons are not yet come vp,<br>

Your Vnckle Worcesters Horse came but to day,<br>

And now their pride and mettall is asleepe,<br>

Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,<br>

That not a Horse is halfe the halfe of himselfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12193">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. So are the Horses of the Enemie<br>

In generall iourney bated, and brought low:<br>

The better part of ours are full of rest<br>

If you vouchsafe me hearing, and respect<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12197">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt:<br>

And would to God you were of our determination.<br>

Some of vs loue you well: and euen those some<br>

Enuie your great deseruings, and good name,<br>

Because you are not of our qualitie,<br>

But stand against vs like an Enemie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12198">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunt. And Heauen defend, but still I should stand so,<br>

So long as out of Limit, and true Rule,<br>

You stand against anoynted Maiestie.<br>

But to my Charge.<br>

The King hath sent to know<br>

The nature of your Griefes, and whereupon<br>

You coniure from the Brest of Ciuill Peace,<br>

Such bold Hostilitie, teaching his dutious Land<br>

Audacious Crueltie. If that the King<br>

Haue any way your good Deserts forgot,<br>

Which he confesseth to be manifold,<br>

He bids you name your Griefes, and with all speed<br>

You shall haue your desires, with interest;<br>

And Pardon absolute for your selfe, and these,<br>

Herein mis-led, by your suggestion<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12199">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. The King is kinde:<br>

And well wee know, the King<br>

Knowes at what time to promise, when to pay.<br>

My Father, my Vnckle, and my selfe,<br>

Did giue him that same Royaltie he weares:<br>

And when he was not sixe and twentie strong,<br>

Sicke in the Worlds regard, wretched, and low,<br>

A poore vnminded Out-law, sneaking home,<br>

My Father gaue him welcome to the shore:<br>

And when he heard him sweare, and vow to God,<br>

He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,<br>

To sue his Liuerie, and begge his Peace,<br>

With teares of Innocencie, and tearmes of Zeale;<br>

My Father, in kinde heart and pitty mou'd,<br>

Swore him assistance, and perform'd it too.<br>

Now, when the Lords and Barons of the Realme<br>

Perceiu'd Northumberland did leane to him,<br>

The more and lesse came in with Cap and Knee,<br>

Met him in Boroughs, Cities, Villages,<br>

Attended him on Bridges, stood in Lanes,<br>

Layd Gifts before him, proffer'd him their Oathes,<br>

Gaue him their Heires, as Pages followed him,<br>

Euen at the heeles, in golden multitudes.<br>

He presently, as Greatnesse knowes it selfe,<br>

Step me a little higher then his Vow<br>

Made to my Father, while his blood was poore,<br>

Vpon the naked shore at Rauenspurgh:<br>

And now (forsooth) takes on him to reforme<br>

Some certaine Edicts, and some strait Decrees,<br>

That lay too heauie on the Common-wealth;<br>

Cryes out vpon abuses, seemes to weepe<br>

Ouer his Countries Wrongs: and by this Face,<br>

This seeming Brow of Iustice, did he winne<br>

The hearts of all that hee did angle for.<br>

Proceeded further, cut me off the Heads<br>

Of all the Fauorites, that the absent King<br>

In deputation left behinde him heere,<br>

When hee was personall in the Irish Warre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12200"> Blunt. Tut, I came not to hear this</p><br>

<p id="id12201">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Then to the point.<br>

In short time after, hee depos'd the King.<br>

Soone after that, depriu'd him of his Life:<br>

And in the neck of that, task't the whole State.<br>

To make that worse, suffer'd his Kinsman March,<br>

Who is, if euery Owner were plac'd,<br>

Indeede his King, to be engag'd in Wales,<br>

There, without Ransome, to lye forfeited:<br>

Disgrac'd me in my happie Victories,<br>

Sought to intrap me by intelligence,<br>

Rated my Vnckle from the Councell-Boord,<br>

In rage dismiss'd my Father from the Court,<br>

Broke Oath on Oath, committed Wrong on Wrong,<br>

And in conclusion, droue vs to seeke out<br>

This Head of safetie; and withall, to prie<br>

Into his Title: the which wee finde<br>

Too indirect, for long continuance<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12202">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunt. Shall I returne this answer to the King?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotsp. Not so, Sir Walter.<br>

Wee'le with-draw a while:<br>

Goe to the King, and let there be impawn'd<br>

Some suretie for a safe returne againe,<br>

And in the Morning early shall my Vnckle<br>

Bring him our purpose: and so farewell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12203"> Blunt. I would you would accept of Grace and Loue</p><br>

<p id="id12204"> Hotsp. And't may be, so wee shall</p><br>

<p id="id12205"> Blunt. Pray Heauen you doe.</p><br>

Must bide the touch. For Sir, at Shrewsbury,<br>

As I am truly giuen to vnderstand,<br>

The King, with mightie and quick-raysed Power,<br>

Meetes with Lord Harry: and I feare, Sir Michell,<br>

What with the sicknesse of Northumberland,<br>

Whose Power was in the first proportion;<br>

And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence,<br>

Who with them was rated firmely too,<br>

And comes not in, ouer-rul'd by Prophecies,<br>

I feare the Power of Percy is too weake,<br>

To wage an instant tryall with the King<br>

<p id="id12212">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Mich. Why, my good Lord, you need not feare,<br>

And many moe Corriuals, and deare men<br>

Of estimation, and command in Armes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12216">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir M. Doubt not my Lord, he shall be well oppos'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Arch. I hope no lesse? Yet needfull 'tis to feare,<br>

And to preuent the worst, Sir Michell speed;<br>

For if Lord Percy thriue not, ere the King<br>

Dismisse his power, he meanes to visit vs:<br>

For he hath heard of our Confederacie,<br>

And, 'tis but Wisedome to make strong against him:<br>

Therefore make hast, I must go write againe<br>

Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale<br>

At his distemperature<br>

Fortels a Tempest, and a blust'ring day<br>

And made vs doffe our easie Robes of Peace,<br>

To crush our old limbes in vngentle Steele:<br>

This is not well, my Lord, this is not well.<br>

What say you to it? Will you againe vnknit<br>

This churlish knot of all-abhorred Warre?<br>

And moue in the obedient Orbe againe,<br>

Where you did giue a faire and naturall light,<br>

And be no more an exhall'd Meteor,<br>

A prodigie of Feare, and a Portent<br>

Of Fauour, from my Selfe, and all our House;<br>

And yet I must remember you my Lord,<br>

We were the first, and dearest of your Friends:<br>

For you, my staffe of Office did I breake<br>

In Richards time, and poasted day and night<br>

To meete you on the way, and kisse your hand,<br>

When yet you were in place, and in account<br>

Nothing so strong and fortunate, as I;<br>

It was my Selfe, my Brother, and his Sonne,<br>

That brought you home, and boldly did out-dare<br>

The danger of the time. You swore to vs,<br>

And you did sweare that Oath at Doncaster,<br>

That you did nothing of purpose 'gainst the State,<br>

Nor claime no further, then your new-falne right,<br>

The seate of Gaunt, Dukedome of Lancaster,<br>

To this, we sware our aide: But in short space,<br>

It rain'd downe Fortune showring on your head,<br>

And such a floud of Greatnesse fell on you,<br>

What with our helpe, what with the absent King.<br>

What with the iniuries of wanton time,<br>

The seeming sufferances that you had borne,<br>

And the contrarious Windes that held the King<br>

So long in the vnlucky Irish Warres,<br>

That all in England did repute him dead:<br>

And from this swarme of faire aduantages,<br>

You tooke occasion to be quickly woo'd,<br>

To gripe the generall sway into your hand,<br>

Forgot your Oath to vs at Doncaster,<br>

And being fed by vs, you vs'd vs so,<br>

As that vngentle gull the Cuckowes Bird,<br>

Vseth the Sparrow, did oppresse our Nest<br>

Grew by our Feeding, to so great a builke,<br>

That euen our Loue durst not come neere your sight<br>

For feare of swallowing: But with nimble wing<br>

We were infor'd for safety sake, to flye<br>

Out of your sight, and raise this present Head,<br>

Whereby we stand opposed by such meanes<br>

As you your selfe, haue forg'd against your selfe,<br>

And violation of all faith and troth<br>

Sworne to vs in yonger enterprize<br>

Proclaim'd at Market Crosses, read in Churches,<br>

To face the Garment of Rebellion<br>

With some fine colour, that may please the eye<br>

Of fickle Changelings, and poore Discontents,<br>

Which gape, and rub the Elbow at the newes<br>

Of hurly burly Innouation:<br>

And neuer yet did Insurrection want<br>

Such water-colours, to impaint his cause:<br>

Nor moody Beggars, staruing for a time<br>

Of pell-mell hauocke, and confusion<br>

<p id="id12229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. In both our Armies, there is many a soule<br>

Shall pay full dearely for this encounter,<br>

If once they ioyne in triall. Tell your Nephew,<br>

The Prince of Wales doth ioyne with all the world<br>

In praise of Henry Percie: By my Hopes,<br>

This present enterprize set off his head,<br>

I do not thinke a brauer Gentleman,<br>

More actiue, valiant, or more valiant yong,<br>

More daring, or more bold, is now aliue,<br>

To grace this latter Age with Noble deeds.<br>

For my part, I may speake it to my shame,<br>

I haue a Truant beene to Chiualry,<br>

And so I heare, he doth account me too:<br>

Yet this before my Fathers Maiesty,<br>

I am content that he shall take the oddes<br>

Of his great name and estimation,<br>

And will, to saue the blood on either side,<br>

Try fortune with him, in a Single Fight<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12230">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. And Prince of Wales, so dare we venter thee,<br>

Albeit, considerations infinite<br>

Do make against it: No good Worster, no,<br>

We loue our people well; euen those we loue<br>

That are misled vpon your Cousins part:<br>

And will they take the offer of our Grace:<br>

Both he, and they, and you; yea euery man<br>

Shall be my Friend againe, and Ile be his.<br>

So tell your Cousin, and bring me word,<br>

What he will do. But if he will not yeeld,<br>

Rebuke and dread correction waite on vs,<br>

And they shall do their Office. So bee gone,<br>

We will not now be troubled with reply,<br>

We offer faire, take it aduisedly.<br>

There did he pause. But let me tell the World,<br>

<p id="id12357">Enter Lord Bardolfe, and the Porter.</p><br>

<p id="id12358">&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. Who keepes the Gate heere hoa?<br>

Where is the Earle?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. What shall I say you are?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar. Tell thou the Earle<br>

That the Lord Bardolfe doth attend him heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12359">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por. His Lordship is walk'd forth into the Orchard,<br>

Please it your Honor, knocke but at the Gate,<br>

And he himselfe will answer.<br>

Enter Northumberland.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12360"> L.Bar. Heere comes the Earle</p><br>

<p id="id12361">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. What newes Lord Bardolfe? Eu'ry minute now<br>

Should be the Father of some Stratagem;<br>

The Times are wilde: Contention (like a Horse<br>

Full of high Feeding) madly hath broke loose,<br>

And beares downe all before him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12362">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. Noble Earle,<br>

I bring you certaine newes from Shrewsbury<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12363"> Nor. Good, and heauen will</p><br>

<p id="id12364">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. As good as heart can wish:<br>

The King is almost wounded to the death:<br>

And in the Fortune of my Lord your Sonne,<br>

Prince Harrie slaine out-right: and both the Blunts<br>

Kill'd by the hand of Dowglas. Yong Prince Iohn,<br>

And Westmerland, and Stafford, fled the Field.<br>

And Harrie Monmouth's Brawne (the Hulke Sir Iohn)<br>

Is prisoner to your Sonne. O, such a Day,<br>

(So fought, so follow'd, and so fairely wonne)<br>

Came not, till now, to dignifie the Times<br>

Since C??sars Fortunes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12365">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. How is this deriu'd?<br>

Saw you the Field? Came you from Shrewsbury?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. I spake with one (my L[ord].) that came fro[m] thence,<br>

A Gentleman well bred, and of good name,<br>

That freely render'd me these newes for true<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12366">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Heere comes my Seruant Trauers, whom I sent<br>

On Tuesday last, to listen after Newes.<br>

Enter Trauers.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12367">&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. My Lord, I ouer-rod him on the way,<br>

And he is furnish'd with no certainties,<br>

More then he (haply) may retaile from me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12368">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Now Trauers, what good tidings comes fro[m] you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tra. My Lord, Sir Iohn Vmfreuill turn'd me backe<br>

With ioyfull tydings; and (being better hors'd)<br>

Out-rod me. After him, came spurring head<br>

A Gentleman (almost fore-spent with speed)<br>

That stopp'd by me, to breath his bloodied horse.<br>

He ask'd the way to Chester: And of him<br>

I did demand what Newes from Shrewsbury:<br>

He told me, that Rebellion had ill lucke,<br>

And that yong Harry Percies Spurre was cold.<br>

With that he gaue his able Horse the head,<br>

And bending forwards strooke his able heeles<br>

Against the panting sides of his poore Iade<br>

Vp to the Rowell head, and starting so,<br>

He seem'd in running, to deuoure the way,<br>

Staying no longer question<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12369">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. Ha? Againe:<br>

Said he yong Harrie Percyes Spurre was cold?<br>

(Of Hot-Spurre, cold-Spurre?) that Rebellion,<br>

Had met ill lucke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. My Lord: Ile tell you what,<br>

If my yong Lord your Sonne, haue not the day,<br>

Vpon mine Honor, for a silken point<br>

Ile giue my Barony. Neuer talke of it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12370">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Why should the Gentleman that rode by Trauers<br>

Giue then such instances of Losse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. Who, he?<br>

He was some hielding Fellow, that had stolne<br>

The Horse he rode-on: and vpon my life<br>

Speake at aduenture. Looke, here comes more Newes.<br>

Enter Morton.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12371">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor. Yea, this mans brow, like to a Title-leafe,<br>

Fore-tels the Nature of a Tragicke Volume:<br>

So lookes the Strond, when the Imperious Flood<br>

Hath left a witnest Vsurpation.<br>

Say Morton, did'st thou come from Shrewsbury?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. I ran from Shrewsbury (my Noble Lord)<br>

Where hatefull death put on his vgliest Maske<br>

To fright our party<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12372">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. How doth my Sonne, and Brother?<br>

Thou trembl'st; and the whitenesse in thy Cheeke<br>

Is apter then thy Tongue, to tell thy Errand.<br>

Euen such a man, so faint, so spiritlesse,<br>

So dull, so dead in looke, so woe-be-gone,<br>

Drew Priams Curtaine, in the dead of night,<br>

And would haue told him, Halfe his Troy was burn'd.<br>

But Priam found the Fire, ere he his Tongue:<br>

And I, my Percies death, ere thou report'st it.<br>

This, thou would'st say: Your Sonne did thus, and thus:<br>

Your Brother, thus. So fought the Noble Dowglas,<br>

Stopping my greedy eare, with their bold deeds.<br>

But in the end (to stop mine Eare indeed)<br>

Thou hast a Sigh, to blow away this Praise,<br>

Ending with Brother, Sonne, and all are dead<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12373">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. Dowglas is liuing, and your Brother, yet:<br>

But for my Lord, your Sonne<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12374">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. Why, he is dead.<br>

See what a ready tongue Suspition hath:<br>

He that but feares the thing, he would not know,<br>

Hath by Instinct, knowledge from others Eyes,<br>

That what he feard, is chanc'd. Yet speake (Morton)<br>

Tell thou thy Earle, his Diuination Lies,<br>

And I will take it, as a sweet Disgrace,<br>

And make thee rich, for doing me such wrong<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12375">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. You are too great, to be (by me) gainsaid:<br>

Your Spirit is too true, your Feares too certaine<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12376">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. Yet for all this, say not that Percies dead.<br>

I see a strange Confession in thine Eye:<br>

Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it Feare, or Sinne,<br>

To speake a truth. If he be slaine, say so:<br>

The Tongue offends not, that reports his death:<br>

And he doth sinne that doth belye the dead:<br>

Not he, which sayes the dead is not aliue:<br>

Yet the first bringer of vnwelcome Newes<br>

Hath but a loosing Office: and his Tongue,<br>

Sounds euer after as a sullen Bell<br>

Remembred, knolling a departing Friend<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12377"> L.Bar. I cannot thinke (my Lord) your son is dead</p><br>

<p id="id12378">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. I am sorry, I should force you to beleeue<br>

That, which I would to heauen, I had not seene.<br>

But these mine eyes, saw him in bloody state,<br>

Rend'ring faint quittance (wearied, and out-breath'd)<br>

To Henrie Monmouth, whose swift wrath beate downe<br>

The neuer-daunted Percie to the earth,<br>

From whence (with life) he neuer more sprung vp.<br>

In few; his death (whose spirit lent a fire,<br>

Euen to the dullest Peazant in his Campe)<br>

Being bruited once, tooke fire and heate away<br>

From the best temper'd Courage in his Troopes.<br>

For from his Mettle, was his Party steel'd;<br>

Which once, in him abated, all the rest<br>

Turn'd on themselues, like dull and heauy Lead:<br>

And as the Thing, that's heauy in it selfe,<br>

Vpon enforcement, flyes with greatest speede,<br>

So did our Men, heauy in Hotspurres losse,<br>

Lend to this weight, such lightnesse with their Feare,<br>

That Arrowes fled not swifter toward their ayme,<br>

Then did our Soldiers (ayming at their safety)<br>

Fly from the field. Then was that Noble Worcester<br>

Too soone ta'ne prisoner: and that furious Scot,<br>

(The bloody Dowglas) whose well-labouring sword<br>

Had three times slaine th' appearance of the King,<br>

Gan vaile his stomacke, and did grace the shame<br>

Of those that turn'd their backes: and in his flight,<br>

Stumbling in Feare, was tooke. The summe of all,<br>

Is, that the King hath wonne: and hath sent out<br>

A speedy power, to encounter you my Lord,<br>

Vnder the Conduct of yong Lancaster<br>

And Westmerland. This is the Newes at full<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12379">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. For this, I shall haue time enough to mourne.<br>

In Poyson, there is Physicke: and this newes<br>

(Hauing beene well) that would haue made me sicke,<br>

Being sicke, haue in some measure, made me well.<br>

And as the Wretch, whose Feauer-weakned ioynts,<br>

Like strengthlesse Hindges, buckle vnder life,<br>

Impatient of his Fit, breakes like a fire<br>

Out of his keepers armes: Euen so, my Limbes<br>

(Weak'ned with greefe) being now inrag'd with greefe,<br>

Are thrice themselues. Hence therefore thou nice crutch,<br>

A scalie Gauntlet now, with ioynts of Steele<br>

Must gloue this hand. And hence thou sickly Quoife,<br>

Thou art a guard too wanton for the head,<br>

Which Princes, flesh'd with Conquest, ayme to hit.<br>

Now binde my Browes with Iron and approach<br>

The ragged'st houre, that Time and Spight dare bring<br>

To frowne vpon th' enrag'd Northumberland.<br>

Let Heauen kisse Earth: now let not Natures hand<br>

Keepe the wilde Flood confin'd: Let Order dye,<br>

And let the world no longer be a stage<br>

To feede Contention in a ling'ring Act:<br>

But let one spirit of the First-borne Caine<br>

Reigne in all bosomes, that each heart being set<br>

On bloody Courses, the rude Scene may end,<br>

And darknesse be the burier of the dead<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12380"> L.Bar. Sweet Earle, diuorce not wisedom from your Honor</p><br>

<p id="id12381">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. The liues of all your louing Complices<br>

Leane-on your health, the which if you giue-o're<br>

To stormy Passion, must perforce decay.<br>

You cast th' euent of Warre (my Noble Lord)<br>

And summ'd the accompt of Chance, before you said<br>

Let vs make head: It was your presurmize,<br>

That in the dole of blowes, your Son might drop.<br>

You knew he walk'd o're perils, on an edge<br>

More likely to fall in, then to get o're:<br>

You were aduis'd his flesh was capeable<br>

Of Wounds, and Scarres; and that his forward Spirit<br>

Would lift him, where most trade of danger rang'd,<br>

Yet did you say go forth: and none of this<br>

(Though strongly apprehended) could restraine<br>

The stiffe-borne Action: What hath then befalne?<br>

Or what hath this bold enterprize bring forth,<br>

More then that Being, which was like to be?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. We all that are engaged to this losse,<br>

Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous Seas,<br>

That if we wrought out life, was ten to one:<br>

And yet we ventur'd for the gaine propos'd,<br>

Choak'd the respect of likely perill fear'd,<br>

And since we are o're-set, venture againe.<br>

Come, we will all put forth; Body, and Goods,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor. 'Tis more then time: And (my most Noble Lord)<br>

I heare for certaine, and do speake the truth:<br>

The gentle Arch-bishop of Yorke is vp<br>

With well appointed Powres: he is a man<br>

Who with a double Surety bindes his Followers.<br>

My Lord (your Sonne) had onely but the Corpes,<br>

But shadowes, and the shewes of men to fight.<br>

For that same word (Rebellion) did diuide<br>

The action of their bodies, from their soules,<br>

And they did fight with queasinesse, constrain'd<br>

As men drinke Potions; that their Weapons only<br>

Seem'd on our side: but for their Spirits and Soules,<br>

This word (Rebellion) it had froze them vp,<br>

As Fish are in a Pond. But now the Bishop<br>

Turnes Insurrection to Religion,<br>

Suppos'd sincere, and holy in his Thoughts:<br>

He's follow'd both with Body, and with Minde:<br>

And doth enlarge his Rising, with the blood<br>

Of faire King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones,<br>

Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cause:<br>

Tels them, he doth bestride a bleeding Land,<br>

Gasping for life, vnder great Bullingbrooke,<br>

And more, and lesse, do flocke to follow him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12382">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North. I knew of this before. But to speake truth,<br>

This present greefe had wip'd it from my minde.<br>

Go in with me, and councell euery man<br>

The aptest way for safety, and reuenge:<br>

Get Posts, and Letters, and make Friends with speed,<br>

Neuer so few, nor neuer yet more need.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12383">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id12384" style="margin-top: 2em">Scena Tertia.</p><br>

<p id="id12385">Enter Falstaffe, and Page.</p><br>

<p id="id12386">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Sirra, you giant, what saies the Doct[or]. to my water?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pag. He said sir, the water it selfe was a good healthy<br>

water: but for the party that ow'd it, he might haue more<br>

diseases then he knew for<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12387"> Fal. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at mee: the
braine of this foolish compounded Clay-man, is not able
to inuent any thing that tends to laughter, more then I
inuent, or is inuented on me. I am not onely witty in my
selfe, but the cause that wit is in other men. I doe heere
walke before thee, like a Sow, that hath o'rewhelm'd all
her Litter, but one. If the Prince put thee into my Seruice
for any other reason, then to set mee off, why then I
haue no iudgement. Thou horson Mandrake, thou art
fitter to be worne in my cap, then to wait at my heeles. I
was neuer mann'd with an Agot till now: but I will sette
you neyther in Gold, nor Siluer, but in vilde apparell, and
send you backe againe to your Master, for a Iewell. The
Iuuenall (the Prince your Master) whose Chin is not yet
fledg'd, I will sooner haue a beard grow in the Palme of
my hand, then he shall get one on his cheeke: yet he will
not sticke to say, his Face is a Face-Royall. Heauen may
finish it when he will, it is not a haire amisse yet: he may
keepe it still at a Face-Royall, for a Barber shall neuer
earne six pence out of it; and yet he will be crowing, as if
he had writ man euer since his Father was a Batchellour.
He may keepe his owne Grace, but he is almost out of
mine, I can assure him. What said M[aster]. Dombledon, about
the Satten for my short Cloake, and Slops?
 Pag. He said sir, you should procure him better Assurance,
then Bardolfe: he wold not take his Bond &amp; yours,
he lik'd not the Security</p><br>

<p id="id12388"> Fal. Let him bee damn'd like the Glutton, may his
Tongue be hotter, a horson Achitophel; a
Rascally-yea-forsooth-knaue,
to beare a Gentleman in hand, and then
stand vpon Security? The horson smooth-pates doe now
weare nothing but high shoes, and bunches of Keyes at
their girdles: and if a man is through with them in honest
Taking-vp, then they must stand vpon Securitie: I
had as liefe they would put Rats-bane in my mouth, as
offer to stoppe it with Security. I look'd hee should haue
sent me two and twenty yards of Satten (as I am true
Knight) and he sends me Security. Well, he may sleep in
Security, for he hath the horne of Abundance: and the
lightnesse of his Wife shines through it, and yet cannot
he see, though he haue his owne Lanthorne to light him.
Where's Bardolfe?
 Pag. He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship
a horse</p><br>

<p id="id12389"> Fal. I bought him in Paules, and hee'l buy mee a horse
in Smithfield. If I could get mee a wife in the Stewes, I
were Mann'd, Hors'd, and Wiu'd.
Enter Chiefe Iustice, and Seruant.</p><br>

<p id="id12390" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%"> Pag. Sir, heere comes the Nobleman that committed
the Prince for striking him, about Bardolfe</p><br>

<p id="id12391"> Fal. Wait close, I will not see him</p><br>

<p id="id12392">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. What's he that goes there?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. Falstaffe, and't please your Lordship<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12393">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. He that was in question for the Robbery?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser. He my Lord, but he hath since done good seruice<br>

at Shrewsbury: and (as I heare) is now going with some<br>

Charge, to the Lord Iohn of Lancaster<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12394"> Iust. What to Yorke? Call him backe againe</p><br>

<p id="id12395"> Ser. Sir Iohn Falstaffe</p><br>

<p id="id12396"> Fal. Boy, tell him, I am deafe</p><br>

<p id="id12397"> Pag. You must speake lowder, my Master is deafe</p><br>

<p id="id12398">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.<br>

Go plucke him by the Elbow, I must speake with him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12399"> Ser. Sir Iohn</p><br>

<p id="id12400"> Fal. What? a yong knaue and beg? Is there not wars? Is
there not imployment? Doth not the K[ing]. lack subiects? Do
not the Rebels want Soldiers? Though it be a shame to be
on any side but one, it is worse shame to begge, then to
be on the worst side, were it worse then the name of Rebellion
can tell how to make it</p><br>

<p id="id12401"> Ser. You mistake me Sir</p><br>

<p id="id12402"> Fal. Why sir? Did I say you were an honest man? Setting
my Knight-hood, and my Souldiership aside, I had
lyed in my throat, if I had said so</p><br>

<p id="id12403"> Ser. I pray you (Sir) then set your Knighthood and
your Souldier-ship aside, and giue mee leaue to tell you,
you lye in your throat, if you say I am any other then an
honest man</p><br>

<p id="id12404"> Fal. I giue thee leaue to tell me so? I lay a-side that
which growes to me? If thou get'st any leaue of me, hang
me: if thou tak'st leaue, thou wer't better be hang'd: you
Hunt-counter, hence: Auant</p><br>

<p id="id12405"> Ser. Sir, my Lord would speake with you</p><br>

<p id="id12406"> Iust. Sir Iohn Falstaffe, a word with you</p><br>

<p id="id12407"> Fal. My good Lord: giue your Lordship good time of
the day. I am glad to see your Lordship abroad: I heard
say your Lordship was sicke. I hope your Lordship goes
abroad by aduise. Your Lordship (though not clean past
your youth) hath yet some smack of age in you: some rellish
of the saltnesse of Time, and I most humbly beseech
your Lordship, to haue a reuerend care of your health</p><br>

<p id="id12408">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. Sir Iohn, I sent you before your Expedition, to<br>

Shrewsburie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12409">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. If it please your Lordship, I heare his Maiestie is<br>

return'd with some discomfort from Wales<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12410">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. I talke not of his Maiesty: you would not come<br>

when I sent for you?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. And I heare moreouer, his Highnesse is falne into<br>

this same whorson Apoplexie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12411"> Iust. Well, heauen mend him. I pray let me speak with you</p><br>

<p id="id12412" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fal. This Apoplexie is (as I take it) a kind of Lethargie,
a sleeping of the blood, a horson Tingling</p><br>

<p id="id12413"> Iust. What tell you me of it? be it as it is</p><br>

<p id="id12414"> Fal. It hath it originall from much greefe; from study
and perturbation of the braine. I haue read the cause of
his effects in Galen. It is a kinde of deafenesse</p><br>

<p id="id12415">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. I thinke you are falne into the disease: For you<br>

heare not what I say to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12416"> Fal. Very well (my Lord) very well: rather an't please
you) it is the disease of not Listning, the malady of not
Marking, that I am troubled withall</p><br>

<p id="id12417"> Iust. To punish you by the heeles, would amend the
attention of your eares, &amp; I care not if I be your Physitian
 Fal. I am as poore as Iob, my Lord; but not so Patient:
your Lordship may minister the Potion of imprisonment
to me, in respect of Pouertie: but how I should bee your
Patient, to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make
some dram of a scruple, or indeede, a scruple it selfe</p><br>

<p id="id12418">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. I sent for you (when there were matters against<br>

you for your life) to come speake with me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12419">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. As I was then aduised by my learned Councel, in<br>

the lawes of this Land-seruice, I did not come<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12420">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. Wel, the truth is (sir Iohn) you liue in great infamy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. He that buckles him in my belt, ca[n]not liue in lesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12421"> Iust. Your Meanes is very slender, and your wast great</p><br>

<p id="id12422" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fal. I would it were otherwise: I would my Meanes
were greater, and my waste slenderer</p><br>

<p id="id12423"> Iust. You haue misled the youthfull Prince</p><br>

<p id="id12424" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fal. The yong Prince hath misled mee. I am the Fellow
with the great belly, and he my Dogge</p><br>

<p id="id12425"> Iust. Well, I am loth to gall a new-heal'd wound: your
daies seruice at Shrewsbury, hath a little gilded ouer
your Nights exploit on Gads-hill. You may thanke the
vnquiet time, for your quiet o're-posting that Action</p><br>

<p id="id12426">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. My Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. But since all is wel, keep it so: wake not a sleeping Wolfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12427"> Fal. To wake a Wolfe, is as bad as to smell a Fox</p><br>

<p id="id12428">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iu. What? you are as a candle, the better part burnt out<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. A Wassell-Candle, my Lord; all Tallow: if I did<br>

say of wax, my growth would approue the truth<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12429">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. There is not a white haire on your face, but shold<br>

haue his effect of grauity<br>

<p id="id12430"> Fal. His effect of grauy, grauy, grauy</p><br>

<p id="id12431" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Iust. You follow the yong Prince vp and downe, like
his euill Angell</p><br>

<p id="id12432"> Fal. Not so (my Lord) your ill Angell is light: but I
hope, he that lookes vpon mee, will take mee without,
weighing: and yet, in some respects I grant, I cannot go:
I cannot tell. Vertue is of so little regard in these Costormongers,
that true valor is turn'd Beare-heard. Pregnancie
is made a Tapster, and hath his quicke wit wasted in
giuing Recknings: all the other gifts appertinent to man
(as the malice of this Age shapes them) are not woorth a
Gooseberry. You that are old, consider not the capacities
of vs that are yong: you measure the heat of our Liuers,
with the bitternes of your gals: &amp; we that are in the
vaward of our youth, I must confesse, are wagges too</p><br>

<p id="id12433"> Iust. Do you set downe your name in the scrowle of
youth, that are written downe old, with all the Charracters
of age? Haue you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yellow
cheeke? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an incresing
belly? Is not your voice broken? your winde short? your
wit single? and euery part about you blasted with Antiquity?
and wil you cal your selfe yong? Fy, fy, fy, sir Iohn</p><br>

<p id="id12434"> Fal. My Lord, I was borne with a white head, &amp; somthing
a round belly. For my voice, I haue lost it with hallowing
and singing of Anthemes. To approue my youth
farther, I will not: the truth is, I am onely olde in iudgement
and vnderstanding: and he that will caper with mee
for a thousand Markes, let him lend me the mony, &amp; haue
at him. For the boxe of th' eare that the Prince gaue you,
he gaue it like a rude Prince, and you tooke it like a sensible
Lord. I haue checkt him for it, and the yong Lion repents:
Marry not in ashes and sacke-cloath, but in new
Silke, and old Sacke</p><br>

<p id="id12435"> Iust. Wel, heauen send the Prince a better companion</p><br>

<p id="id12436" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fal. Heauen send the Companion a better Prince: I
cannot rid my hands of him</p><br>

<p id="id12437"> Iust. Well, the King hath seuer'd you and Prince Harry,
I heare you are going with Lord Iohn of Lancaster, against
the Archbishop, and the Earle of Northumberland
 Fal. Yes, I thanke your pretty sweet wit for it: but
looke you pray, (all you that kisse my Ladie Peace, at
home) that our Armies ioyn not in a hot day: for if I take
but two shirts out with me, and I meane not to sweat
extraordinarily:
if it bee a hot day, if I brandish any thing
but my Bottle, would I might neuer spit white againe:
There is not a daungerous Action can peepe out his head,
but I am thrust vpon it. Well, I cannot last euer</p><br>

<p id="id12438">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. Well, be honest, be honest, and heauen blesse your<br>

Expedition<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12439">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Will your Lordship lend mee a thousand pound,<br>

to furnish me forth?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iust. Not a peny, not a peny: you are too impatient<br>

to beare crosses. Fare you well. Commend mee to my<br>

Cosin Westmerland<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12440"> Fal. If I do, fillop me with a three-man-Beetle. A man
can no more separate Age and Couetousnesse, then he can
part yong limbes and letchery: but the Gowt galles the
one, and the pox pinches the other; and so both the Degrees
preuent my curses. Boy?
 Page. Sir</p><br>

<p id="id12441">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. What money is in my purse?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Page. Seuen groats, and two pence<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12442"> Fal. I can get no remedy against this Consumption of
the purse. Borrowing onely lingers, and lingers it out,
but the disease is incureable. Go beare this letter to my
Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earle of
Westmerland, and this to old Mistris Vrsula, whome I
haue weekly sworne to marry, since I perceiu'd the first
white haire on my chin. About it: you know where to
finde me. A pox of this Gowt, or a Gowt of this Poxe:
for the one or th' other playes the rogue with my great
toe: It is no matter, if I do halt, I haue the warres for my
colour, and my Pension shall seeme the more reasonable.
A good wit will make vse of any thing: I will turne diseases
to commodity.</p><br>

<p id="id12445">Enter Archbishop, Hastings, Mowbray, and Lord Bardolfe.</p><br>

<p id="id12446">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. Thus haue you heard our causes, &amp; kno our Means:<br>

And my most noble Friends, I pray you all<br>

Speake plainly your opinions of our hopes,<br>

And first (Lord Marshall) what say you to it?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. I well allow the occasion of our Armes,<br>

But gladly would be better satisfied,<br>

How (in our Meanes) we should aduance our selues<br>

To looke with forhead bold and big enough<br>

Vpon the Power and puisance of the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12447">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Our present Musters grow vpon the File<br>

To fiue and twenty thousand men of choice:<br>

And our Supplies, liue largely in the hope<br>

Of great Northumberland, whose bosome burnes<br>

With an incensed Fire of Iniuries<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12448">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. The question then (Lord Hastings) standeth thus<br>

Whether our present fiue and twenty thousand<br>

May hold-vp-head, without Northumberland:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. With him, we may<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12449">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. I marry, there's the point:<br>

But if without him we be thought to feeble,<br>

My iudgement is, we should not step too farre<br>

Till we had his Assistance by the hand.<br>

For in a Theame so bloody fac'd, as this,<br>

Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise<br>

Of Aydes incertaine, should not be admitted<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12450">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arch. 'Tis very true Lord Bardolfe, for indeed<br>

It was yong Hotspurres case, at Shrewsbury<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12451">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. It was (my Lord) who lin'd himself with hope,<br>

Eating the ayre, on promise of Supply,<br>

Flatt'ring himselfe with Proiect of a power,<br>

Much smaller, then the smallest of his Thoughts,<br>

And so with great imagination<br>

(Proper to mad men) led his Powers to death,<br>

And (winking) leap'd into destruction<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12452">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. But (by your leaue) it neuer yet did hurt,<br>

To lay downe likely-hoods, and formes of hope<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12453">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. Yes, if this present quality of warre,<br>

Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot,<br>

Liues so in hope: As in an early Spring,<br>

We see th' appearing buds, which to proue fruite,<br>

Hope giues not so much warrant, as Dispaire<br>

That Frosts will bite them. When we meane to build,<br>

We first suruey the Plot, then draw the Modell,<br>

And when we see the figure of the house,<br>

Then must we rate the cost of the Erection,<br>

Which if we finde out-weighes Ability,<br>

What do we then, but draw a-new the Modell<br>

In fewer offices? Or at least, desist<br>

To builde at all? Much more, in this great worke,<br>

(Which is (almost) to plucke a Kingdome downe,<br>

And set another vp) should we suruey<br>

The plot of Situation, and the Modell;<br>

Consent vpon a sure Foundation:<br>

Question Surueyors, know our owne estate,<br>

How able such a Worke to vndergo,<br>

To weigh against his Opposite? Or else,<br>

We fortifie in Paper, and in Figures,<br>

Vsing the Names of men, instead of men:<br>

Like one, that drawes the Modell of a house<br>

Beyond his power to builde it; who (halfe through)<br>

Giues o're, and leaues his part-created Cost<br>

A naked subiect to the Weeping Clouds,<br>

And waste, for churlish Winters tyranny<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12454">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Grant that our hopes (yet likely of faire byrth)<br>

Should be still-borne: and that we now possest<br>

The vtmost man of expectation:<br>

I thinke we are a Body strong enough<br>

(Euen as we are) to equall with the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12455">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. What is the King but fiue &amp; twenty thousand?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. To vs no more: nay not so much Lord Bardolf.<br>

For0his diuisions (as the Times do braul)<br>

Are in three Heads: one Power against the French,<br>

And one against Glendower: Perforce a third<br>

Must take vp vs: So is the vnfirme King<br>

In three diuided: and his Coffers sound<br>

With hollow Pouerty, and Emptinesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12456">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar. That he should draw his seuerall strengths togither<br>

And come against vs in full puissance<br>

Need not be dreaded<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12457">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. If he should do so,<br>

He leaues his backe vnarm'd, the French, and Welch<br>

Baying him at the heeles: neuer feare that<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12458">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.Bar. Who is it like should lead his Forces hither?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. The Duke of Lancaster, and Westmerland:<br>

Against the Welsh himselfe, and Harrie Monmouth.<br>

But who is substituted 'gainst the French,<br>

I haue no certaine notice<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12459">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arch. Let vs on:<br>

And publish the occasion of our Armes.<br>

The Common-wealth is sicke of their owne Choice,<br>

Their ouer-greedy loue hath surfetted:<br>

An habitation giddy, and vnsure<br>

Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.<br>

O thou fond Many, with what loud applause<br>

Did'st thou beate heauen with blessing Bullingbrooke,<br>

Before he was, what thou would'st haue him be?<br>

And being now trimm'd in thine owne desires,<br>

Thou (beastly Feeder) art so full of him,<br>

That thou prouok'st thy selfe to cast him vp.<br>

So, so, (thou common Dogge) did'st thou disgorge<br>

Thy glutton-bosome of the Royall Richard,<br>

And now thou would'st eate thy dead vomit vp,<br>

And howl'st to finde it. What trust is in these Times?<br>

They, that when Richard liu'd, would haue him dye,<br>

Are now become enamour'd on his graue.<br>

Thou that threw'st dust vpon his goodly head<br>

When through proud London he came sighing on,<br>

After th' admired heeles of Bullingbrooke,<br>

Cri'st now, O Earth, yeeld vs that King againe,<br>

And take thou this (O thoughts of men accurs'd)<br>

``Past, and to Come, seemes best; things Present, worst<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12460">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?<br>

 Hostesse. Alas the day: take heed of him: he stabd me
in mine owne house, and that most beastly: he cares not

foyne like any diuell, he will spare neither man, woman,

continuantly

and hee is indited to dinner to the Lubbars head in

Doth this become your place, your time, and businesse?<br>

<p id="id12485"> Ch.Iust. For what summe?
 Host. It is more then for some (my Lord) it is for all: all
I haue, he hath eaten me out of house and home; hee hath
put all my substance into that fat belly of his: but I will
haue some of it out againe, or I will ride thee o' Nights,
like the Mare</p><br>

good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
Are you not asham'd to inforce a poore Widdowe to so
rough a course, to come by her owne?
 Falst. What is the grosse summe that I owe thee?
 Host. Marry (if thou wer't an honest man) thy selfe, &amp;
the mony too. Thou didst sweare to mee vpon a parcell
gilt Goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber at the round
table, by a sea-cole fire, on Wednesday in Whitson week,
when the Prince broke thy head for lik'ning him to a singing
man of Windsor; Thou didst sweare to me then (as I
was washing thy wound) to marry me, and make mee my
Lady thy wife. Canst y deny it? Did not goodwife Keech
the Butchers wife come in then, and cal me gossip Quickly?
comming in to borrow a messe of Vinegar: telling vs,
she had a good dish of Prawnes: whereby y didst desire to
eat some: whereby I told thee they were ill for a greene
wound? And didst not thou (when she was gone downe
staires) desire me to be no more familiar with such poore
people, saying, that ere long they should call me Madam?
And did'st y not kisse me, and bid mee fetch thee 30.s? I
put thee now to thy Book-oath, deny it if thou canst?
 Fal. My Lord, this is a poore mad soule: and she sayes
vp &amp; downe the town, that her eldest son is like you. She
hath bin in good case, &amp; the truth is, pouerty hath distracted
her: but for these foolish Officers, I beseech you, I
may haue redresse against them</p><br>

<p id="id12488"> Iust. Sir Iohn, sir Iohn, I am well acquainted with your
maner of wrenching the true cause, the false way. It is not
a confident brow, nor the throng of wordes, that come
with such (more then impudent) sawcines from you, can
thrust me from a leuell consideration, I know you ha' practis'd
vpon the easie-yeelding spirit of this woman</p><br>

<p id="id12489"> Host. Yes in troth my Lord</p><br>

<p id="id12490"> Iust. Prethee peace: pay her the debt you owe her, and
vnpay the villany you haue done her: the one you may do
with sterling mony, &amp; the other with currant repentance</p><br>

<p id="id12491"> Fal. My Lord, I will not vndergo this sneape without
reply. You call honorable Boldnes, impudent Sawcinesse:
If a man wil curt'sie, and say nothing, he is vertuous: No,
my Lord (your humble duty reme[m]bred) I will not be your
sutor. I say to you, I desire deliu'rance from these Officers
being vpon hasty employment in the Kings Affaires</p><br>

<p id="id12496">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. As I am a Gentleman. Come, no more words of it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. By this Heauenly ground I tread on, I must be<br>

faine to pawne both my Plate, and the Tapistry of my dyning<br>

Chambers<br>

<p id="id12497"> Fal. Glasses, glasses, is the onely drinking: and for
thy walles a pretty slight Drollery, or the Storie of the
Prodigall, or the Germane hunting in Waterworke, is
worth a thousand of these Bed-hangings, and these Flybitten
Tapistries. Let it be tenne pound (if thou canst.)
Come, if it were not for thy humors, there is not a better
Wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw thy

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. What foolish Master taught you these manners,<br>

Sir Iohn?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Master Gower, if they become mee not, hee was a<br>

not haue attach'd one of so high blood</p><br>

<p id="id12516"> Prin. It doth me: though it discolours the complexion
of my Greatnesse to acknowledge it. Doth it not shew
vildely in me, to desire small Beere?
 Poin. Why, a Prince should not be so loosely studied,
as to remember so weake a Composition</p><br>

<p id="id12517"> Prince. Belike then, my Appetite was not Princely
got: for (in troth) I do now remember the poore Creature,
Small Beere. But indeede these humble considerations
make me out of loue with my Greatnesse. What a
disgrace is it to me, to remember thy name? Or to know
thy face to morrow? Or to take note how many paire of
Silk stockings y hast? (Viz. these, and those that were thy
peach-colour'd ones:) Or to beare the Inuentorie of thy
shirts, as one for superfluity, and one other, for vse. But
that the Tennis-Court-keeper knowes better then I, for
it is a low ebbe of Linnen with thee, when thou kept'st
not Racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, because
the rest of thy Low Countries, haue made a shift to
eate vp thy Holland</p><br>

<p id="id12518">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. How ill it followes, after you haue labour'd so<br>

I could be sad, and sad indeed too</p><br>

<p id="id12522"> Poin. Very hardly, vpon such a subiect</p><br>

<p id="id12523"> Prin. Thou think'st me as farre in the Diuels Booke, as

<p id="id12524">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. The reason?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. What would'st thou think of me, if I shold weep?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. I would thinke thee a most Princely hypocrite<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12525"> Prin. It would be euery mans thought: and thou art
a blessed Fellow, to thinke as euery man thinkes: neuer a
mans thought in the world, keepes the Rode-way better
then thine: euery man would thinke me an Hypocrite indeede.
And what accites your most worshipful thought
to thinke so?
 Poin. Why, because you haue beene so lewde, and so
much ingraffed to Falstaffe</p><br>

<p id="id12526"> Prin. And to thee</p><br>

<p id="id12527"> Pointz. Nay, I am well spoken of, I can heare it with
mine owne eares: the worst that they can say of me is, that
I am a second Brother, and that I am a proper Fellowe of
my hands: and those two things I confesse I canot helpe.
Looke, looke, here comes Bardolfe</p><br>

a Maidenly man at Armes are you become? Is it such a

I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leaue thee. Bee
not too familiar with Pointz, for hee misuses thy Fauours so

at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewell.
Thine, by yea and no: which is as much as to say, as thou
vsest him. Iacke Falstaffe with my Familiars:

Iohn, with all Europe.

waite vpon him at his Table, like Drawers<br>

The Time was (Father) when you broke your word,<br>

When you were more endeer'd to it, then now,<br>

When your owne Percy, when my heart-deereHarry,<br>

Threw many a Northward looke, to see his Father<br>

Bring vp his Powres: but he did long in vaine.<br>

Who then perswaded you to stay at home?<br>

There were two Honors lost; Yours, and your Sonnes.<br>

For Yours, may heauenly glory brighten it:<br>

For His, it stucke vpon him, as the Sunne<br>

In the gray vault of Heauen: and by his Light<br>

Did all the Cheualrie of England moue<br>

To do braue Acts. He was (indeed) the Glasse<br>

Wherein the Noble-Youth did dresse themselues.<br>

He had no Legges, that practic'd not his Gate:<br>

And speaking thicke (which Nature made his blemish)<br>

Became the Accents of the Valiant.<br>

For those that could speake low, and tardily,<br>

Would turne their owne Perfection, to Abuse,<br>

To seeme like him. So that in Speech, in Gate,<br>

In Diet, in Affections of delight,<br>

In Militarie Rules, Humors of Blood,<br>

He was the Marke, and Glasse, Coppy, and Booke,<br>

That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous! him,<br>

O Miracle of Men! Him did you leaue<br>

(Second to none) vn-seconded by you,<br>

In dis-aduantage, to abide a field,<br>

Where nothing but the sound of Hotspurs Name<br>

And neuer shall haue length of Life enough,<br>

<p id="id12584"> Host. Sweet-heart, me thinkes now you are in an excellent
good temperalitie: your Pulsidge beates as extraordinarily,
as heart would desire; and your Colour
(I warrant you) is as red as any Rose: But you haue
drunke too much Canaries, and that's a maruellous searching
Wine; and it perfumes the blood, ere wee can say

 Dol. Better then I was: Hem</p><br>

brauely; to venture vpon the charg'd-Chambers
brauely</p><br>

<p id="id12593"> Host. Why this is the olde fashion: you two neuer

good-yere? One must beare, and that must bee you:
you are the weaker Vessell; as they say, the emptier

him vp (Drawer.)
 Host. Cheater, call you him? I will barre no honest

<p id="id12634"> Host. Here's a goodly tumult: Ile forsweare keeping
house, before Ile be in these tirrits, and frights. So: Murther
I warrant now. Alas, alas, put vp your naked Weapons,
put vp your naked Weapons</p><br>

<p id="id12636">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. Are you not hurt i'th' Groyne? me thought hee<br>

made a shrewd Thrust at your Belly<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. Yes Sir: the Rascall's drunke: you haue hurt<br>

him (Sir) in the shoulder<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12638"> Fal. A Rascall to braue me</p><br>

<p id="id12639"> Dol. Ah, you sweet little Rogue, you: alas, poore Ape,
how thou sweat'st? Come, let me wipe thy Face: Come
on, you whorson Chops: Ah Rogue, I loue thee: Thou
art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth fiue of Agamemnon,
and tenne times better then the nine Worthies: ah
Villaine</p><br>

<p id="id12640"> Fal. A rascally Slaue, I will tosse the Rogue in a Blanket</p><br>

Ile canuas thee betweene a paire of Sheetes.<br>

Enter Musique.<br>

A Rascall, bragging Slaue: the Rogue fled from me like<br>

Quick-siluer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12644"> Dol. And thou followd'st him like a Church: thou
whorson little tydie Bartholmew Bore-pigge, when wilt
thou leaue fighting on dayes, and foyning on nights, and
begin to patch vp thine old Body for Heauen?
Enter the Prince and Poines disguis'd.</p><br>

<p id="id12645">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Peace (good Dol) doe not speake like a Deathshead:<br>

doe not bid me remember mine end<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12646">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. Sirrha, what humor is the Prince of?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. A good shallow young fellow: hee would haue<br>

made a good Pantler, hee would haue chipp'd Bread<br>

well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12647"> Dol. They say Poines hath a good Wit</p><br>

<p id="id12648"> Fal. Hee a good Wit? hang him Baboone, his Wit is
as thicke as Tewksburie Mustard: there is no more conceit
in him, then is in a Mallet</p><br>

<p id="id12649"> Dol. Why doth the Prince loue him so then?
 Fal. Because their Legges are both of a bignesse: and
hee playes at Quoits well, and eates Conger and Fennell,
and drinkes off Candles ends for Flap-dragons, and rides
the wilde-Mare with the Boyes, and iumpes vpon Ioyn'dstooles,
and sweares with a good grace, and weares his
Boot very smooth, like vnto the Signe of the Legge; and
breedes no bate with telling of discreete stories: and such
other Gamboll Faculties hee hath, that shew a weake
Minde, and an able Body, for the which the Prince admits
him; for the Prince himselfe is such another: the
weight of an hayre will turne the Scales betweene their
Haberdepois</p><br>

<p id="id12650">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Would not this Naue of a Wheele haue his<br>

Eares cut off?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. Let vs beat him before his Whore<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12651">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Looke, if the wither'd Elder hath not his Poll<br>

claw'd like a Parrot<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12652">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. Is it not strange, that Desire should so many<br>

yeeres out-liue performance?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Kisse me Dol<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12653">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Saturne and Venus this yeere in Coniunction?<br>

What sayes the Almanack to that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Poin. And looke whether the fierie Trigon, his Man,<br>

be not lisping to his Masters old Tables, his Note-Booke,<br>

his Councell-keeper?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Thou do'st giue me flatt'ring Busses<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12654">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. Nay truely, I kisse thee with a most constant<br>

heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12655"> Fal. I am olde, I am olde</p><br>

Boy of them all<br>

<p id="id12657"> Fal. What Stuffe wilt thou haue a Kirtle of? I shall
receiue Money on Thursday: thou shalt haue a Cappe
to morrow. A merrie Song, come: it growes late,
wee will to Bed. Thou wilt forget me, when I am

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Why thou Globe of sinfull Continents, what<br>

a life do'st thou lead?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. A better then thou: I am a Gentleman, thou art<br>

a Drawer<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12662">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Very true, Sir: and I come to draw you out<br>

by the Eares<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12663"> Host. Oh, the Lord preserue thy good Grace: Welcome
to London. Now Heauen blesse that sweete Face
of thine: what, are you come from Wales?
 Fal. Thou whorson mad Compound of Maiestie: by
this light Flesh, and corrupt Blood, thou art welcome</p><br>

<p id="id12664"> Dol. How? you fat Foole, I scorne you</p><br>

<p id="id12665"> Poin. My Lord, hee will driue you out of your reuenge,
and turne all to a merryment, if you take not the
heat</p><br>

<p id="id12666"> Prince. You whorson Candle-myne you, how vildly
did you speake of me euen now, before this honest, vertuous,
ciuill Gentlewoman?
 Host. 'Blessing on your good heart, and so shee is by
my troth</p><br>

<p id="id12667">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Didst thou heare me?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. Yes: and you knew me, as you did when you<br>

ranne away by Gads-hill: you knew I was at your back,<br>

and spoke it on purpose, to trie my patience<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12668">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. No, no, no: not so: I did not thinke, thou wast<br>

within hearing<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12669">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. I shall driue you then to confesse the wilfull<br>

abuse, and then I know how to handle you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12670"> Fal. No abuse (Hall) on mine Honor, no abuse</p><br>

<p id="id12671"> Prince. Not to disprayse me? and call me Pantler, and
Bread-chopper, and I know not what?
 Fal. No abuse (Hal.)
 Poin. No abuse?
 Fal. No abuse (Ned) in the World: honest Ned none.
I disprays'd him before the Wicked, that the Wicked
might not fall in loue with him: In which doing, I haue
done the part of a carefull Friend, and a true Subiect, and
thy Father is to giue me thankes for it. No abuse (Hal:)
none (Ned) none; no Boyes, none</p><br>

<p id="id12672"> Prince. See now whether pure Feare, and entire Cowardise,
doth not make thee wrong this vertuous Gentlewoman,
to close with vs? Is shee of the Wicked? Is thine
Hostesse heere, of the Wicked? Or is the Boy of the
Wicked? Or honest Bardolph (whose Zeale burnes in his
Nose) of the Wicked?
 Poin. Answere thou dead Elme, answere</p><br>

<p id="id12673"> Fal. The Fiend hath prickt downe Bardolph irrecouerable,
and his Face is Lucifers Priuy-Kitchin, where hee
doth nothing but rost Mault-Wormes: for the Boy,
there is a good Angell about him, but the Deuill outbids
him too</p><br>

<p id="id12674"> Prince. For the Women?
 Fal. For one of them, shee is in Hell alreadie, and
burnes poore Soules: for the other, I owe her Money;
and whether shee bee damn'd for that, I know
not</p><br>

<p id="id12675"> Host. No, I warrant you</p><br>

<p id="id12676"> Fal. No, I thinke thou art not: I thinke thou art quit
for that. Marry, there is another Indictment vpon thee,
for suffering flesh to bee eaten in thy house, contrary to
the Law, for the which I thinke thou wilt howle</p><br>

<p id="id12677">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host. All Victuallers doe so: What is a Ioynt of<br>

Mutton, or two, in a whole Lent?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. You, Gentlewoman<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12678">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol. What sayes your Grace?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. His Grace sayes that, which his flesh rebells<br>

<p id="id12679"> Host. Who knocks so lowd at doore? Looke to the

&nbsp;&nbsp;Peto. The King, your Father, is at Westminster,<br>

And there are twentie weake and wearied Postes,<br>

Come from the North: and as I came along,<br>

I met, and ouer-tooke a dozen Captaines,<br>

Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the Tauernes,<br>

And asking euery one for Sir Iohn Falstaffe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12681">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. By Heauen (Poines) I feele me much to blame,<br>

So idly to prophane the precious time,<br>

When Tempest of Commotion, like the South,<br>

Borne with black Vapour, doth begin to melt,<br>

And drop vpon our bare vnarmed heads.<br>

Giue me my Sword, and Cloake:<br>

Falstaffe, good night.<br>

Enter.<br>

 Bard. You must away to Court, Sir, presently,
A dozen Captaines stay at doore for you</p><br>

<p id="id12683"> Falst. Pay the Musitians, Sirrha: farewell Hostesse,
farewell Dol. You see (my good Wenches) how men of
Merit are sought after: the vndeseruer may sleepe, when
the man of Action is call'd on. Farewell good Wenches:
if I be not sent away poste, I will see you againe, ere I

<p id="id12684"> Dol. I cannot speake: if my heart bee not readie

<p id="id12685">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Farewell, farewell.<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id12686"> Host. Well, fare thee well: I haue knowne thee

<p id="id12687"> Bard. Mistris Teare-sheet</p><br>

Into the Sea: and other Times, to see<br>

The beachie Girdle of the Ocean<br>

Too wide for Neptunes hippes; how Chances mocks<br>

Did speake these words (now prou'd a Prophecie:)<br>

Northumberland, thou Ladder, by the which<br>

My Cousin Bullingbrooke ascends my Throne:<br>

(Though then, Heauen knowes, I had no such intent,<br>

But that necessitie so bow'd the State,<br>

The Time shall come (thus did hee follow it)<br>

The Time will come, that foule Sinne gathering head,<br>

and Francis Pick-bone, and Will Squele a Cotsal-man, you
had not foure such Swindge-bucklers in all the Innes of
Court againe: And I may say to you, wee knew where

carryed you a fore-hand Shaft at foureteene, and foureteene

my Captaine, Sir Iohn Falstaffe: a tall Gentleman, and a

may I aske, how my Lady his Wife doth?
 Bard. Sir, pardon: a Souldier is better accommodated,

<p id="id12717"> Shal. It is well said, Sir; and it is well said, indeede,
too: Better accommodated? it is good, yea indeede is
it: good phrases are surely, and euery where very commendable.
Accommodated, it comes of Accommodo:
very good, a good Phrase</p><br>

call you it? by this Day, I know not the Phrase: but
I will maintaine the Word with my Sword, to bee a

</p><br>

<p id="id12726">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Is thy name Mouldie?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Moul. Yea, if it please you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12727"> Fal. 'Tis the more time thou wert vs'd</p><br>

<p id="id12728"> Shal. Ha, ha, ha, most excellent. Things that are mouldie,
lacke vse: very singular good. Well saide Sir Iohn,
very well said</p><br>

<p id="id12729"> Fal. Pricke him</p><br>

<p id="id12730"> Moul. I was prickt well enough before, if you could
haue let me alone: my old Dame will be vndone now, for
one to doe her Husbandry, and her Drudgery; you need
not to haue prickt me, there are other men fitter to goe
out, then I</p><br>

<p id="id12731">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Go too: peace Mouldie, you shall goe. Mouldie,<br>

it is time you were spent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12732">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moul. Spent?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shallow. Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: Know you<br>

where you are? For the other sir Iohn: Let me see: Simon<br>

Shadow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12733">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. I marry, let me haue him to sit vnder: he's like to<br>

be a cold souldier<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12734">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Where's Shadow?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shad. Heere sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12735">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Shadow, whose sonne art thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shad. My Mothers sonne, Sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12736"> Falst. Thy Mothers sonne: like enough, and thy Fathers
shadow: so the sonne of the Female, is the shadow
of the Male: it is often so indeede, but not of the Fathers
substance</p><br>

<p id="id12737">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Do you like him, sir Iohn?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Shadow will serue for Summer: pricke him: For<br>

wee haue a number of shadowes to fill vppe the Muster-Booke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12738">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Thomas Wart?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Where's he?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wart. Heere sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12739">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Is thy name Wart?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wart. Yea sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12740"> Fal. Thou art a very ragged Wart</p><br>

<p id="id12741"> Shal. Shall I pricke him downe,
Sir Iohn?
 Falst. It were superfluous: for his apparrel is built vpon
his backe, and the whole frame stands vpon pins: prick
him no more</p><br>

<p id="id12742">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Ha, ha, ha, you can do it sir: you can doe it: I<br>

commend you well.<br>

Francis Feeble<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12743"> Feeble. Heere sir</p><br>

<p id="id12744">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. What Trade art thou Feeble?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeble. A Womans Taylor sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12745"> Shal. Shall I pricke him, sir?
 Fal. You may:
But if he had beene a mans Taylor, he would haue prick'd
you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemies Battaile,
as thou hast done in a Womans petticote?
 Feeble. I will doe my good will sir, you can haue no
more</p><br>

<p id="id12746">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Well said, good Womans Tailour: Well sayde<br>

Couragious Feeble: thou wilt bee as valiant as the wrathfull<br>

Doue, or most magnanimous Mouse. Pricke the womans<br>

Taylour well Master Shallow, deepe Maister Shallow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12747"> Feeble. I would Wart might haue gone sir</p><br>

<p id="id12748"> Fal. I would thou wert a mans Tailor, that y might'st
mend him, and make him fit to goe. I cannot put him to
a priuate souldier, that is the Leader of so many thousands.
Let that suffice, most Forcible Feeble</p><br>

<p id="id12749"> Feeble. It shall suffice</p><br>

<p id="id12750">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. I am bound to thee, reuerend Feeble. Who is<br>

the next?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Peter Bulcalfe of the Greene<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12751"> Falst. Yea marry, let vs see Bulcalfe</p><br>

<p id="id12752"> Bul. Heere sir</p><br>

<p id="id12753" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Fal. Trust me, a likely Fellow. Come, pricke me Bulcalfe
till he roare againe</p><br>

<p id="id12754"> Bul. Oh, good my Lord Captaine</p><br>

<p id="id12755"> Fal. What? do'st thou roare before th'art prickt</p><br>

<p id="id12756"> Bul. Oh sir, I am a diseased man</p><br>

<p id="id12757">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. What disease hast thou?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bul. A whorson cold sir, a cough sir, which I caught<br>

with Ringing in the Kings affayres, vpon his Coronation<br>

day, sir<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12758"> Fal. Come, thou shalt go to the Warres in a Gowne:
we will haue away thy Cold, and I will take such order,
that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is heere all?
 Shal. There is two more called then your number:
you must haue but foure heere sir, and so I pray you go in
with me to dinner</p><br>

<p id="id12759"> Fal. Come, I will goe drinke with you, but I cannot
tarry dinner. I am glad to see you in good troth, Master
Shallow</p><br>

<p id="id12760">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. O sir Iohn, doe you remember since wee lay all<br>

night in the Winde-mill, in S[aint]. Georges Field<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12761">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falstaffe. No more of that good Master Shallow: No<br>

more of that<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12762">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Ha? it was a merry night. And is Iane Nightworke<br>

aliue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. She liues, M[aster]. Shallow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12763"> Shal. She neuer could away with me</p><br>

<p id="id12764">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fal. Neuer, neuer: she would alwayes say shee could<br>

not abide M[aster]. Shallow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12765">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. I could anger her to the heart: shee was then a<br>

Bona-Roba. Doth she hold her owne well<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12766"> Fal. Old, old, M[aster]. Shallow</p><br>

<p id="id12767"> Shal. Nay, she must be old, she cannot choose but be
old: certaine shee's old: and had Robin Night-worke, by
old Night-worke, before I came to Clements Inne</p><br>

<p id="id12768"> Sil. That's fiftie fiue yeeres agoe</p><br>

<p id="id12769">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Hah, Cousin Silence, that thou hadst seene that,<br>

that this Knight and I haue seene: hah, Sir Iohn, said I<br>

well?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Wee haue heard the Chymes at mid-night, Master<br>

Shallow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12770"> Shal. That wee haue, that wee haue; in faith, Sir Iohn,
wee haue: our watch-word was, Hem-Boyes. Come,
let's to Dinner; come, let's to Dinner: Oh the dayes that
wee haue seene. Come, come</p><br>

<p id="id12771"> Bul. Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my
friend, and heere is foure Harry tenne shillings in French
Crownes for you: in very truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd
sir, as goe: and yet, for mine owne part, sir, I do not care;
but rather, because I am vnwilling, and for mine owne
part, haue a desire to stay with my friends: else, sir, I did
not care, for mine owne part, so much</p><br>

<p id="id12772"> Bard. Go-too: stand aside</p><br>

<p id="id12773"> Mould. And good Master Corporall Captaine, for my
old Dames sake, stand my friend: shee hath no body to
doe any thing about her, when I am gone: and she is old,
and cannot helpe her selfe: you shall haue fortie, sir</p><br>

<p id="id12774"> Bard. Go-too: stand aside</p><br>

<p id="id12775"> Feeble. I care not, a man can die but once: wee owe a
death. I will neuer beare a base minde: if it be my destinie,
so: if it be not, so: no man is too good to serue his
Prince: and let it goe which way it will, he that dies this
yeere, is quit for the next</p><br>

<p id="id12776"> Bard. Well said, thou art a good fellow</p><br>

<p id="id12777"> Feeble. Nay, I will beare no base minde</p><br>

<p id="id12778">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Come sir, which men shall I haue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Foure of which you please<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12779">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. Sir, a word with you: I haue three pound, to<br>

free Mouldie and Bull-calfe<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12780"> Falst. Go-too: well</p><br>

<p id="id12781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Come, sir Iohn, which foure will you haue?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Doe you chuse for me<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12782">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Marry then, Mouldie, Bull-calfe, Feeble, and<br>

Shadow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12783"> Falst. Mouldie, and Bull-calfe: for you Mouldie, stay
at home, till you are past seruice: and for your part, Bull-calfe,
grow till you come vnto it: I will none of you</p><br>

<p id="id12784"> Shal. Sir Iohn, Sir Iohn, doe not your selfe wrong, they
are your likelyest men, and I would haue you seru'd with
the best</p><br>

<p id="id12785"> Falst. Will you tell me (Master Shallow) how to chuse
a man? Care I for the Limbe, the Thewes, the stature,
bulke, and bigge assemblance of a man? giue mee the
spirit (Master Shallow.) Where's Wart? you see what
a ragged appearance it is: hee shall charge you, and
discharge you, with the motion of a Pewterers Hammer:
come off, and on, swifter then hee that gibbets on
the Brewers Bucket. And this same halfe-fac'd fellow,
Shadow, giue me this man: hee presents no marke to the
Enemie, the foe-man may with as great ayme leuell at
the edge of a Pen-knife: and for a Retrait, how swiftly
will this Feeble, the Womans Taylor, runne off. O, giue
me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a
Calyuer into Warts hand, Bardolph</p><br>

<p id="id12786"> Bard. Hold Wart, Trauerse: thus, thus, thus</p><br>

<p id="id12787"> Falst. Come, manage me your Calyuer: so: very well,
go-too, very good, exceeding good. O, giue me alwayes
a little, leane, old, chopt, bald Shot. Well said Wart, thou
art a good Scab: hold, there is a Tester for thee</p><br>

<p id="id12788"> Shal. Hee is not his Crafts-master, hee doth not doe
it right. I remember at Mile-end-Greene, when I lay
at Clements Inne, I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthurs
Show: there was a little quiuer fellow, and hee would
manage you his Peece thus: and hee would about,
and about, and come you in, and come you in: Rah,
tah, tah, would hee say, Bownce would hee say, and
away againe would hee goe, and againe would he come:
I shall neuer see such a fellow</p><br>

<p id="id12789">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. These fellowes will doe well, Master Shallow.<br>

Farewell Master Silence, I will not vse many wordes with<br>

you: fare you well, Gentlemen both: I thanke you:<br>

I must a dozen mile to night. Bardolph, giue the Souldiers<br>

Coates<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12790">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Sir Iohn, Heauen blesse you, and prosper your<br>

Affaires, and send vs Peace. As you returne, visit<br>

my house. Let our old acquaintance be renewed: peraduenture<br>

I will with you to the Court<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12791"> Falst. I would you would, Master Shallow</p><br>

<p id="id12792">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shal. Go-too: I haue spoke at a word. Fare you<br>

well.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12793"> Falst. Fare you well, gentle Gentlemen. On Bardolph,
leade the men away. As I returne, I will fetch off
these Iustices: I doe see the bottome of Iustice Shallow.
How subiect wee old men are to this vice of Lying?
This same staru'd Iustice hath done nothing but
prate to me of the wildenesse of his Youth, and the
Feates hee hath done about Turnball-street, and euery
third word a Lye, duer pay'd to the hearer, then the
Turkes Tribute. I doe remember him at Clements Inne,
like a man made after Supper, of a Cheese-paring. When
hee was naked, hee was, for all the world, like a forked
Radish, with a Head fantastically caru'd vpon it with a
Knife. Hee was so forlorne, that his Dimensions (to
any thicke sight) were inuincible. Hee was the very
Genius of Famine: hee came euer in the rere-ward of
the Fashion: And now is this Vices Dagger become a
Squire, and talkes as familiarly of Iohn of Gaunt, as if
hee had beene sworne Brother to him: and Ile be sworne
hee neuer saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he
burst his Head, for crowding among the Marshals men.
I saw it, and told Iohn of Gaunt, hee beat his owne
Name, for you might haue truss'd him and all his Apparrell
into an Eele-skinne: the Case of a Treble Hoeboy
was a Mansion for him: a Court: and now hath
hee Land, and Beeues. Well, I will be acquainted with
him, if I returne: and it shall goe hard, but I will make
him a Philosophers two Stones to me. If the young
Dace be a Bayt for the old Pike, I see no reason, in the
Law of Nature, but I may snap at him. Let time shape,
and there an end.</p><br>

<p id="id12794">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id12795" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.</p><br>

<p id="id12796">Enter the Arch-bishop, Mowbray, Hastings, Westmerland,<br>

Coleuile.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12797">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. What is this Forrest call'd?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. 'Tis Gaultree Forrest, and't shall please your<br>

Grace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12798">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Here stand (my Lords) and send discouerers forth,<br>

To know the numbers of our Enemies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12799"> Hast. Wee haue sent forth alreadie</p><br>

<p id="id12800">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. 'Tis well done.<br>

My Friends, and Brethren (in these great Affaires)<br>

I must acquaint you, that I haue receiu'd<br>

New-dated Letters from Northumberland:<br>

Their cold intent, tenure, and substance thus.<br>

Here doth hee wish his Person, with such Powers<br>

As might hold sortance with his Qualitie,<br>

The which hee could not leuie: whereupon<br>

Hee is retyr'd, to ripe his growing Fortunes,<br>

To Scotland; and concludes in heartie prayers,<br>

That your Attempts may ouer-liue the hazard,<br>

And fearefull meeting of their Opposite<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12801">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Thus do the hopes we haue in him, touch ground,<br>

And dash themselues to pieces.<br>

Enter a Messenger.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12802">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Now? what newes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mess. West of this Forrest, scarcely off a mile,<br>

In goodly forme, comes on the Enemie:<br>

And by the ground they hide, I iudge their number<br>

Vpon, or neere, the rate of thirtie thousand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12803">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. The iust proportion that we gaue them out.<br>

Let vs sway-on, and face them in the field.<br>

Enter Westmerland.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12804">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. What well-appointed Leader fronts vs here?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. I thinke it is my Lord of Westmerland<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12805">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Health, and faire greeting from our Generall,<br>

The Prince, Lord Iohn, and Duke of Lancaster<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12806">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Say on (my Lord of Westmerland) in peace:<br>

What doth concerne your comming?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Then (my Lord)<br>

Vnto your Grace doe I in chiefe addresse<br>

The substance of my Speech. If that Rebellion<br>

Came like it selfe, in base and abiect Routs,<br>

Led on by bloodie Youth, guarded with Rage,<br>

And countenanc'd by Boyes, and Beggerie:<br>

I say, if damn'd Commotion so appeare,<br>

In his true, natiue, and most proper shape,<br>

You (Reuerend Father, and these Noble Lords)<br>

Had not beene here, to dresse the ougly forme<br>

Of base, and bloodie Insurrection,<br>

With your faire Honors. You, Lord Arch-bishop,<br>

Whose Sea is by a Ciuill Peace maintain'd,<br>

Whose Beard, the Siluer Hand of Peace hath touch'd,<br>

Whose Learning, and good Letters, Peace hath tutor'd,<br>

Whose white Inuestments figure Innocence,<br>

The Doue, and very blessed Spirit of Peace.<br>

Wherefore doe you so ill translate your selfe,<br>

Out of the Speech of Peace, that beares such grace,<br>

Into the harsh and boystrous Tongue of Warre?<br>

Turning your Bookes to Graues, your Inke to Blood,<br>

Your Pennes to Launces, and your Tongue diuine<br>

To a lowd Trumpet, and a Point of Warre<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12807">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Wherefore doe I this? so the Question stands.<br>

Briefely to this end: Wee are all diseas'd,<br>

And with our surfetting, and wanton howres,<br>

Haue brought our selues into a burning Feuer,<br>

And wee must bleede for it: of which Disease,<br>

Our late King Richard (being infected) dy'd.<br>

But (my most Noble Lord of Westmerland)<br>

I take not on me here as a Physician,<br>

Nor doe I, as an Enemie to Peace,<br>

Troope in the Throngs of Militarie men:<br>

But rather shew a while like fearefull Warre,<br>

To dyet ranke Mindes, sicke of happinesse,<br>

And purge th' obstructions, which begin to stop<br>

Our very Veines of Life: heare me more plainely.<br>

I haue in equall ballance iustly weigh'd,<br>

What wrongs our Arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,<br>

And finde our Griefes heauier then our Offences.<br>

Wee see which way the streame of Time doth runne,<br>

And are enforc'd from our most quiet there,<br>

By the rough Torrent of Occasion,<br>

And haue the summarie of all our Griefes<br>

(When time shall serue) to shew in Articles;<br>

Which long ere this, wee offer'd to the King,<br>

And might, by no Suit, gayne our Audience:<br>

When wee are wrong'd, and would vnfold our Griefes,<br>

Wee are deny'd accesse vnto his Person,<br>

Euen by those men, that most haue done vs wrong.<br>

The dangers of the dayes but newly gone,<br>

Whose memorie is written on the Earth<br>

With yet appearing blood; and the examples<br>

Of euery Minutes instance (present now)<br>

Hath put vs in these ill-beseeming Armes:<br>

Not to breake Peace, or any Branch of it,<br>

But to establish here a Peace indeede,<br>

Concurring both in Name and Qualitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12808">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. When euer yet was your Appeale deny'd?<br>

Wherein haue you beene galled by the King?<br>

What Peere hath beene suborn'd, to grate on you,<br>

That you should seale this lawlesse bloody Booke<br>

Of forg'd Rebellion, with a Seale diuine?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. My Brother generall, the Common-wealth,<br>

I make my Quarrell, in particular<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12809">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. There is no neede of any such redresse:<br>

Or if there were, it not belongs to you<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12810">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Why not to him in part, and to vs all,<br>

That feele the bruizes of the dayes before,<br>

And suffer the Condition of these Times<br>

To lay a heauie and vnequall Hand vpon our Honors?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;West. O my good Lord Mowbray,<br>

Construe the Times to their Necessities,<br>

And you shall say (indeede) it is the Time,<br>

And not the King, that doth you iniuries.<br>

Yet for your part, it not appeares to me,<br>

Either from the King, or in the present Time,<br>

That you should haue an ynch of any ground<br>

To build a Griefe on: were you not restor'd<br>

To all the Duke of Norfolkes Seignories,<br>

Your Noble, and right well-remembred Fathers?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. What thing, in Honor, had my Father lost,<br>

That need to be reuiu'd, and breath'd in me?<br>

The King that lou'd him, as the State stood then,<br>

Was forc'd, perforce compell'd to banish him:<br>

And then, that Henry Bullingbrooke and hee<br>

Being mounted, and both rowsed in their Seates,<br>

Their neighing Coursers daring of the Spurre,<br>

Their armed Staues in charge, their Beauers downe,<br>

Their eyes of fire, sparkling through sights of Steele,<br>

And the lowd Trumpet blowing them together:<br>

Then, then, when there was nothing could haue stay'd<br>

My Father from the Breast of Bullingbrooke;<br>

O, when the King did throw his Warder downe,<br>

(His owne Life hung vpon the Staffe hee threw)<br>

Then threw hee downe himselfe, and all their Liues,<br>

That by Indictment, and by dint of Sword,<br>

Haue since mis-carryed vnder Bullingbrooke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12811">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. You speak (Lord Mowbray) now you know not what.<br>

The Earle of Hereford was reputed then<br>

In England the most valiant Gentleman.<br>

Who knowes, on whom Fortune would then haue smil'd?<br>

But if your Father had beene Victor there,<br>

Hee ne're had borne it out of Couentry.<br>

For all the Countrey, in a generall voyce,<br>

Cry'd hate vpon him: and all their prayers, and loue,<br>

Were set on Herford, whom they doted on,<br>

And bless'd, and grac'd, and did more then the King.<br>

But this is meere digression from my purpose.<br>

Here come I from our Princely Generall,<br>

To know your Griefes; to tell you, from his Grace,<br>

That hee will giue you Audience: and wherein<br>

It shall appeare, that your demands are iust,<br>

You shall enioy them, euery thing set off,<br>

That might so much as thinke you Enemies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12812">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. But hee hath forc'd vs to compell this Offer,<br>

And it proceedes from Pollicy, not Loue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12813">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Mowbray, you ouer-weene to take it so:<br>

This Offer comes from Mercy, not from Feare.<br>

For loe, within a Ken our Army lyes,<br>

Vpon mine Honor, all too confident<br>

To giue admittance to a thought of feare.<br>

Our Battaile is more full of Names then yours,<br>

Our Men more perfect in the vse of Armes,<br>

Our Armor all as strong, our Cause the best;<br>

Then Reason will, our hearts should be as good.<br>

Say you not then, our Offer is compell'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12814"> Mow. Well, by my will, wee shall admit no Parley</p><br>

<p id="id12815">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. That argues but the shame of your offence:<br>

A rotten Case abides no handling<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12816">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Hath the Prince Iohn a full Commission,<br>

In very ample vertue of his Father,<br>

To heare, and absolutely to determine<br>

Of what Conditions wee shall stand vpon?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;West. That is intended in the Generals Name:<br>

I muse you make so slight a Question<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12817">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Then take (my Lord of Westmerland) this Schedule,<br>

For this containes our generall Grieuances:<br>

Each seuerall Article herein redress'd,<br>

All members of our Cause, both here, and hence,<br>

That are insinewed to this Action,<br>

Acquitted by a true substantiall forme,<br>

And present execution of our wills,<br>

To vs, and to our purposes confin'd,<br>

Wee come within our awfull Banks againe,<br>

And knit our Powers to the Arme of Peace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12818">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. This will I shew the Generall. Please you Lords,<br>

In sight of both our Battailes, wee may meete<br>

At either end in peace: which Heauen so frame,<br>

Or to the place of difference call the Swords,<br>

Which must decide it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12819"> Bish. My Lord, wee will doe so</p><br>

<p id="id12820">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. There is a thing within my Bosome tells me,<br>

That no Conditions of our Peace can stand<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12821">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Feare you not, that if wee can make our Peace<br>

Vpon such large termes, and so absolute,<br>

As our Conditions shall consist vpon,<br>

Our Peace shall stand as firme as Rockie Mountaines<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12822">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. I, but our valuation shall be such,<br>

That euery slight, and false-deriued Cause,<br>

Yea, euery idle, nice, and wanton Reason,<br>

Shall, to the King, taste of this Action:<br>

That were our Royall faiths, Martyrs in Loue,<br>

Wee shall be winnowed with so rough a winde,<br>

That euen our Corne shall seeme as light as Chaffe,<br>

And good from bad finde no partition<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12823">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. No, no (my Lord) note this: the King is wearie<br>

Of daintie, and such picking Grieuances:<br>

For hee hath found, to end one doubt by Death,<br>

Reuiues two greater in the Heires of Life.<br>

And therefore will hee wipe his Tables cleane,<br>

And keepe no Tell-tale to his Memorie,<br>

That may repeat, and Historie his losse,<br>

To new remembrance. For full well hee knowes,<br>

Hee cannot so precisely weede this Land,<br>

As his mis-doubts present occasion:<br>

His foes are so en-rooted with his friends,<br>

That plucking to vnfixe an Enemie,<br>

Hee doth vnfasten so, and shake a friend.<br>

So that this Land, like an offensiue wife,<br>

That hath enrag'd him on, to offer strokes,<br>

As he is striking, holds his Infant vp,<br>

And hangs resolu'd Correction in the Arme,<br>

That was vprear'd to execution<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12824">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Besides, the King hath wasted all his Rods,<br>

On late Offenders, that he now doth lacke<br>

The very Instruments of Chasticement:<br>

So that his power, like to a Fanglesse Lion<br>

May offer, but not hold<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12825">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. 'Tis very true:<br>

And therefore be assur'd (my good Lord Marshal)<br>

If we do now make our attonement well,<br>

Our Peace, will (like a broken Limbe vnited)<br>

Grow stronger, for the breaking<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12826">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Be it so:<br>

Heere is return'd my Lord of Westmerland.<br>

Enter Westmerland.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12827">&nbsp;&nbsp;West. The Prince is here at hand: pleaseth your Lordship<br>

To meet his Grace, iust distance 'tweene our Armies?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Your Grace of Yorke, in heauen's name then<br>

forward<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12828">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Before, and greet his Grace (my Lord) we come.<br>

Enter Prince Iohn.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12829">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. You are wel encountred here (my cosin Mowbray)<br>

Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,<br>

And so to you Lord Hastings, and to all.<br>

My Lord of Yorke, it better shew'd with you,<br>

When that your Flocke (assembled by the Bell)<br>

Encircled you, to heare with reuerence<br>

Your exposition on the holy Text,<br>

Then now to see you heere an Iron man<br>

Chearing a rowt of Rebels with your Drumme,<br>

Turning the Word, to Sword; and Life to death:<br>

That man that sits within a Monarches heart,<br>

And ripens in the Sunne-shine of his fauor,<br>

Would hee abuse the Countenance of the King,<br>

Alack, what Mischiefes might hee set abroach,<br>

In shadow of such Greatnesse? With you, Lord Bishop,<br>

It is euen so. Who hath not heard it spoken,<br>

How deepe you were within the Bookes of Heauen?<br>

To vs, the Speaker in his Parliament;<br>

To vs, th' imagine Voyce of Heauen it selfe:<br>

The very Opener, and Intelligencer,<br>

Betweene the Grace, the Sanctities of Heauen;<br>

And our dull workings. O, who shall beleeue,<br>

But you mis-vse the reuerence of your Place,<br>

Employ the Countenance, and Grace of Heauen,<br>

As a false Fauorite doth his Princes Name,<br>

In deedes dis-honorable? You haue taken vp,<br>

Vnder the counterfeited Zeale of Heauen,<br>

The Subiects of Heauens Substitute, my Father,<br>

And both against the Peace of Heauen, and him,<br>

Haue here vp-swarmed them<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12830">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Good my Lord of Lancaster,<br>

I am not here against your Fathers Peace:<br>

But (as I told my Lord of Westmerland)<br>

The Time (mis-order'd) doth in common sence<br>

Crowd vs, and crush vs, to this monstrous Forme,<br>

To hold our safetie vp. I sent your Grace<br>

The parcels, and particulars of our Griefe,<br>

The which hath been with scorne shou'd from the Court:<br>

Whereon this Hydra-Sonne of Warre is borne,<br>

Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleepe,<br>

With graunt of our most iust and right desires;<br>

And true Obedience, of this Madnesse cur'd,<br>

Stoope tamely to the foot of Maiestie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12831">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. If not, wee readie are to trye our fortunes,<br>

To the last man<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12832">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. And though wee here fall downe,<br>

Wee haue Supplyes, to second our Attempt:<br>

If they mis-carry, theirs shall second them.<br>

And so, successe of Mischiefe shall be borne,<br>

And Heire from Heire shall hold this Quarrell vp,<br>

Whiles England shall haue generation<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12833">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. You are too shallow (Hastings)<br>

Much too shallow,<br>

To sound the bottome of the after-Times<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12834">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Pleaseth your Grace, to answere them directly,<br>

How farre-forth you doe like their Articles<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12835">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I like them all, and doe allow them well:<br>

And sweare here, by the honor of my blood,<br>

My Fathers purposes haue beene mistooke,<br>

And some, about him, haue too lauishly<br>

Wrested his meaning, and Authoritie.<br>

My Lord, these Griefes shall be with speed redrest:<br>

Vpon my Life, they shall. If this may please you,<br>

Discharge your Powers vnto their seuerall Counties,<br>

As wee will ours: and here, betweene the Armies,<br>

Let's drinke together friendly, and embrace,<br>

That all their eyes may beare those Tokens home,<br>

Of our restored Loue, and Amitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12836"> Bish. I take your Princely word, for these redresses</p><br>

<p id="id12837">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I giue it you, and will maintaine my word:<br>

And thereupon I drinke vnto your Grace<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12838">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Goe Captaine, and deliuer to the Armie<br>

This newes of Peace: let them haue pay, and part:<br>

I know, it will well please them.<br>

High thee Captaine.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12839"> Bish. To you, my Noble Lord of Westmerland</p><br>

<p id="id12840">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. I pledge your Grace:<br>

And if you knew what paines I haue bestow'd,<br>

To breede this present Peace,<br>

You would drinke freely: but my loue to ye,<br>

Shall shew it selfe more openly hereafter<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12841"> Bish. I doe not doubt you</p><br>

<p id="id12842">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. I am glad of it.<br>

Health to my Lord, and gentle Cousin Mowbray<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12843">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. You wish me health in very happy season,<br>

For I am, on the sodaine, something ill<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12844">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Against ill Chances, men are euer merry,<br>

But heauinesse fore-runnes the good euent<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12845">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Therefore be merry (Cooze) since sodaine sorrow<br>

Serues to say thus: some good thing comes to morrow<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12846"> Bish. Beleeue me, I am passing light in spirit</p><br>

<p id="id12847"> Mow. So much the worse, if your owne Rule be true</p><br>

<p id="id12848" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Iohn. The word of Peace is render'd: hearke how
they showt</p><br>

<p id="id12849"> Mow. This had been chearefull, after Victorie</p><br>

<p id="id12850">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. A Peace is of the nature of a Conquest:<br>

For then both parties nobly are subdu'd,<br>

And neither partie looser<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12851">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Goe (my Lord)<br>

And let our Army be discharged too:<br>

And good my Lord (so please you) let our Traines<br>

March by vs, that wee may peruse the men<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12852">Wee should haue coap'd withall</p><br>

<p id="id12853">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Goe, good Lord Hastings:<br>

And ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12854">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I trust (Lords) wee shall lye to night together.<br>

Enter Westmerland.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12855">Now Cousin, wherefore stands our Army still?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;West. The Leaders hauing charge from you to stand,<br>

Will not goe off, vntill they heare you speake<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12856">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. They know their duties.<br>

Enter Hastings.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12857">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast. Our Army is dispers'd:<br>

Like youthfull Steeres, vnyoak'd, they tooke their course<br>

East, West, North, South: or like a Schoole, broke vp,<br>

Each hurryes towards his home, and sporting place<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12858">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Good tidings (my Lord Hastings) for the which,<br>

I doe arrest thee (Traytor) of high Treason:<br>

And you Lord Arch-bishop, and you Lord Mowbray,<br>

Of Capitall Treason, I attach you both<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12859">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mow. Is this proceeding iust, and honorable?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Is your Assembly so?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Will you thus breake your faith?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. I pawn'd thee none:<br>

I promis'd you redresse of these same Grieuances<br>

Whereof you did complaine; which, by mine Honor,<br>

I will performe, with a most Christian care.<br>

But for you (Rebels) looke to taste the due<br>

Meet for Rebellion, and such Acts as yours.<br>

Most shallowly did you these Armes commence,<br>

Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.<br>

Strike vp our Drummes, pursue the scatter'd stray,<br>

Heauen, and not wee, haue safely fought to day.<br>

Some guard these Traitors to the Block of Death,<br>

Treasons true Bed, and yeelder vp of breath.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12860">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id12861">Enter Falstaffe and Colleuile.</p><br>

<p id="id12862">&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. What's your Name, Sir? of what Condition are<br>

you? and of what place, I pray?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. I am a Knight, Sir:<br>

And my Name is Colleuile of the Dale<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12863"> Falst. Well then, Colleuile is your Name, a Knight is
your Degree, and your Place, the Dale. Colleuile shall
still be your Name, a Traytor your Degree, and the Dungeon
your Place, a place deepe enough: so shall you be
still Colleuile of the Dale</p><br>

<p id="id12864"> Col. Are not you Sir Iohn Falstaffe?
 Falst. As good a man as he sir, who ere I am: doe yee
yeelde sir, or shall I sweate for you? if I doe sweate, they
are the drops of thy Louers, and they weep for thy death,
therefore rowze vp Feare and Trembling, and do obseruance
to my mercy</p><br>

<p id="id12865" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Col. I thinke you are Sir Iohn Falstaffe, &amp; in that thought
yeeld me</p><br>

mine, and not a Tongue of them all, speakes anie other
word but my name: and I had but a belly of any indifferencie,
I were simply the most actiue fellow in Europe:

comes our Generall.
Enter Prince Iohn, and Westmerland.</p><br>

<p id="id12867">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. The heat is past, follow no farther now:<br>

Call in the Powers, good Cousin Westmerland.<br>

Now Falstaffe, where haue you beene all this while?<br>

When euery thing is ended, then you come.<br>

These tardie Tricks of yours will (on my life)<br>

One time, or other, breake some Gallowes back<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12868"> Falst. I would bee sorry (my Lord) but it should bee
thus: I neuer knew yet, but rebuke and checke was the
reward of Valour. Doe you thinke me a Swallow, an Arrow,
or a Bullet? Haue I, in my poore and olde Motion,
the expedition of Thought? I haue speeded hither with
the very extremest ynch of possibilitie. I haue fowndred
nine score and odde Postes: and heere (trauell-tainted
as I am) haue, in my pure and immaculate Valour, taken
Sir Iohn Colleuile of the Dale, a most furious Knight, and
valorous Enemie: But what of that? hee saw mee, and
yeelded: that I may iustly say with the hooke-nos'd
fellow of Rome, I came, saw, and ouer-came</p><br>

<p id="id12869"> Iohn. It was more of his Courtesie, then your deseruing</p><br>

<p id="id12870"> Falst. I know not: heere hee is, and heere I yeeld
him: and I beseech your Grace, let it be book'd, with
the rest of this dayes deedes; or I sweare, I will haue it
in a particular Ballad, with mine owne Picture on the top
of it (Colleuile kissing my foot:) To the which course, if
I be enforc'd, if you do not all shew like gilt two-pences
to me; and I, in the cleare Skie of Fame, o're-shine you
as much as the Full Moone doth the Cynders of the Element
(which shew like Pinnes-heads to her) beleeue not
the Word of the Noble: therefore let mee haue right,
and let desert mount</p><br>

<p id="id12871"> Iohn. Thine's too heauie to mount</p><br>

<p id="id12872"> Falst. Let it shine then</p><br>

<p id="id12873"> Iohn. Thine's too thick to shine</p><br>

<p id="id12874">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. Let it doe something (my good Lord) that may<br>

doe me good, and call it what you will<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12875">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Is thy Name Colleuile?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. It is (my Lord.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. A famous Rebell art thou, Colleuile<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12876"> Falst. And a famous true Subiect tooke him</p><br>

<p id="id12877">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. I am (my Lord) but as my Betters are,<br>

That led me hither: had they beene rul'd by me,<br>

You should haue wonne them dearer then you haue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12878">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falst. I know not how they sold themselues, but thou<br>

like a kinde fellow, gau'st thy selfe away; and I thanke<br>

thee, for thee.<br>

Enter Westmerland.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12879">&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Haue you left pursuit?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;West. Retreat is made, and Execution stay'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12880">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Send Colleuile, with his Confederates,<br>

To Yorke, to present Execution.<br>

Blunt, leade him hence, and see you guard him sure.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12881">Exit with Colleuile.</p><br>

<p id="id12882">And now dispatch we toward the Court (my Lords)<br>

I heare the King, my Father, is sore sicke.<br>

Our Newes shall goe before vs, to his Maiestie,<br>

And wee with sober speede will follow you<br>

<p id="id12883"> Falst. My Lord, I beseech you, giue me leaue to goe
through Gloucestershire: and when you come to Court,
stand my good Lord, 'pray, in your good report</p><br>

<p id="id12884">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Fare you well, Falstaffe: I, in my condition,<br>

Shall better speake of you, then you deserue.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12885"> Falst. I would you had but the wit: 'twere better
then your Dukedome. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded
Boy doth not loue me, nor a man cannot
make him laugh: but that's no maruaile, hee drinkes no
Wine. There's neuer any of these demure Boyes come
to any proofe: for thinne Drinke doth so ouer-coole
their blood, and making many Fish-Meales, that they
fall into a kinde of Male Greene-sicknesse: and then,
when they marry, they get Wenches. They are generally
Fooles, and Cowards; which some of vs should be too,
but for inflamation. A good Sherris-Sack hath a two-fold
operation in it: it ascends me into the Braine, dryes
me there all the foolish, and dull, and cruddie Vapours,
which enuiron it: makes it apprehensiue, quicke, forgetiue,
full of nimble, fierie, and delectable shapes; which
deliuer'd o're to the Voyce, the Tongue, which is the
Birth, becomes excellent Wit. The second propertie of
your excellent Sherris, is, the warming of the Blood:
which before (cold, and setled) left the Liuer white, and
pale; which is the Badge of Pusillanimitie, and Cowardize:
but the Sherris warmes it, and makes it course
from the inwards, to the parts extremes: it illuminateth
the Face, which (as a Beacon) giues warning to all the
rest of this little Kingdome (Man) to Arme: and then
the Vitall Commoners, and in-land pettie Spirits, muster
me all to their Captaine, the Heart; who great, and pufft
vp with his Retinue, doth any Deed of Courage: and this
Valour comes of Sherris. So, that skill in the Weapon
is nothing, without Sack (for that sets it a-worke:) and
Learning, a meere Hoord of Gold, kept by a Deuill, till
Sack commences it, and sets it in act, and vse. Hereof
comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant: for the cold blood
hee did naturally inherite of his Father, hee hath, like
leane, stirrill, and bare Land, manured, husbanded, and
tyll'd, with excellent endeauour of drinking good, and
good store of fertile Sherris, that hee is become very hot,
and valiant. If I had a thousand Sonnes, the first Principle
I would teach them, should be to forsweare thinne Potations,
and to addict themselues to Sack.
Enter Bardolph.</p><br>

<p id="id12886">How now Bardolph?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bard. The Armie is discharged all, and gone<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12887"> Falst. Let them goe: Ile through Gloucestershire,
and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire: I
haue him alreadie tempering betweene my finger and my
thombe, and shortly will I seale with him. Come away.</p><br>

<p id="id12888">Exeunt.</p><br>

<p id="id12889" style="margin-top: 2em">Scena Secunda.</p><br>

<p id="id12890">Enter King, Warwicke, Clarence, Gloucester.</p><br>

<p id="id12891">&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Now Lords, if Heauen doth giue successefull end<br>

To this Debate, that bleedeth at our doores,<br>

Wee will our Youth lead on to higher Fields,<br>

And draw no Swords, but what are sanctify'd.<br>

Our Nauie is addressed, our Power collected,<br>

Our Substitutes, in absence, well inuested,<br>

And euery thing lyes leuell to our wish;<br>

<p id="id12893">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Humphrey (my Sonne of Gloucester) where is<br>

the Prince, your Brother?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glo. I thinke hee's gone to hunt (my Lord) at Windsor<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12894">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. And how accompanied?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glo. I doe not know (my Lord.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Is not his Brother, Thomas of Clarence, with<br>

him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glo. No (my good Lord) hee is in presence heere<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12895">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clar. What would my Lord, and Father?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.<br>

How chance thou art not with the Prince, thy Brother?<br>

Hee loues thee, and thou do'st neglect him (Thomas.)<br>

Thou hast a better place in his Affection,<br>

Then all thy Brothers: cherish it (my Boy)<br>

And Noble Offices thou may'st effect<br>

Of Mediation (after I am dead)<br>

Betweene his Greatnesse, and thy other Brethren.<br>

Therefore omit him not: blunt not his Loue,<br>

Nor loose the good aduantage of his Grace,<br>

By seeming cold, or carelesse of his will.<br>

For hee is gracious, if hee be obseru'd:<br>

Hee hath a Teare for Pitie, and a Hand<br>

Open (as Day) for melting Charitie:<br>

Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, hee's Flint,<br>

As humorous as Winter, and as sudden,<br>

As Flawes congealed in the Spring of day.<br>

His temper therefore must be well obseru'd:<br>

Chide him for faults, and doe it reuerently,<br>

When you perceiue his blood enclin'd to mirth:<br>

But being moodie, giue him Line, and scope,<br>

Till that his passions (like a Whale on ground)<br>

Confound themselues with working. Learne this Thomas,<br>

And thou shalt proue a shelter to thy friends,<br>

A Hoope of Gold, to binde thy Brothers in:<br>

That the vnited Vessell of their Blood<br>

(Mingled with Venome of Suggestion,<br>

As force, perforce, the Age will powre it in)<br>

Shall neuer leake, though it doe worke as strong<br>

As Aconitum, or rash Gun-powder<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12896"> Clar. I shall obserue him with all care, and loue</p><br>

<p id="id12897">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Why art thou not at Windsor with him (Thomas?)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clar. Hee is not there to day: hee dines in London<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12898">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. And how accompanyed? Canst thou tell<br>

that?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Clar. With Pointz, and other his continuall followers<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12899">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Most subiect is the fattest Soyle to Weedes:<br>

And hee (the Noble Image of my Youth)<br>

Is ouer-spread with them: therefore my griefe<br>

Stretches it selfe beyond the howre of death.<br>

The blood weepes from my heart, when I doe shape<br>

(In formes imaginarie) th' vnguided Dayes,<br>

And rotten Times, that you shall looke vpon,<br>

When I am sleeping with my Ancestors.<br>

For when his head-strong Riot hath no Curbe,<br>

When Rage and hot-Blood are his Counsailors,<br>

When Meanes and lauish Manners meete together;<br>

Oh, with what Wings shall his Affections flye<br>

Towards fronting Perill, and oppos'd Decay?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;War. My gracious Lord, you looke beyond him quite:<br>

The Prince but studies his Companions,<br>

Like a strange Tongue: wherein, to gaine the Language,<br>

'Tis needfull, that the most immodest word<br>

Be look'd vpon, and learn'd: which once attayn'd,<br>

Your Highnesse knowes, comes to no farther vse,<br>

But to be knowne, and hated. So, like grosse termes,<br>

The Prince will, in the perfectnesse of time,<br>

Cast off his followers: and their memorie<br>

Being so troublesome a Bed-fellow?<br>

O pollish'd Perturbation! Golden Care!<br>

That keep'st the Ports of Slumber open wide,<br>

To many a watchfull Night: sleepe with it now,<br>

Yet not so sound, and halfe so deepely sweete,<br>

As hee whose Brow (with homely Biggen bound)<br>

Snores out the Watch of Night. O Maiestie!<br>

When thou do'st pinch thy Bearer, thou do'st sit<br>

Like a rich Armor, worne in heat of day,<br>

That scald'st with safetie: by his Gates of breath,<br>

There lyes a dowlney feather, which stirres not:<br>

Did hee suspire, that light and weightlesse dowlne<br>

Perforce must moue. My gracious Lord, my Father,<br>

This sleepe is sound indeede: this is a sleepe,<br>

That from this Golden Rigoll hath diuorc'd<br>

So many English Kings. Thy due, from me,<br>

Is Teares, and heauie Sorrowes of the Blood,<br>

Which Nature, Loue, and filiall tendernesse,<br>

Shall (O deare Father) pay thee plenteously.<br>

My due, from thee, is this Imperiall Crowne,<br>

Which (as immediate from thy Place, and Blood)<br>

Deriues it selfe to me. Loe, heere it sits,<br>

Which Heauen shall guard:<br>

And put the worlds whole strength into one gyant Arme,<br>

It shall not force this Lineall Honor from me.<br>

My sleepe, my death? Finde him (my Lord of Warwick)<br>

Chide him hither: this part of his conioynes<br>

With my disease, and helpes to end me.<br>

See Sonnes, what things you are:<br>

How quickly Nature falls into reuolt,<br>

When Gold becomes her Obiect?<br>

For this, the foolish ouer-carefull Fathers<br>

Haue broke their sleepes with thoughts,<br>

Their braines with care, their bones with industry.<br>

For this, they haue ingrossed and pyl'd vp<br>

The canker'd heapes of strange-atchieued Gold:<br>

For this, they haue beene thoughtfull, to inuest<br>

Their Sonnes with Arts, and Martiall Exercises:<br>

When, like the Bee, culling from euery flower<br>

The vertuous Sweetes, our Thighes packt with Wax,<br>

Our Mouthes with Honey, wee bring it to the Hiue;<br>

And like the Bees, are murthered for our paines.<br>

<p id="id12936">Now, where is hee, that will not stay so long,<br>

Till his Friend Sicknesse hath determin'd me?<br>

Washing with kindly Teares his gentle Cheekes,<br>

With such a deepe demeanure, in great sorrow,<br>

That Tyranny, which neuer quafft but blood,<br>

Would (by beholding him) haue wash'd his Knife<br>

With gentle eye-drops. Hee is comming hither<br>

<p id="id12939"> P.Hen. I neuer thought to heare you speake againe</p><br>

<p id="id12940">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Thy wish was Father (Harry) to that thought:<br>

I stay too long by thee, I wearie thee.<br>

Do'st thou so hunger for my emptie Chayre,<br>

That thou wilt needes inuest thee with mine Honors,<br>

Before thy howre be ripe? O foolish Youth!<br>

Thou seek'st the Greatnesse, that will ouer-whelme thee.<br>

Stay but a little: for my Cloud of Dignitie<br>

Is held from falling, with so weake a winde,<br>

That it will quickly drop: my Day is dimme.<br>

Thou hast stolne that, which after some few howres<br>

Were thine, without offence: and at my death<br>

Thou hast seal'd vp my expectation.<br>

Thy Life did manifest, thou lou'dst me not,<br>

And thou wilt haue me dye assur'd of it.<br>

Thou hid'st a thousand Daggers in thy thoughts,<br>

Which thou hast whetted on thy stonie heart,<br>

To stab at halfe an howre of my Life.<br>

What? canst thou not forbeare me halfe an howre?<br>

Then get thee gone, and digge my graue thy selfe,<br>

And bid the merry Bels ring to thy eare<br>

That thou art Crowned, not that I am dead.<br>

Let all the Teares, that should bedew my Hearse<br>

Be drops of Balme, to sanctifie thy head:<br>

Onely compound me with forgotten dust.<br>

Giue that, which gaue thee life, vnto the Wormes:<br>

Plucke downe my Officers, breake my Decrees;<br>

For now a time is come, to mocke at Forme.<br>

Henry the fift is Crown'd: Vp Vanity,<br>

Downe Royall State: All you sage Counsailors, hence:<br>

And to the English Court, assemble now<br>

From eu'ry Region, Apes of Idlenesse.<br>

Now neighbor-Confines, purge you of your Scum:<br>

Haue you a Ruffian that will sweare? drinke? dance?<br>

Reuell the night? Rob? Murder? and commit<br>

The oldest sinnes, the newest kinde of wayes?<br>

Be happy, he will trouble you no more:<br>

England, shall double gill'd, his trebble guilt.<br>

England, shall giue him Office, Honor, Might:<br>

For the Fift Harry, from curb'd License pluckes<br>

The muzzle of Restraint; and the wilde Dogge<br>

Shall flesh his tooth in euery Innocent.<br>

O my poore Kingdome (sicke, with ciuill blowes)<br>

When that my Care could not with-hold thy Ryots,<br>

What wilt thou do, when Ryot is thy Care?<br>

O, thou wilt be a Wildernesse againe,<br>

Peopled with Wolues (thy old Inhabitants.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. O pardon me (my Liege)<br>

But for my Teares,<br>

The most Impediments vnto my Speech,<br>

I had fore-stall'd this deere, and deepe Rebuke,<br>

Ere you (with greefe) had spoke, and I had heard<br>

The course of it so farre. There is your Crowne,<br>

And he that weares the Crowne immortally,<br>

Long guard it yours. If I affect it more,<br>

Then as your Honour, and as your Renowne,<br>

Let me no more from this Obedience rise,<br>

Which my most true, and inward duteous Spirit<br>

Teacheth this prostrate, and exteriour bending.<br>

Heauen witnesse with me, when I heere came in,<br>

And found no course of breath within your Maiestie,<br>

How cold it strooke my heart. If I do faine,<br>

O let me, in my present wildenesse, dye,<br>

And neuer liue, to shew th' incredulous World,<br>

The Noble change that I haue purposed.<br>

Comming to looke on you, thinking you dead,<br>

(And dead almost (my Liege) to thinke you were)<br>

I spake vnto the Crowne (as hauing sense)<br>

And thus vpbraided it. The Care on thee depending,<br>

Hath fed vpon the body of my Father,<br>

Therefore, thou best of Gold, art worst of Gold.<br>

Other, lesse fine in Charract, is more precious,<br>

Preseruing life, in Med'cine potable:<br>

But thou, most Fine, most Honour'd, most Renown'd,<br>

Hast eate the Bearer vp.<br>

Thus (my Royall Liege)<br>

Accusing it, I put it on my Head,<br>

To try with it (as with an Enemie,<br>

That had before my face murdred my Father)<br>

The Quarrell of a true Inheritor.<br>

But if it did infect my blood with Ioy,<br>

Or swell my Thoughts, to any straine of Pride,<br>

If any Rebell, or vaine spirit of mine,<br>

Did, with the least Affection of a Welcome,<br>

Giue entertainment to the might of it,<br>

Let heauen, for euer, keepe it from my head,<br>

And make me, as the poorest Vassaile is,<br>

That doth with awe, and terror kneele to it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12941">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. O my Sonne!<br>

Heauen put it in thy minde to take it hence,<br>

That thou might'st ioyne the more, thy Fathers loue,<br>

Pleading so wisely, in excuse of it.<br>

Come hither Harrie, sit thou by my bedde,<br>

And heare (I thinke, the very latest Counsell<br>

That euer I shall breath: Heauen knowes, my Sonne)<br>

By what by-pathes, and indirect crook'd-wayes<br>

I met this Crowne: and I my selfe know well<br>

How troublesome it sate vpon my head.<br>

To thee, it shall descend with better Quiet,<br>

Better Opinion, better Confirmation:<br>

For all the soyle of the Atchieuement goes<br>

With me, into the Earth. It seem'd in mee,<br>

But as an Honour snatch'd with boyst'rous hand,<br>

And I had many liuing, to vpbraide<br>

My gaine of it, by their Assistances,<br>

Which dayly grew to Quarrell, and to Blood-shed,<br>

Wounding supposed Peace.<br>

All these bold Feares,<br>

Thou seest (with perill) I haue answered:<br>

For all my Reigne, hath beene but as a Scene<br>

Acting that argument. And now my death<br>

Changes the Moode: For what in me, was purchas'd,<br>

Falles vpon thee, in a more Fayrer sort.<br>

So thou, the Garland wear'st successiuely.<br>

Yet, though thou stand'st more sure, then I could do,<br>

Thou art not firme enough, since greefes are greene:<br>

And all thy Friends, which thou must make thy Friends<br>

Haue but their stings, and teeth, newly tak'n out,<br>

By whose fell working, I was first aduanc'd,<br>

And by whose power, I well might lodge a Feare<br>

To be againe displac'd. Which to auoyd,<br>

I cut them off: and had a purpose now<br>

To leade out many to the Holy Land;<br>

Least rest, and lying still, might make them looke<br>

Too neere vnto my State.<br>

Therefore (my Harrie)<br>

Be it thy course to busie giddy Mindes<br>

With Forraigne Quarrels: that Action hence borne out,<br>

May waste the memory of the former dayes.<br>

More would I, but my Lungs are wasted so,<br>

That strength of Speech it vtterly deni'de mee.<br>

How I came by the Crowne, O heauen forgiue:<br>

And grant it may, with thee, in true peace liue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12942">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. My gracious Liege:<br>

You wonne it, wore it: kept it, gaue it me,<br>

Then plaine and right must my possession be;<br>

Which I, with more, then with a Common paine,<br>

'Gainst all the World, will rightfully maintaine.<br>

Enter Lord Iohn of Lancaster, and Warwicke.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12943">&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Looke, looke,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iohn. Health, Peace, and Happinesse,<br>

To my Royall Father<br>

<p id="id12944">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Thou bring'st me happinesse and Peace<br>

(Sonne Iohn:)<br>

But health (alacke) with youthfull wings is flowne<br>

From this bare, wither'd Trunke. Vpon thy sight<br>

My worldly businesse makes a period.<br>

Where is my Lord of Warwicke?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. My Lord of Warwicke<br>

Euen there my life must end.<br>

It hath beene prophesi'de to me many yeares,<br>

I should not dye, but in Ierusalem:<br>

Which (vainly) I suppos'd the Holy-Land.<br>

But beare me to that Chamber, there Ile lye:<br>

In that Ierusalem, shall Harry dye.<br>

Bardolfe, looke to our Horsses. If I were saw'de into
Quantities, I should make foure dozen of such bearded
Hermites staues, as Master Shallow. It is a wonderfull
thing to see the semblable Coherence of his mens spirits,
and his: They, by obseruing of him, do beare themselues
like foolish Iustices: Hee, by conuersing with them, is
turn'd into a Iustice-like Seruingman. Their spirits are
so married in Coniunction, with the participation of Society,
that they flocke together in consent, like so many
Wilde-Geese. If I had a suite to Mayster Shallow, I
would humour his men, with the imputation of beeing
neere their Mayster. If to his Men, I would currie with
Maister Shallow, that no man could better command his
Seruants. It is certaine, that either wise bearing, or ignorant
Carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of
another: therefore, let men take heede of their Companie.
I will deuise matter enough out of this Shallow, to
keepe Prince Harry in continuall Laughter, the wearing
out of sixe Fashions (which is foure Tearmes) or two Actions,
and he shall laugh with Interuallums. O it is much
that a Lye (with a slight Oath) and a iest (with a sadde
brow) will doe, with a Fellow, that neuer had the Ache
in his shoulders. O you shall see him laugh, till his Face
be like a wet Cloake, ill laid vp</p><br>

And to our purposes, he liues no more<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12976">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. I would his Maiesty had call'd me with him,<br>

The seruice, that I truly did his life,<br>

Hath left me open to all iniuries<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12977"> War. Indeed I thinke the yong King loues you not</p><br>

<p id="id12978">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. I know he doth not, and do arme my selfe<br>

To welcome the condition of the Time,<br>

Which cannot looke more hideously vpon me,<br>

Then I haue drawne it in my fantasie.<br>

Enter Iohn of Lancaster, Gloucester, and Clarence.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12979">&nbsp;&nbsp;War. Heere come the heauy Issue of dead Harrie:<br>

O, that the liuing Harrie had the temper<br>

Of him, the worst of these three Gentlemen:<br>

How many Nobles then, should hold their places,<br>

That must strike saile, to Spirits of vilde sort?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. Alas, I feare, all will be ouer-turn'd<br>

And I dare sweare, you borrow not that face<br>

Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your owne<br>

<p id="id12987">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cla. Wel, you must now speake Sir Iohn Falstaffe faire,<br>

Which swimmes against your streame of Quality<br>

<p id="id12988">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. Sweet Princes: what I did, I did in Honor,<br>

Led by th' Imperiall Conduct of my Soule,<br>

And neuer shall you see, that I will begge<br>

A ragged, and fore-stall'd Remission.<br>

If Troth, and vpright Innocency fayle me,<br>

Ile to the King (my Master) that is dead,<br>

And tell him, who hath sent me after him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12989">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War. Heere comes the Prince.<br>

Enter Prince Henrie.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12990">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. Good morrow: and heauen saue your Maiesty<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince. This new, and gorgeous Garment, Maiesty,<br>

Sits not so easie on me, as you thinke.<br>

Brothers, you mixe your Sadnesse with some Feare:<br>

This is the English, not the Turkish Court:<br>

Not Amurah, an Amurah succeeds,<br>

But Harry, Harry: Yet be sad (good Brothers)<br>

For (to speake truth) it very well becomes you:<br>

Sorrow, so Royally in you appeares,<br>

That I will deeply put the Fashion on,<br>

And weare it in my heart. Why then be sad,<br>

But entertaine no more of it (good Brothers)<br>

Then a ioynt burthen, laid vpon vs all.<br>

For me, by Heauen (I bid you be assur'd)<br>

Ile be your Father, and your Brother too:<br>

Let me but beare your Loue, Ile beare your Cares;<br>

But weepe that Harrie's dead, and so will I.<br>

But Harry liues, that shall conuert those Teares<br>

By number, into houres of Happinesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12991"> Iohn, &amp;c. We hope no other from your Maiesty</p><br>

<p id="id12992">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. You all looke strangely on me: and you most,<br>

You are (I thinke) assur'd, I loue you not<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12993">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. I am assur'd (if I be measur'd rightly)<br>

Your Maiesty hath no iust cause to hate mee<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12994">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pr. No? How might a Prince of my great hopes forget<br>

So great Indignities you laid vpon me?<br>

What? Rate? Rebuke? and roughly send to Prison<br>

Th' immediate Heire of England? Was this easie?<br>

May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch.Iust. I then did vse the Person of your Father:<br>

The Image of his power, lay then in me,<br>

And in th' administration of his Law,<br>

Whiles I was busie for the Commonwealth,<br>

Your Highnesse pleased to forget my place,<br>

The Maiesty, and power of Law, and Iustice,<br>

The Image of the King, whom I presented,<br>

And strooke me in my very Seate of Iudgement:<br>

Whereon (as an Offender to your Father)<br>

I gaue bold way to my Authority,<br>

And did commit you. If the deed were ill,<br>

Be you contented, wearing now the Garland,<br>

To haue a Sonne, set your Decrees at naught?<br>

To plucke downe Iustice from your awefull Bench?<br>

To trip the course of Law, and blunt the Sword<br>

That guards the peace, and safety of your Person?<br>

Nay more, to spurne at your most Royall Image,<br>

And mocke your workings, in a Second body?<br>

Question your Royall Thoughts, make the case yours:<br>

Be now the Father, and propose a Sonne:<br>

Heare your owne dignity so much prophan'd,<br>

See your most dreadfull Lawes, so loosely slighted;<br>

Behold your selfe, so by a Sonne disdained:<br>

And then imagine me, taking your part,<br>

And in your power, soft silencing your Sonne:<br>

After this cold considerance, sentence me;<br>

And, as you are a King, speake in your State,<br>

What I haue done, that misbecame my place,<br>

My person, or my Lieges Soueraigntie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id12995">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. You are right Iustice, and you weigh this well:<br>

Therefore still beare the Ballance, and the Sword:<br>

And I do wish your Honors may encrease,<br>

Till you do liue, to see a Sonne of mine<br>

Offend you, and obey you, as I did.<br>

So shall I liue, to speake my Fathers words:<br>

Happy am I, that haue a man so bold,<br>

That dares do Iustice, on my proper Sonne;<br>

And no lesse happy, hauing such a Sonne,<br>

That would deliuer vp his Greatnesse so,<br>

Into the hands of Iustice. You did commit me:<br>

For which, I do commit into your hand,<br>

Th' vnstained Sword that you haue vs'd to beare:<br>

With this Remembrance; That you vse the same<br>

With the like bold, iust, and impartiall spirit<br>

As you haue done 'gainst me. There is my hand,<br>

You shall be as a Father, to my Youth:<br>

My voice shall sound, as you do prompt mine eare,<br>

And I will stoope, and humble my Intents,<br>

To your well-practis'd, wise Directions.<br>

And Princes all, beleeue me, I beseech you:<br>

My Father is gone wilde into his Graue,<br>

(For in his Tombe, lye my Affections)<br>

And with his Spirits, sadly I suruiue,<br>

To mocke the expectation of the World;<br>

To frustrate Prophesies, and to race out<br>

Rotten Opinion, who hath writ me downe<br>

After my seeming. The Tide of Blood in me,<br>

Hath prowdly flow'd in Vanity, till now.<br>

Now doth it turne, and ebbe backe to the Sea,<br>

Where it shall mingle with the state of Floods,<br>

And flow henceforth in formall Maiesty.<br>

Now call we our High Court of Parliament,<br>

And let vs choose such Limbes of Noble Counsaile,<br>

That the great Body of our State may go<br>

In equall ranke, with the best gouern'd Nation,<br>

That Warre, or Peace, or both at once may be<br>

As things acquainted and familiar to vs,<br>

In which you (Father) shall haue formost hand.<br>

Our Coronation done, we will accite<br>

(As I before remembred) all our State,<br>

And heauen (consigning to my good intents)<br>

No Prince, nor Peere, shall haue iust cause to say,<br>

Heauen shorten Harries happy life, one day.<br>

Presume not, that I am the thing I was,<br>

For heauen doth know (so shall the world perceiue)<br>

That I haue turn'd away my former Selfe,<br>

So will I those that kept me Companie.<br>

When thou dost heare I am, as I haue bin,<br>

Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou was't<br>

The Tutor and the Feeder of my Riots:<br>

Till then, I banish thee, on paine of death,<br>

As I haue done the rest of my Misleaders,<br>

Not to come neere our Person, by ten mile.<br>

For competence of life, I will allow you,<br>

That lacke of meanes enforce you not to euill:<br>

And as we heare you do reforme your selues,<br>

Giue you aduancement. Be it your charge (my Lord)<br>

The brightest Heauen of Inuention:<br>

A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act,<br>

And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene.<br>

Then should the Warlike Harry, like himselfe,<br>

Assume the Port of Mars, and at his heeles<br>

(Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire<br>

Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:<br>

The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd,<br>

On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth<br>

So great an Obiect. Can this Cock-Pit hold<br>

The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme<br>

Within this Woodden O, the very Caskes<br>

That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?<br>

O pardon: since a crooked Figure may<br>

Attest in little place a Million,<br>

And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt,<br>

On your imaginarie Forces worke.<br>

Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls<br>

Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies,<br>

Whose high, vp-reared, and abutting Fronts,<br>

The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder.<br>

Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:<br>

Into a thousand parts diuide one Man,<br>

And make imaginarie Puissance.<br>

Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them<br>

Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:<br>

For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings,<br>

Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;<br>

Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres<br>

Into an Howre-glasse: for the which supplie,<br>

Admit me Chorus to this Historie;<br>

Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign<br>

Was like, and had indeed against vs past,<br>

But that the scambling and vnquiet time<br>

Did push it out of farther question<br>

<p id="id13133">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,<br>

We loose the better halfe of our Possession:<br>

For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout<br>

By Testament haue giuen to the Church,<br>

Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,<br>

As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,<br>

Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,<br>

Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:<br>

And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age<br>

Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,<br>

A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd:<br>

And to the Coffers of the King beside,<br>

A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13137"> Bish.Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church</p><br>

<p id="id13138">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not.<br>

The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,<br>

But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,<br>

Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,<br>

Consideration like an Angell came,<br>

And whipt th' offending Adam out of him;<br>

Leauing his body as a Paradise,<br>

T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.<br>

Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:<br>

Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,<br>

With such a heady currance scowring faults:<br>

Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse<br>

So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;<br>

<p id="id13139"> Bish.Ely. We are blessed in the Change</p><br>

<p id="id13140">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;<br>

And all-admiring, with an inward wish<br>

You would desire the King were made a Prelate:<br>

Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;<br>

You would say, it hath been all in all his study:<br>

List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare<br>

A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.<br>

Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,<br>

The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,<br>

Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,<br>

The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,<br>

And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,<br>

To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:<br>

So that the Art and Practique part of Life,<br>

Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.<br>

Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,<br>

Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,<br>

His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,<br>

His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;<br>

And neuer noted in him any studie,<br>

Any retyrement, any sequestration,<br>

From open Haunts and Popularitie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13141">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,<br>

And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,<br>

Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:<br>

And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation<br>

Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)<br>

Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,<br>

Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie<br>
</p><br>

And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,<br>

How things are perfected<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13143">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. But my good Lord:<br>

How now for mittigation of this Bill,<br>

Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie<br>

Incline to it, or no?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. He seemes indifferent:<br>

Or rather swaying more vpon our part,<br>

Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:<br>

For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,<br>

Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,<br>

And in regard of Causes now in hand,<br>

Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,<br>

As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,<br>

Then euer at one time the Clergie yet<br>

Did to his Predecessors part withall<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13144">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie:<br>

Saue that there was not time enough to heare,<br>

As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,<br>

The seueralls and vnhidden passages<br>

Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,<br>

And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,<br>

Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant<br>

Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,<br>

To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. It is<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13146">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:<br>

Which I could with a ready guesse declare,<br>

Before the Frenchman speake a word of it<br>

Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,<br>

Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:<br>

And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,<br>

That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,<br>

Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,<br>

With opening Titles miscreate, whose right<br>

Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:<br>

For God doth know, how many now in health,<br>

Shall drop their blood, in approbation<br>

Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.<br>

Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,<br>

How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;<br>

Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops<br>

Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,<br>

'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,<br>

That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.<br>

Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:<br>

That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,<br>

As pure as sinne with Baptisme<br>

<p id="id13155">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, &amp; you Peers,<br>

That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,<br>

To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre<br>

To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,<br>

But this which they produce from Pharamond,<br>

In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,<br>

No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:<br>

Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze<br>

To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond<br>

The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.<br>

Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,<br>

That the Land Salike is in Germanie,<br>

Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:<br>

Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,<br>

There left behind and settled certaine French:<br>

Who holding in disdaine the German Women,<br>

For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>

Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female<br>

Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:<br>

Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,<br>

Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen.<br>

Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law<br>

Was not deuised for the Realme of France:<br>

Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land,<br>

Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres<br>

After defunction of King Pharamond,<br>

Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,<br>

Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,<br>

Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great<br>

Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>

Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere<br>

Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,<br>

King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,<br>

Did as Heire Generall, being descended<br>

Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,<br>

Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.<br>

Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne<br>

Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male<br>

Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:<br>

To find his Title with some shewes of truth,<br>

Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,<br>

Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare,<br>

Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne<br>

To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne<br>

Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,<br>

Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,<br>

Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,<br>

Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,<br>

That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,<br>

Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,<br>

Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:<br>

By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great<br>

Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.<br>

So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,<br>

King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,<br>

King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare<br>

To hold in Right and Title of the Female:<br>

So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.<br>

Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,<br>

To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,<br>

And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,<br>

Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,<br>

Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors<br>

And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;<br>

You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:<br>

The Blood and Courage that renowned them,<br>

Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege<br>

Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,<br>

Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13158">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth<br>

Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,<br>

As did the former Lyons of your Blood<br>

<p id="id13159">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;<br>

So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England<br>

Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,<br>

Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,<br>

And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege<br>

With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:<br>

In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie<br>

Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,<br>

As neuer did the Clergie at one time<br>

Bring in to any of your Ancestors<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13161">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,<br>

But lay downe our proportions, to defend<br>

Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,<br>

With all aduantages<br>
</p><br>

Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13164">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:<br>

For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,<br>

When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,<br>

And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,<br>

Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,<br>

But taken and impounded as a Stray,<br>

The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,<br>

To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,<br>

And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,<br>

As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea<br>

With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13165">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Ely. But there's a saying very old and true,<br>

If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.<br>

For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,<br>

To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)<br>

Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,<br>

Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,<br>

To tame and hauocke more then she can eate<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13166">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,<br>

Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,<br>

Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,<br>

And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.<br>

While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,<br>

Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:<br>

For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,<br>

Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,<br>

Congreeing in a full and natural close,<br>

Like Musicke<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13167">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide<br>

The state of man in diuers functions,<br>

Setting endeuour in continual motion:<br>

To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,<br>

Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,<br>

Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach<br>

The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.<br>

They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,<br>

Where some like Magistrates correct at home:<br>

Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:<br>

Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,<br>

Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:<br>

Which pillage, they with merry march bring home<br>

To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:<br>

Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes<br>

The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,<br>

The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;<br>

The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in<br>

Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:<br>

The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,<br>

Deliuering ore to Executors pale<br>

The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,<br>

That many things hauing full reference<br>

To one consent, may worke contrariously,<br>

As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes<br>

Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,<br>

As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;<br>

As many Lynes close in the Dials center:<br>

So may a thousand actions once a foote,<br>

And in one purpose, and be all well borne<br>

Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,<br>

Diuide your happy England into foure,<br>

Whereof, take you one quarter into France,<br>

And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.<br>

If we with thrice such powers left at home,<br>

Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,<br>

Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose<br>

The name of hardinesse and policie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13168">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.<br>

Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe<br>

And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,<br>

France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,<br>

Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,<br>

(Ruling in large and ample Emperie,<br>

Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)<br>

Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,<br>

Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:<br>

Either our History shall with full mouth<br>

Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue<br>

Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,<br>

Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.<br>

Enter Ambassadors of France.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13169">Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure<br>

Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,<br>

Your greeting is from him, not from the King<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13170">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amb. May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue<br>

Freely to render what we haue in charge:<br>

Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off<br>

The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13171">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,<br>

Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect<br>

As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,<br>

Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,<br>

Tell vs the Dolphins minde<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13172">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amb. Thus than in few:<br>

Your Highnesse lately sending into France,<br>

Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right<br>

Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third.<br>

In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master<br>

Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,<br>

And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,<br>

That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:<br>

You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.<br>

He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit<br>

This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,<br>

Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime<br>

Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13173">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. What Treasure Vncle?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Tennis balles, my Liege<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13174">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,<br>

His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:<br>

When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,<br>

We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,<br>

Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.<br>

Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,<br>

That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd<br>

With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,<br>

How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,<br>

Not measuring what vse we made of them.<br>

We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,<br>

And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe<br>

To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,<br>

That men are merriest, when they are from home.<br>

But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,<br>

Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,<br>

When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.<br>

For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,<br>

And plodded like a man for working dayes:<br>

But I will rise there with so full a glorie,<br>

That I will dazle all the eyes of France,<br>

Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,<br>

And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his<br>

Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule<br>

Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance<br>

That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows<br>

Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;<br>

Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:<br>

And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,<br>

That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.<br>

But this lyes all within the wil of God,<br>

To whom I do appeale, and in whose name<br>

Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,<br>

To venge me as I may, and to put forth<br>

My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause.<br>

So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,<br>

His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,<br>

When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.<br>

Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13175">Exeunt. Ambassadors.</p><br>

<p id="id13176"> Exe. This was a merry Message</p><br>

<p id="id13177">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We hope to make the Sender blush at it:<br>

Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre,<br>

That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition:<br>

For we haue now no thought in vs but France,<br>

Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse.<br>

Therefore let our proportions for these Warres<br>

Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon,<br>

That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde<br>

More Feathers to our Wings: for God before,<br>

Wee'le chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore.<br>

Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,<br>

That this faire Action may on foot be brought.<br>

<p id="id13184"> Nym. Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolfe</p><br>

<p id="id13185"> Bar. What, are Ancient Pistoll and you friends yet?
 Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little: but when
time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as
it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out
mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though? It will
toste Cheese, and it will endure cold, as another mans
sword will: and there's an end</p><br>

<p id="id13186"> Bar. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friendes,
and wee'l bee all three sworne brothers to France: Let't
be so good Corporall Nym</p><br>

<p id="id13187"> Nym. Faith, I will liue so long as I may, that's the certaine
of it: and when I cannot liue any longer, I will doe
as I may: That is my rest, that is the rendeuous of it</p><br>

<p id="id13188"> Bar. It is certaine Corporall, that he is marryed to
Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you
were troth-plight to her</p><br>

<p id="id13189"> Nym. I cannot tell, Things must be as they may: men
may sleepe, and they may haue their throats about them
at that time, and some say, kniues haue edges: It must
be as it may, though patience be a tyred name, yet shee
will plodde, there must be Conclusions, well, I cannot
tell.
Enter Pistoll, &amp; Quickly.</p><br>

<p id="id13190">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar. Heere comes Ancient Pistoll and his wife: good<br>

Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll?<br>

<p id="id13191"> Host. No by my troth, not long: For we cannot lodge
and board a dozen or fourteene Gentlewomen that liue
honestly by the pricke of their Needles, but it will bee
thought we keepe a Bawdy-house straight. O welliday

in thy throate, and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw
perdy; and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth. I
do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and Pistols
cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow</p><br>

<p id="id13198"> Nym. I am not Barbason, you cannot coniure mee: I
haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you
grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my
Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes. If you would walke
off, I would pricke your guts a little in good tearmes, as
I may, and that's the humor of it</p><br>

<p id="id13199">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pist. O Braggard vile, and damned furious wight,<br>

Therefore exhale<br>

<p id="id13203">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pistoll. Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defie thee againe.<br>

O hound of Creet, think'st thou my spouse to get?<br>

No, to the spittle goe, and from the Poudring tub of infamy,<br>

fetch forth the Lazar Kite of Cressids kinde, Doll<br>

Teare-sheete, she by name, and her espouse. I haue, and I<br>

Sweet men, come to him</p><br>

As if allegeance in their bosomes sate<br>

Crowned with faith, and constant loyalty<br>

By interception, which they dreame not of<br>

<p id="id13226">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,<br>

That growes not in a faire consent with ours:<br>

Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish<br>

Successe and Conquest to attend on vs<br>

Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you<br>

With hearts create of duty, and of zeale<br>

<p id="id13234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,<br>

And shall forget the office of our hand<br>

Sooner then quittance of desert and merit,<br>

According to the weight and worthinesse<br>

<p id="id13235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scro. So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,<br>

And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope<br>

To do your Grace incessant seruices<br>

It was excesse of Wine that set him on,<br>

And on his more aduice, We pardon him<br>

Let him be punish'd Soueraigne, least example<br>

Breed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind<br>

<p id="id13238"> King. O let vs yet be mercifull</p><br>

<p id="id13239"> Cam. So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too</p><br>

After the taste of much correction<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13241">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Alas, your too much loue and care of me,<br>

Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:<br>

If little faults proceeding on distemper,<br>

Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye<br>

When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,<br>

Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,<br>

Though Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care<br>

And tender preseruation of our person<br>

Gray of Northumberland, this same is yours:<br>

Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.<br>

My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,<br>

We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?<br>

What see you in those papers, that you loose<br>

So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:<br>

Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,<br>

That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood<br>

Out of apparance<br>

You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,<br>

For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,<br>

As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:<br>

See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,<br>

These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,<br>

You know how apt our loue was, to accord<br>

To furnish with all appertinents<br>

Belonging to his Honour; and this man,<br>

Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd<br>

And sworne vnto the practises of France<br>

To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,<br>

This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs<br>

Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,<br>

What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,<br>

Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?<br>

Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,<br>

That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,<br>

That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,<br>

Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?<br>

May it be possible, that forraigne hyer<br>

Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill<br>

That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,<br>

That though the truth of it stands off as grosse<br>

As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.<br>

Treason, and murther, euer kept together,<br>

As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,<br>

Working so grossely in an naturall cause,<br>

That admiration did not hoope at them.<br>

But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in<br>

Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:<br>

And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was<br>

That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,<br>

Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:<br>

And other diuels that suggest by treasons,<br>

Do botch and bungle vp damnation,<br>

With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht<br>

From glist'ring semblances of piety:<br>

But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,<br>

Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,<br>

Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.<br>

If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,<br>

Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,<br>

He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,<br>

And tell the Legions, I can neuer win<br>

A soule so easie as that Englishmans.<br>

Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected<br>

The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,<br>

Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?<br>

Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?<br>

Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?<br>

Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,<br>

Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,<br>

Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,<br>

Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,<br>

Not working with the eye, without the eare,<br>

And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,<br>

Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:<br>

And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,<br>

To make thee full fraught man, and best indued<br>

With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.<br>

For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like<br>

Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,<br>

Arrest them to the answer of the Law,<br>

And God acquit them of their practises<br>

How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,<br>

How modest in exception; and withall,<br>

How terrible in constant resolution:<br>

Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know<br>

'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme,<br>

Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes,<br>

Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree:<br>

From him, the Natiue and true Challenger<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne<br>

Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.<br>

Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,<br>

In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue:<br>

That if requiring faile, he will compell.<br>

And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,<br>

Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie<br>

On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre<br>

Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head<br>

Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,<br>

The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,<br>

For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,<br>

That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.<br>

And any thing that may not mis-become<br>

The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.<br>

Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse<br>

Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;<br>

for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,
hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole
Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece
of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues

Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put

I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their

I must cast it vp.

<p id="id13320"> Gower. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to
the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with
you</p><br>

<p id="id13321"> Flu. To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so
good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes
is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities
of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuersarie,
you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt
himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu,
I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions</p><br>

<p id="id13322"> Gower. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order
of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish
man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith</p><br>

<p id="id13323">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welch. It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gower. I thinke it be<br>

<p id="id13324"> Welch. By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will
verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions

Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.
Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy.</p><br>

<p id="id13325">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gower. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine<br>

Iamy, with him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13326"> Welch. Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman,
that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge
in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge
of his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his
Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in
the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans</p><br>

<p id="id13327"> Scot. I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen</p><br>

<p id="id13328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welch. Godden to your Worship, good Captaine<br>

Iames<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13329"> Gower. How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you
quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're?
 Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish
giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand
I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done:
it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,
so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill
done: by my Hand tish ill done</p><br>

<p id="id13330"> Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now,
will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with
you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,
looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie
my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of
my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline,
that is the Point</p><br>

<p id="id13331"> Scot. It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,
and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:
that sall I mary</p><br>

<p id="id13332"> Irish. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:
the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the
King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town
is beseech'd: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and
we talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:
so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my
hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be
done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law</p><br>

<p id="id13333"> Scot. By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues
to slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th'

as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and
the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question
tween you tway</p><br>

<p id="id13334" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you,
vnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation</p><br>

Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What
ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?
 Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise
then is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I
shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in
discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good
a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and
in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities</p><br>

<p id="id13338"> Scot. A, that's a foule fault.</p><br>

<p id="id13339">A Parley.</p><br>

<p id="id13340"> Gower. The Towne sounds a Parley</p><br>

<p id="id13341"> Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more
better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be
so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:

What is it then to me, if impious Warre,<br>

Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends,<br>

Of hot and forcing Violation?<br>

When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere?<br>

Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany.<br>

If not: why in a moment looke to see<br>

The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand<br>

Desire the Locks of your shrill-shriking Daughters:<br>

Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards,<br>

And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls:<br>

Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes,<br>

Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd,<br>

Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry,<br>

At Herods bloody-hunting slaughter-men.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed<br>

at the Bridge<br>

<p id="id13398"> Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
 Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient
Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
him doe as gallant seruice</p><br>

<p id="id13403">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at<br>

his hands<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13404"> Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone</p><br>

<p id="id13405"> Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is
painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description
of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall</p><br>

<p id="id13406"> Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter
hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
his Life, and I will thee requite</p><br>

<p id="id13407" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your
meaning</p><br>

<p id="id13408"> Pist. Why then reioyce therefore</p><br>

<p id="id13409"> Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;
for discipline ought to be vsed</p><br>

<p id="id13410"> Pist. Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship</p><br>

Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
when time is serue</p><br>

<p id="id13416"> Gower. Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:
who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd,
what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among
foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull
to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke</p><br>

<p id="id13417"> Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue
hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
must speake with him from the Pridge.</p><br>

<p id="id13418">Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.</p><br>

<p id="id13419"> Flu. God plesse your Maiestie</p><br>

<p id="id13420"> King. How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
 Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
the Duke is a praue man</p><br>

<p id="id13421"> King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?
 Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie
know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
out</p><br>

<p id="id13422"> King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages;
nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
Gamester is the soonest winner.</p><br>

<p id="id13426"> King. Vnfold it</p><br>

<p id="id13427"> Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:
England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,
and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider
of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse
satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
so much my Office</p><br>

<p id="id13428"> King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie</p><br>

<p id="id13429"> Mount. Mountioy</p><br>

<p id="id13430">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe,<br>

And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,<br>

But could be willing to march on to Callice,<br>

Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,<br>

Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much<br>

Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,<br>

My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,<br>

My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,<br>

Almost no better then so many French;<br>

Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,<br>

I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges<br>

Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,<br>

That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France<br>

Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:<br>

Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;<br>

My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;<br>

My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:<br>

Yet God before, tell him we will come on,<br>

Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor<br>

Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy.<br>

Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.<br>

If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,<br>

We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood<br>

Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well.<br>

The summe of all our Answer is but this:<br>

We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,<br>

Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:<br>

So tell your Master<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13431"> Mount. I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse</p><br>

<p id="id13432"> Glouc. I hope they will not come vpon vs now</p><br>

<p id="id13433">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs:<br>

March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night,<br>

Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues,<br>

And on to morrow bid them march away.<br>

my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:
ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were
hayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de
feu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots
the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest
horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of
Hermes</p><br>

<p id="id13441"> Orleance. Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg</p><br>

<p id="id13442"> Dolph. And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast
for Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements
of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only
in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee
is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call
Beasts</p><br>

<p id="id13443">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Const. Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent<br>

Horse<br>

the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces
Homage</p><br>

<p id="id13445"> Orleance. No more Cousin</p><br>

<p id="id13446"> Dolph. Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from
the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,
varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as
fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,
and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect
for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne
to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,
and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,
and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,

<p id="id13452"> Dolph. So perhaps did yours</p><br>

<p id="id13453"> Const. Mine was not bridled</p><br>

<p id="id13454"> Dolph. O then belike she was old and gentle, and you

your strait Strossers</p><br>

<p id="id13455"> Const. You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship</p><br>

<p id="id13456"> Dolph. Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and

Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,

<p id="id13468"> Const. I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out

That the fixt Centinels almost receiue<br>

The secret Whispers of each others Watch.<br>

Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames<br>

Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face.<br>

Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents,<br>

Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle,<br>

they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army</p><br>

<p id="id13544"> Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:
but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe
in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here</p><br>

<p id="id13545"> King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
but where hee is</p><br>

<p id="id13546" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued</p><br>

<p id="id13547"> King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him
here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,
as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
his Quarrell honorable</p><br>

<p id="id13548"> Williams. That's more then we know</p><br>

<p id="id13549"> Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
the Cryme of it out of vs</p><br>

<p id="id13550"> Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe
hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed
at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;
some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion
of subiection</p><br>

<p id="id13551"> King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation
of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed
vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder
his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,
be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement
of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:
some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling
Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored
the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.
Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne
Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip
men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before
guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue
that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
how they should prepare</p><br>

<p id="id13552">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon<br>

his owne head, the King is not to answer it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13553">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and<br>

yet I determine to fight lustily for him<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13554">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be<br>

ransom'd<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13555"> Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
ne're the wiser</p><br>

<p id="id13556"> King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after</p><br>

<p id="id13557"> Will. You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
come, 'tis a foolish saying</p><br>

<p id="id13558">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should<br>

be angry with you, if the time were conuenient<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13559">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you<br>

liue<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13560"> King. I embrace it</p><br>

<p id="id13561">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. How shall I know thee againe?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it<br>

in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it,<br>

I will make it my Quarrell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13562">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of<br>

by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare</p><br>

<p id="id13565"> King. If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it</p><br>

<p id="id13566"> Will. Thou dar'st as well be hang'd</p><br>

<p id="id13567">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id13568"> Will. Keepe thy word: fare thee well</p><br>

<p id="id13569" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Bates. Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee

With Titles blowne from Adulation?<br>

And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,<br>

Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,<br>

The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.<br>

Marke then abounding valour in our English:<br>

They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck<br>

The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,<br>

And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,<br>

As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then<br>

Will soone be leuyed.<br>

Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,<br>

The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes.<br>

Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer<br>

Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,<br>

And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes<br>

That bloodily did yawne vpon his face.<br>

He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke,<br>

My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen:<br>

Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a-brest:<br>

As in this glorious and well-foughten field<br>

We kept together in our Chiualrie.<br>

Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp,<br>

He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,<br>

And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord,<br>

Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne,<br>

So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke<br>

He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes,<br>

And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd<br>

A Testament of Noble-ending-loue:<br>

The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd<br>

Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd,<br>

<p id="id13667"> Flu. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery
marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
now, is it not?
 Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done
this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away
all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners
throat. O 'tis a gallant King</p><br>

<p id="id13668">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower:<br>

What call you the Townes name where Alexander the<br>

pig was borne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gow. Alexander the Great<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13669"> Flu. Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,
are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations</p><br>

<p id="id13670"> Gower. I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in
Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I
take it</p><br>

<p id="id13671"> Flu. I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is
porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene
Macedon &amp; Monmouth, that the situations looke
you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, &amp; there
is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at
Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is
come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his
rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
Clytus</p><br>

<p id="id13672" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
any of his friends</p><br>

<p id="id13673"> Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander
kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his
good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name</p><br>

And not a man of them that we shall take,<br>

Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.<br>

To booke our dead, and then to bury them,<br>

To sort our Nobles from our common men.<br>

For many of our Princes (woe the while)<br>

Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:<br>

So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes<br>

In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds<br>

Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage<br>

Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,<br>

Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,<br>

To view the field in safety, and dispose<br>

Of their dead bodies<br>

is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue

Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;<br>

How many would the peacefull Citie quit,<br>

sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke:
it was in a place where I could not breed no contention
with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap
till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little
piece of my desires.
Enter Pistoll.</p><br>

<p id="id13753"> Gower. Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turkycock</p><br>

looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not

will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking &amp; galling
at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise,

With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,<br>

To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties<br>

Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;<br>

Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.<br>

Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,<br>

That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,<br>

You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,<br>

If I demand before this Royall view,<br>

What Rub, or what Impediment there is,<br>

Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,<br>

Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,<br>

Should not in this best Garden of the World,<br>

Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?<br>

Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,<br>

And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,<br>

Corrupting in it owne fertilitie.<br>

Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,<br>

Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,<br>

Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,<br>

Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,<br>

The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,<br>

Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,<br>

That should deracinate such Sauagery:<br>

The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth<br>

The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,<br>

Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;<br>

Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,<br>

But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,<br>

Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;<br>

And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,<br>

Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.<br>

Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,<br>

Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,<br>

The Sciences that should become our Countrey;<br>

But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,<br>

That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,<br>

To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,<br>

And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.<br>

Which to reduce into our former fauour,<br>

You are assembled: and my speech entreats,<br>

That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace<br>

Should not expell these inconueniences,<br>

And blesse vs with her former qualities<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13787">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,<br>

Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections<br>

Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace<br>

With full accord to all our iust demands,<br>

Whose Tenures and particular effects<br>

You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands<br>

Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,<br>

Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,<br>

And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13797">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake<br>

your England<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13798"> King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly
with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse
it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
like me, Kate?
 Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me</p><br>

<p id="id13799">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an<br>

Angell<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13800">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13801">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush<br>

to affirme it<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13802">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de<br>

tromperies<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13803">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of<br>

men are full of deceits?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:<br>

dat is de Princesse<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id13804"> King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:
yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly
to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:
how say you, Lady?
 Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well</p><br>

<p id="id13805"> King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one
I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by
vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?
that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and
vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the
Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
and fairely, I pray thee</p><br>

<p id="id13806"> Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
Fraunce?
 King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue
the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
is France, and you are mine</p><br>

<p id="id13807"> Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat</p><br>

<p id="id13808"> King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife
about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie
quand sur le possession de Fraunce, &amp; quand vous aues le
possession
de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee
my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, &amp; vous estes mienne.
It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me</p><br>

<p id="id13809" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%"> Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il
&amp; melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle</p><br>

<p id="id13810"> King. No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st
thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
mee?
 Kath. I cannot tell</p><br>

<p id="id13811"> King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile
aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather
gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:
Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire
Flower-de-Luce</p><br>

<p id="id13812"> Kate. I doe not know dat</p><br>

<p id="id13813"> King. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your
French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,
take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer

<p id="id13815"> King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare
not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter
me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne
out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder
I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,
will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of
England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England
is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his
Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer
in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,
breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
haue me?
 Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere</p><br>
