<h3>(<i>Pandava-Pravesa Parva</i>)</h3>
<p>OM! Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of
male beings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word
<i>Jaya</i> be uttered.</p><br>
<p>Janamejaya said, "How did my great-grandfathers, afflicted with
the fear of Duryodhana, pass their days undiscovered in the city of
Virata? And, O Brahman, how did the highly blessed Draupadi,
stricken with woe, devoted to her lords, and ever adoring the
Deity<sup>1</sup>, spend her days unrecognised?"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Listen, O lord of men, how thy great
grandfathers passed the period of unrecognition in the city of
Virata. Having in this way obtained boons from the god of Justice,
that best of virtuous men, Yudhishthira, returned to the asylum and
related unto the Brahmanas all that had happened. And having
related everything unto them, Yudhishthira restored to that
regenerate Brahmana who had followed him the churning staff and the
fire-sticks he had lost. And, O Bharata, the son of the god of
Justice, the royal Yudhishthira of high soul then called together
all his younger brothers and addressed them, saying, 'Exiled from
our kingdom, we have passed twelve years. The thirteenth year, hard
to spend, hath now come. Do thou therefore, O Arjuna, the son of
Kunti, select some spot where we may pass our days undiscovered by
our enemies.'</p><br>
<p>"Arjuna replied, "Even by virtue of Dharma's boon, we shall, O
lord of men, range about undiscovered by men. Still, for purposes
of residence, I shall mention some spots that are both delightful
and secluded. Do thou select some one of them. Surrounding the
kingdom of the Kurus, are, many countries beautiful and abounding
in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara,
Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti,
and the spacious Kuntirashtra. Which of these, O king, wouldst thou
choose, and where, O foremost of monarchs, shall we spend this
year?'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said 'O thou of mighty arms, it is even so. What
that adorable Lord of all creatures hath said must become true.
Surely, after consulting together, we must select some delightful,
auspicious, and agreeable region for our abode, where we may live
free from fear. The aged Virata, king of the Matsyas, is virtuous
and powerful and charitable, and is liked by all. And he is also
attached to the Pandavas. Even in the city of Virata, O child, we
shall, O Bharata, spend this year, entering his service. Tell me,
ye sons of the Kuru race, in what capacities ye will severally
present yourselves before the king of the Matsyas!'</p><br>
<p>"Arjuna said, 'O god among men, what service wilt thou take in
Virata's kingdom? O righteous one, in what capacity wilt thou
reside in the city of Virata? Thou art mild, and charitable, and
modest, and virtuous, and firm in promise. What wilt thou, O king,
afflicted as thou art with calamity, do? A king is qualified to
bear trouble like an ordinary person. How wilt thou overcome this
great calamity that has overtaken thee?'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira replied, 'Ye sons of the Kuru race, ye bulls among
men, hear what I shall do on appearing before king Virata.
Presenting myself as a Brahmana, Kanka by name, skilled in dice and
fond of play, I shall become a courtier of that high-souled king.
And moving upon chess-boards beautiful pawns made of ivory, of blue
and yellow and red and white hue, by throws of black and red dice,
I shall entertain the king with his courtiers and friends. And
while I shall continue to thus delight the king, nobody will
succeed in discovering me. And should the monarch ask me, I shall
say, <i>Formerly I was the bosom friend of Yudhishthira</i>. I tell
you that it is thus that I shall pass my days (in the city of
Virata). What office wilt thou, O Vrikodara, fill in the city of
Virata?'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION II</h2>
<p>"Bhima said, 'I intend to present myself before the lord of
Virata as a cook bearing the name of Vallava. I am skilled in
culinary art, and I shall prepare curries for the king, and
excelling all those skilful cooks that had hitherto dressed his
food I shall gratify the monarch. And I shall carry mighty loads of
wood. And witnessing that mighty feat, the monarch will be pleased.
And, O Bharata, beholding such superhuman feats of mine, the
servants of the royal household will honour me as a king. And I
shall have entire control over all kinds of viands and drinks. And
commanded to subdue powerful elephants and mighty bulls, I will do
as bidden. And if any combatants will fight with me in the lists,
then will I vanquish them, and thereby entertain the monarch. But I
shall not take the life of any of them. I shall only bring them
down in such way that they may not be killed. And on being asked as
regards my antecedent I shall say that?<i>Formerly I was the
wrestler and cook of Yudhishthira.</i> Thus shall I, O king,
maintain myself.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'And what office will be performed by that
mighty descendant of the Kurus, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, that
foremost of men possessed of long arms, invincible in fight, and
before whom, while he was staying with Krishna, the divine Agni
himself desirous of consuming the forest of Khandava had formerly
appeared in the guise of a Brahmana? What office will be performed
by that best of warriors, Arjuna, who proceeded to that forest and
gratified Agni, vanquishing on a single car and slaying huge
<i>Nagas</i> and <i>Rakshasas</i>, and who married the sister of
Vasuki himself, the king of the <i>Nagas</i>? Even as the sun is
the foremost of all heat-giving bodies, as the Brahmana is the best
of all bipeds, as the cobra is the foremost of all serpents, as
Fire is the first of all things possessed of energy, as the
thunderbolt is the foremost of all weapons, as the humped bull is
the foremost of all animals of the bovine breed, as the ocean is
the foremost of all watery expanses, as clouds charged with rain
are the foremost of all clouds, as Ananta is the first of all
<i>Nagas</i>, as Airavata is the foremost of all elephants, as the
son is the foremost of all beloved objects, and lastly, as the wife
is the best of all friends, so, O Vrikodara, is the youthful
Gudakesa, the foremost of all bowmen. And O Bharata, what office
will be performed by Vibhatsu, the wielder of <i>Gandiva</i>, whose
car is drawn by white horses, and who is not inferior to Indra or
Vasudeva Himself? What office will be performed by Arjuna who,
dwelling for five years in the abode of the thousand-eyed Deity
(Indra) shining in celestial lustre, acquired by his own energy the
science of superhuman arms with all celestial weapons, and whom I
regard as the tenth <i>Rudra</i>, the thirteenth <i>Aditya</i>, the
ninth <i>Vasu</i>, and the tenth <i>Graha</i>, whose arms,
symmetrical and long, have the skin hardened by constant strokes of
the bowstring and cicatrices which resemble those on the humps of
bulls,?that foremost of warriors who is as Himavat among
mountains, the ocean among expanses of water, Sakra among the
celestial, Havyavaha (fire) among the Vasus, the tiger among
beasts, and Garuda among feathery tribes!'</p><br>
<p>"Arjuna replied, 'O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as
one of the neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide
the marks of the bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both
my cicatrized arms with bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears
and conch-bangles on my wrists and causing a braid to hang down
from my head, I shall, O king, appear as one of the third sex,
Vrihannala by name. And living as a female I shall (always)
entertain the king and the inmates of the inner apartments by
reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the women of
Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and in
musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the
various excellent acts of men and thus conceal myself, O son of
Kunti, by feigning disguise. And, O Bharata should the king
enquire, I will say that, <i>I lived as a waiting maid of Draupadi
in Yudhishthira's palace</i>. And, O foremost of kings, concealing
myself by this means, as fire is concealed by ashes, I shall pass
my days agreeably in the palace of Virata.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this, Arjuna, that best of
men and foremost of virtuous persons, became silent. Then the king
addressed another brother of his."<sup>2</sup></p><br>
<h2>SECTION III</h2>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tender, possessed of a graceful presence,
and deserving of every luxury as thou art, what office wilt thou, O
heroic Nakula, discharge while living in the dominions of that
king? Tell me all about it!'</p><br>
<p>"Nakula said, 'Under the name of Granthika, I shall become the
keeper of the horses of king Virata. I have a thorough knowledge
(of this work) and am skilful in tending horses. Besides, the task
is agreeable to me, and I possess great skill in training and
treating horses; and horses are ever dear to me as they are to
thee, O king of the Kurus. At my hands even colts and mares become
docile; these never become vicious in bearing a rider or drawing a
car.<sup>3</sup> And those persons in the city of
Virata that may enquire of me, I shall, O bull of the Bharata race,
say,?<i>Formerly I was employed by Yudhishthira in the charge
of his horses</i>. Thus disguised, O king, I shall spend my days
delightfully in the city of Virata. No one will be able to discover
me as I will gratify the monarch thus!'<sup>4</sup></p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'How wilt thou, O Sahadeva, bear thyself
before that king? And what, O child, is that which thou wilt do in
order to live in disguise.'</p><br>
<p>"Sahadeva replied, 'I will become a keeper of the king of
Virata's kine. I am skilled in milking kine and taking their
history as well as in taming their fierceness. Passing under the
name of Tantripala, I shall perform my duties deftly. Let thy
heart's fever be dispelled. Formerly I was frequently employed to
look after thy kine, and, O Lord of earth, I have a particular
knowledge of that work. And, O monarch, I am well-acquainted with
the nature of kine, as also with their auspicious marks and other
matters relating to them. I can also discriminate bulls with
auspicious marks, the scent of whose urine may make even the barren
being forth child. Even thus will I live, and I always take delight
in work of this kind. Indeed, no one will then be able to recognise
me, and I will moreover gratify the monarch.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'This is our beloved wife dearer to us than
our lives. Verily, she deserveth to be cherished by us like a
mother, and regarded like an elder sister. Unacquainted as she is
with any kind of womanly work, what office will Krishna, the
daughter of Drupada, perform? Delicate and young, she is a princess
of great repute. Devoted to her lords, and eminently virtuous,
also, how will she live? Since her birth, she hath enjoyed only
garlands and perfumes and ornaments and costly robes.'</p><br>
<p>"Draupadi replied, 'There is a class of persons called
<i>Sairindhris</i>,<sup>5</sup> who enter
the services of other. Other females, however (that are
respectable) do not do so. Of this class there are some. I shall
give myself out as a <i>Sairindhri</i>, skilled in dressing hair.
And, O Bharata, on being questioned by the king, I shall say that I
served as a waiting woman of Draupadi in Yudhishthira's household.
I shall thus pass my days in disguise. And I shall serve the famous
Sudeshna, the wife of the king. Surely, obtaining me she will
cherish me (duly). Do not grieve so, O king.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Krishna, thou speakest well. But O fair
girl, thou wert born in a respectable family. Chaste as thou art,
and always engaged in observing virtuous vows, thou knowest not
what is sin. Do thou, therefore, conduct thyself in such a way that
sinful men of evil hearts may not be gladdened by gazing at
thee.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION IV</h2>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'Ye have already said what offices ye will
respectively perform. I also, according to the measure of my sense,
have said what office I will perform. Let our priest, accompanied
by charioteers and cooks, repair to the abode of Drupada, and there
maintain our <i>Agnihotra</i> fires. And let Indrasena and the
others, taking with them the empty cars, speedily proceeded to
Dwaravati. Even this is my wish. And let all these maid-servants of
Draupadi go to the Panchalas, with our charioteers and cooks. And
let all of them say,?<i>We do not know where the Pandavas
have gone leaving us at the lake of Dwaitavana</i>.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Having thus taken counsel of one another and
told one another the offices they would discharge, the Pandavas
sought Dhaumya's advice. And Dhaumya also gave them advice in the
following words, saying, 'Ye sons of Pandu, the arrangements ye
have made regarding the Brahmanas, your friends, cars, weapons, and
the (sacred) fires, are excellent. But it behoveth thee, O
Yudhishthira, and Arjuna specially, to make provision for the
protection of Draupadi. Ye king, ye are well-acquainted with the
characters of men. Yet whatever may be your knowledge, friends may
from affection be permitted to repeat what is already known. Even
this is subservient to the eternal interests of virtue, pleasure,
and profit. I shall, therefore speak to you something. Mark ye. To
dwell with a king is, alas, difficult. I shall tell you, ye
princes, how ye may reside in the royal household, avoiding every
fault. Ye Kauravas, honourably or otherwise, ye will have to pass
this year in the king's palace, undiscovered by those that know
you. Then in the fourteenth year, ye will live happy. O son of
Pandu, in this world, that cherisher and protector of all beings,
the king, who is a deity in an embodied form, is as a great fire
sanctified with all the <i>mantras</i>.<sup>6</sup> One should
present himself before the king, after having obtained his
permission at the gate. No one should keep contact with royal
secrets. Nor should one desire a seat which another may covet. He
who doth not, regarding himself to be a favourite, occupy (the
king's) car, or coach, or seat, or vehicle, or elephant, is alone
worthy of dwelling in a royal household. He that sits not upon a
seat the occupation of which is calculated raise alarm in the minds
of malicious people, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal
household. No one should, unasked offer counsel (to a king). Paying
homage in season unto the king, one should silently and
respectfully sit beside the king, for kings take umbrage at
babblers, and disgrace lying counsellors. A wise person should not
contact friendship with the king's wife, nor with the inmates of
the inner apartments, nor with those that are objects of royal
displeasure. One about the king should do even the most unimportant
acts and with the king's knowledge. Behaving thus with a sovereign,
one doth not come by harm. Even if an individual attain the highest
office, he should, as long as he is not asked or commanded,
consider himself as born-blind, having regard to the king's
dignity, for O repressers of foes, the rulers of men do not forgive
even their sons and grandsons and brothers when they happen to
tamper with their dignity. Kings should be served with regardful
care, even as Agni and other gods; and he that is disloyal to his
sovereign, is certainly destroyed by him. Renouncing anger, and
pride, and negligence, it behoveth a man to follow the course
directed by the monarch. After carefully deliberating on all
things, a person should set forth before the king those topics that
are both profitable and pleasant; but should a subject be
profitable without being pleasant, he should still communicate it,
despite its disagreeableness. It behoveth a man to be well-disposed
towards the king in all his interests, and not to indulge in speech
that is alike unpleasant and profitless. Always thinking?<i>I
am not liked by the king</i>?one should banish negligence,
and be intent on bringing about what is agreeable and advantageous
to him. He that swerveth not from his place, he that is not
friendly to those that are hostile to the king, he that striveth
not to do wrong to the king, is alone worthy to dwell in a royal
household. A learned man should sit either on the king's right or
the left; he should not sit behind him for that is the place
appointed for armed guards, and to sit before him is always
interdicted. Let none, when the king is engaged in doing anything
(in respect of his servants) come forward pressing himself
zealously before others, for even if the aggrieved be very poor,
such conduct would still be inexcusable.<sup>7</sup> It
behoveth no man to reveal to others any lie the king may have told
inasmuch as the king bears ill will to those that report his
falsehoods. Kings also always disregard persons that regard
themselves as learned. No man should be proud thinking?<i>I
am brave, or, I am intelligent</i>, but a person obtains the good
graces of a king and enjoys the good things of life, by behaving
agreeably to the wishes of the king. And, O Bharata, obtaining
things agreeable, and wealth also which is so hard to acquire, a
person should always do what is profitable as well as pleasant to
the king. What man that is respected by the wise can even think of
doing mischief to one whose ire is great impediment and whose
favour is productive of mighty fruits? No one should move his lips,
arms and thighs, before the king. A person should speak and spit
before the king only mildly. In the presence of even laughable
objects, a man should not break out into loud laughter, like a
maniac; nor should one show (unreasonable) gravity by containing
himself, to the utmost. One should smile modestly, to show his
interest (in what is before him). He that is ever mindful of the
king's welfare, and is neither exhilarated by reward nor depressed
by disgrace, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal household. That
learned courtier who always pleaseth the king and his son with
agreeable speeches, succeedeth in dwelling in a royal household as
a favourite. The favourite courtier who, having lost the royal
favour for just reason, does not speak evil of the king, regains
prosperity. The man who serveth the king or liveth in his domains,
if sagacious, should speak in praise of the king, both in his
presence and absence. The courtier who attempts to obtain his end
by employing force on the king, cannot keep his place long and
incurs also the risk of death. None should, for the purpose of
self-interest, open communications with the king's enemies.<sup>8</sup> Nor should one distinguish himself
above the king in matters requiring ability and talents. He that is
always cheerful and strong, brave and truthful and mild, and of
subdued senses, and who followeth his master like his shadow, is
alone worthy to dwell in a royal household. He that on being
entrusted with a work, cometh forward, saying,?<i>I will do
this</i>?is alone worthy of living in a royal household. He
that on being entrusted with a task, either within the king's
dominion or out of it, never feareth to undertake it, is alone fit
to reside in a royal household. He that living away from his home,
doth no remember his dear ones, and who undergoeth (present) misery
in expectation of (future) happiness, is alone worthy of dwelling
in a royal household. One should not dress like the king, nor
should one indulge in laughter in the king's presence nor should
one disclose royal secrets. By acting thus one may win royal
favour. Commissioned to a task, one should not touch bribes for by
such appropriation one becometh liable to fetters or death. The
robes, ornaments, cars, and other things which the king may be
pleased to bestow should always be used, for by this, one winneth
the royal favour. Ye children, controlling your minds, do ye spend
this year, ye sons of Pandu, behaving in this way. Regaining your
own kingdom, ye may live as ye please.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'We have been well taught by thee. Blessed
be thou. There is none that could say so to us, save our mother
Kunti and Vidura of great wisdom. It behoveth thee to do all that
is necessary now for our departure, and for enabling us to come
safely through this woe, as well as for our victory over the
foe.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Yudhishthira,
Dhaumya, that best of Brahmanas, performed according to the
ordinance the rites ordained in respect of departure. And lighting
up their fires, he offered, with <i>mantras</i>, oblations on them
for the prosperity and success of the Pandavas, as for their
reconquest of the whole world. And walking round those fires and
round the Brahmanas of ascetic wealth, the six set out, placing
Yajnaseni in their front. And when those heroes had departed,
Dhaumya, that best of ascetics, taking their sacred fires, set out
for the Panchalas. And Indrasena, and others already mentioned,
went to the Yadavas, and looking after the horses and the cars of
the Pandavas passed their time happily and in privacy."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION V</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Girding their waists with swords, and
equipped with finger-protectors made of iguana skins and with
various weapons, those heroes proceeded in the direction of the
river Yamuna. And those bowmen desirous of (speedily) recovering
their kingdom, hitherto living in inaccessible hills and forest
fastnesses, now terminated their forest-life and proceeded to the
southern bank of that river. And those mighty warriors endued with
great strength and hitherto leading the lives of hunters by killing
the deer of the forest, passed through <i>Yakrilloma</i> and
Surasena, leaving behind, on their right, the country of the
Panchalas, and on their left, that of the Dasarnas. And those
bowmen, looking wan and wearing beards and equipped with swords,
entered Matsya's dominions leaving the forest, giving themselves
out as hunters. And on arriving at that country, Krishna addressed
Yudhishthira, saying, 'We see footpaths here, and various fields.
From this it appears that Virata's metropolis is still at a
distance. Pass we here what part of the night is still left, for
great is my fatigue.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira answered, 'O Dhananjaya of Bharata's race, do thou
take up Panchali and carry her. Just on emerging from this forest,
we arrive at the city.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thereupon like the leader of a herd of
elephants, Arjuna speedily took up Draupadi, and on coming to the
vicinity of the city, let her down. And on reaching the city,
Ruru's son (Yudhishthira), addressed Arjuna, saying, 'Where shall
we deposit our weapons, before entering the city? If, O child, we
enter it with our weapons about us, we shall thereby surely excite
the alarm of the citizens. Further, the tremendous bow, the
<i>Gandiva</i>, is known to all men, so that people will, without
doubt, recognise us soon. And if even one of us is discovered, we
shall, according to promise, have to pass another twelve years in
the forest.'</p><br>
<p>"Arjuna said, 'Hard by yon cemetery and near that inaccessible
peak is a mighty <i>Sami</i> tree, throwing-about its gigantic
branches and difficult to ascend. Nor is there any human being,
who, I think, O Pandu's son, will espy us depositing our arms at
that place. That tree is in the midst of an out-of-the way forest
abounding in beasts and snakes, and is in the vicinity of a dreary
cemetery. Stowing away our weapons on the <i>Sami</i> tree, let us,
O Bharata, go to the city, and live there, free from anxiety!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Having O bull of the Bharata race
spoken thus to king Yudhishthira the just, Arjuna prepared to
deposit the weapons (on the tree). And that bull among the Kurus,
then loosened the string of the large and dreadful <i>Gandiva</i>,
ever producing thundering twang and always destructive of hostile
hosts, and with which he had conquered, on a single car, gods and
men and <i>Nagas</i> and swelling provinces. And the warlike
Yudhishthira, that represser of foes, unfastened the undecaying
string of that bow with which he had defended the field of
Kurukshetra. And the illustrious Bhimasena unstrung that bow by
means of which that sinless one had vanquished in fight the
Panchalas and the lord of Sindhu, and with which, during his career
of conquest, he had, single-handed, opposed innumerable foes, and
hearing whose twang which was like unto the roar of the thunder or
the splitting of a mountain, enemies always fly (in panic) from the
field of battle. And that son of Pandu of coppery complexion and
mild speech who is endued with great prowess in the field, and is
called Nakula in consequence of his unexampled beauty in the
family, then unfastened the string of that bow with which he had
conquered all the regions of the west. And the heroic Sahadeva
also, possessed of a mild disposition, then untied the string of
that bow with which he had subjugated the countries of the south.
And with their bows, they put together their long and flashing
swords, their precious quivers, and their arrows sharp as razors.
And Nakula ascended the tree, and deposited on it the bows and the
other weapons. And he tied them fast on those parts of the tree
which he thought would not break, and where the rain would not
penetrate. And the Pandavas hung up a corpse (on the tree), knowing
that people smelling the stench of the corpse would
say?<i>here sure, is a dead body</i>, and avoid the tree from
a distance. And on being asked by the shepherds and cowherds
regarding the corpse, those repressers of foes said unto them,
'This is our mother, aged one hundred and eighty years. We have
hung up her dead body, in accordance with the custom observed by
our forefathers.' And then those resisters of foes approached the
city. And for purposes of non-discovery Yudhishthira kept these
(five) names for himself and his brothers respectively, viz., Jaya,
Jayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, and Jayadvala. Then they entered the
great city, with the view to passing the thirteenth year
undiscovered in that kingdom, agreeably to the promise (to
Duryodhana)."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION VI</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "And while Yudhishthira was on his way to the
delightful city of Virata, he began to praise mentally the Divine
Durga, the Supreme Goddess of the Universe, born on the womb of
Yasoda, and fond of the boons bestowed on her by Narayana, sprung
from the race of cowherd Nanda, and the giver of prosperity, the
enhancer (of the glory) of (the worshipper's) family, the terrifier
of Kansa, and the destroyer of <i>Asuras</i>,?and saluted the
Goddess?her who ascended the skies when dashed (by Kansa) on
a stony platform, who is the sister of Vasudeva, one who is always
decked in celestial garlands and attired in celestial
robes,?who is armed with scimitar and shield, and always
rescues the worshipper sunk in sin, like a cow in the mire, who in
the hours of distress calls upon that eternal giver of blessings
for relieving him of their burdens. And the king, desirous with his
brothers of obtaining a sight of the Goddess, invoked her and began
to praise her by reciting various names derived from (approved)
hymns. And Yudhishthira said, 'Salutations to thee, O giver of
boons. O thou that art identical with Krishna, O maiden, O thou
that hast observed the vow of <i>Brahmacharya</i>, O thou of body
bright as the newly-risen Sun, O thou of face beautiful as the full
moon. Salutations to thee, O thou of four hands and four faces, O
thou of fair round hips and deep bosom, O thou that wearest bangles
made of emeralds and sapphires, O thou that bearest excellent
bracelets on thy upper arm. Thou shinest, O Goddess, as Padma, the
consort of Narayana. O thou that rangest the etherial regions, thy
true form and thy <i>Brahmacharya</i> are both of the purest kind.
Sable as the black clouds, thy face is beautiful as that of
<i>Sankarshana</i>. Thou bearest two large arms long as a couple of
poles raised in honour of Indra. In thy (six) other arms thou
bearest a vessel, a lotus, a bell, a noose, a bow, a large discus,
and various other weapons. Thou art the only female in the universe
that possessest the attribute of purity. Thou art decked with a
pair of well-made ears graced with excellent rings. O Goddess, thou
shinest with a face that challengeth the moon in beauty. With an
excellent diadem and beautiful braid with robes made of the bodies
of snakes, and with also the brilliant girdle round thy hips, thou
shinest like the Mandara mountain encircled with snakes. Thou
shinest also with peacock-plumes standing erect on thy head, and
thou hast sanctified the celestial regions by adopting the vow of
perpetual maiden-hood. It is for this, O thou that hast slain the
<i>Mahishasura</i>,<sup>9</sup> that thou
art praised and worshipped by the gods for the protection of the
three worlds. O thou foremost of all deities, extend to me thy
grace, show me thy mercy, and be thou the source of blessings to
me. Thou art <i>Jaya</i> and <i>Vijaya</i>, and it is thou that
givest victory in battle. Grant me victory, O Goddess, and give me
boons also at this hour of distress. Thy eternal abode is on
Vindhya?that foremost of mountains. O <i>Kali</i>, O
<i>Kali</i>, thou art the great <i>Kali</i>, ever fond of wine and
meat and animal sacrifice. Capable of going everywhere at will, and
bestowing boons on thy devotees, thou art ever followed in thy
journeys by Brahma and the other gods. By them that call upon thee
for the relief of their burdens, and by them also that bow to thee
at daybreak on Earth, there is nothing that cannot be attained in
respect either of offspring or wealth. And because thou rescuest
people from difficulties whether when they are afflicted in the
wilderness or sinking in the great ocean, it is for this that thou
art called <i>Durga</i><sup>10</sup> by all.
Thou art the sole refuge of men when attacked by robbers or while
afflicted in crossing streams and seas or in wilderness and
forests. Those men that remember thee are never prostrated, O great
Goddess. Thou art Fame, thou art Prosperity, thou art Steadiness,
thou art Success; thou art the Wife, thou art men's Offspring, thou
art Knowledge, and thou art the Intellect. Thou art the two
Twilights, the Night Sleep, Light?both solar and lunar,
Beauty, Forgiveness, Mercy, and every other thing. Thou dispellest,
worshipped by the devotees their fetters, ignorance, loss of
children and loss of wealth, disease, death, and fear. I, who have
been deprived of my kingdom, seek thy protection. And as I bow to
thee with bended head, O Supreme Goddess, grant me protection, O
thou of eyes like lotus leaves. And be thou as boon-giving Truth
unto us that are acting according to Truth. And, O Durga, kind as
thou art unto all that seek thy protection, and affectionate unto
all thy devotees, grant me protection!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus praised by the son of Pandu, the
Goddess showed herself unto him. And approaching the king, she
addressed him in these words, 'O mighty armed king, listen, O Lord,
to these words of mine. Having vanquished and slain the ranks of
the Kauravas through my grace, victory in battle will soon be
thine. Thou shalt again lord it over the entire Earth, having made
thy dominions destitute of thorns. And, O king, thou shalt also,
with thy brothers, obtain great happiness. And through my grace,
joy and health will be thine. And they also in the world who will
recite my attributes and achievements will be freed from their
sins, and gratified. I will bestow upon them kingdom, long life,
beauty of person, and offspring. And they, O king, who will invoke
me, after thy manner, in exile or in the city, in the midst of
battle or of dangers from foes, in forests or in inaccessible
deserts, in seas or mountain fastnesses, there is nothing that they
will not obtain in this world. And ye sons of Pandu, he will
achieve success in every business of his that will listen to, or
himself recite with devotion, this excellent hymn. And through my
grace neither the Kuru's spies, nor those that dwell in the country
of the Matsyas, will succeed in recognising you all as long as ye
reside in Virata's city!' And having said these words unto
Yudhishthira, that chastiser of foes, and having arranged for the
protection of the sons of Pandu, the Goddess disappeared there and
then."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION VII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Then tying up in his cloth dice made of gold
and set with <i>lapis lazuli</i>, and holding them below his
arm-pit, king Yudhishthira,?that illustrious lord of
men?that high-souled perpetuator of the Kuru race, regarded
by kings, irrepressible in might, and like unto a snake of virulent
poison,?that bull among men, endued with strength and beauty
and prowess, and possessed of greatness, and resembling in form a
celestial though now like unto the sun enveloped in dense clouds,
or fire covered with ashes, first made his appearance when the
famous king Virata was seated in his court. And beholding with his
followers that son of Pandu in his court, looking like the moon hid
in clouds and possessed of a face beautiful as the full moon, king
Virata addressed his counsellors and the twice-born ones and the
charioteers and the Vaisyas and others, saying, 'Enquire ye who it
is, so like a king that looketh on my court for the first time. He
cannot be a Brahmana. Methinks he is a man of men, and a lord of
earth. He hath neither slaves, nor cars, nor elephants with him,
yet he shineth like the very Indra. The marks on his person
indicate him to be one whose coronal locks have undergone the
sacred investiture. Even this is my belief. He approacheth me
without any hesitation, even as an elephant in rut approacheth an
assemblage of lotuses!'</p><br>
<p>"And as the king was indulging in these thoughts, that bull
among men, Yudhishthira, came before Virata and addressed him,
saying, 'O great king, know me for a Brahmana who, having lost his
all hath come to thee for the means of subsistence. I desire, O
sinless one, to live here beside thee acting under thy
commands,<sup>11</sup> O lord.' The king then,
well-pleased, replied unto him saying, 'Thou art welcome. Do thou
then accept the appointment thou seekest!' And having appointed the
lion among kings in the post he had prayed for, king Virata
addressed him with a glad heart, saying, 'O child, I ask thee from
affection, from the dominions of what king dost thou come hither?
Tell me also truly what is thy name and family, and what thou hast
a knowledge of.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'My name is Kanka, and I am a Brahmana
belonging to the family known by the name of <i>Vaiyaghra</i>. I am
skilled in casting dice, and formerly I was a friend of
Yudhishthira.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata replied, 'I will grant thee whatever boon thou mayst
desire. Do thou rule the Matsyas.?I shall remain in
submission to thee. Even cunning gamblers are liked by me. Thou, on
the other hand, art like a god, and deservest a kingdom.'</p><br>
<p>"Yudhishthira said, 'My first prayer, O lord of earth, is that I
may not be involved in any dispute (on account of dice) with low
people. Further, a person defeated by me (at dice) shall not be
permitted to retain the wealth (won by me). Let this boon be
granted to me through thy grace.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata replied, 'I shall certainly slay him who may happen to
displease thee, and should he be one of the twice-born ones, I
shall banish him from my dominions. Let the assembled subjects
listen! Kanka is as much lord of this realm as I myself. Thou
(Kanka) shalt be my friend and shalt ride the same vehicles as I.
And there shall also be at thy disposal apparel in plenty, and
various kinds of viands and drinks. And thou shalt look into my
affairs, both internal and external. And for thee all my doors
shall be open. When men out of employ or of strained circumstances
will apply to thee, do thou at all hours bring their words unto me,
and I will surely give them whatever they desire. No fear shall be
thine as long as thou residest with me.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Having thus obtained an interview with
Virata's king, and received from him boons, that heroic bull among
men, began to live happily, highly regarded by all. Nor could any
one discover him as he lived there."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION VIII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Then another endued with the dreadful
strength and blazing in beauty, approached king Virata, with the
playful gait of the lion. And holding in hand a cooking ladle and a
spoon, as also an unsheathed sword of sable hue and without a spot
on the blade, he came in the guise of a cook illumining all around
him by his splendour like the sun discovering the whole world. And
attired in black and possessed of the strength of the king of
mountains, he approached the king of the Matsyas and stood before
him. And beholding that king-like person before him, Virata
addressed his assembled subjects saying, 'Who is that youth, that
bull among men, with shoulders broad like those of a lion, and so
exceedingly beautiful? That person, never seen before, is like the
sun. Revolving the matter in my mind, I cannot ascertain who he is,
nor can I with even serious thoughts guess the intention of that
bull among men (in coming here). Beholding him, it seems to me that
he is either the king of the Gandharvas, or Purandara himself. Do
ye ascertain who it is that standeth before my eyes. Let him have
quickly what he seeks.' Thus commanded by king Virata, his
swift-footed messengers went up to the son of Kunti and informed
that younger brother of Yudhishthira of everything the king had
said. Then the high-souled son of Pandu, approaching Virata,
addressed him in words that were not unsuited to his object,
saying, 'O foremost of kings, I am a cook, Vallava by name. I am
skilled in dressing dishes. Do thou employ me in the kitchen!'</p><br>
<p>"Virata said, 'I do not believe, O Vallava, that cooking is thy
office. Thou resemblest the deity of a thousand eyes; and in grace
and beauty and prowess, thou shinest among these all as a
king!'</p><br>
<p>"Bhima replied, 'O king of kings, I am thy cook and servant in
the first place. It is not curries only of which I have knowledge,
O monarch, although king Yudhishthira always used in days gone by
to taste my dishes. O lord of earth, I am also a wrestler. Nor is
there one that is equal to me in strength. And engaging in fight
with lions and elephants, I shall, O sinless one, always contribute
to thy entertainment.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata said, 'I will even grant thee boons. Thou wilt do what
thou wishest, as thou describest thyself skilled in it. I do not,
however, think, that this office is worthy of thee, for thou
deservest this (entire) earth girt round by the sea. But do as thou
likest. Be thou the superintendent of my kitchen, and thou art
placed at the head of those who have been appointed there before by
me.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus appointed in the kitchen, Bhima
soon became the favourite of king Virata. And, O king, he continued
to live there unrecognised by the other servants of Virata as also
by other people!"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION IX</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Binding her black, soft, fine, long and
faultless tresses with crisped ends into a knotted braid, Draupadi
of black eyes and sweet smiles, throwing it upon her right
shoulders, concealed it by her cloth. And she wore a single piece
of a black and dirty though costly cloth. And dressing herself as a
<i>Sairindhri</i>, she began to wander hither and thither in
seeming affliction. And beholding her wandering, men and women came
to her hastily and addressed her, saying, 'Who are you? And what do
you seek?' And she replied, 'I am a king's <i>Sairindhri</i>. I
desire to serve any one that will maintain me.' But beholding her
beauty and dress, and hearing also her speech that was so sweet,
the people could not take her for a maid-servant in search of
subsistence. And it came to pass that while looking this way and
that from the terrace, Virata's beloved queen, daughter of the king
of Kekaya, saw Draupadi. And beholding her forlorn and clad in a
single piece of cloth, the queen addressed her saying, 'O beautiful
one, who are you, and what do you seek?' Thereupon, Draupadi
answered her, saying, 'O foremost of queens, I am
<i>Sairindhri</i>. I will serve anybody that will maintain me.'
Then Sudeshna said, 'What you say (regarding your profession) can
never be compatible with so much beauty. (On the contrary) you
might well be the mistress of servants both, male and female. Your
heels are not prominent, and your thighs touch each other. And your
intelligence is great, and your navel deep, and your words solemn.
And your great toes, and bust and hips, and back and sides, and
toe-nails, and palms are all well-developed. And your palms, soles,
and face are ruddy. And your speech is sweet even as the voice of
the swan. And your hair is beautiful, and your bust shapely, and
you are possessed of the highest grace. And your hips and bust are
plump. And like a Kashmerean mare you are furnished with every
auspicious mark. And your eye-lashes are (beautiful) bent, and your
nether-lip is like the ruddy ground. And your waist is slender, and
your neck bears lines that resemble those of the conch. And your
veins are scarcely visible. Indeed, your countenance is like the
full moon, and your eyes resemble the leaves of the autumnal lotus,
and your body is fragrant as the lotus itself. Verily, in beauty
you resemble <i>Sri</i> herself, whose seat is the autumnal lotus.
Tell me, O beautiful damsel, who thou art. Thou canst never be a
maidservant. Art thou a <i>Yakshi</i>, a Goddess, a
<i>Gandharvi</i>, or an <i>Apsara</i>? Art thou the daughter of a
celestial, or art thou a female <i>Naga</i>? Art thou the guardian
goddess of some city, a <i>Vidyadhari</i>, or a
<i>Kinnari</i>,?or art thou <i>Rohini</i> herself? Or art
thou Alamvusha, or Misrakesi, Pundarika, or Malini, or the queen of
Indra, or of Varuna? Or, art thou the spouse of Viswakarma, or of
the creative Lord himself? Of these goddesses who art renowned in
the celestial regions, who art thou, O graceful one?'</p><br>
<p>"Draupadi replied, 'O auspicious lady, I am neither a goddess
nor a <i>Gandharvi</i>, nor a <i>Yakshi</i>, nor a <i>Rakshasi</i>.
I am a maid-servant of the <i>Sairindhri</i> class. I tell thee
this truly. I know to dress the hair, to pound (fragrant
substances) for preparing unguents, and also to make beautiful and
variegated garlands, O beauteous lady, of jasmines and lotuses and
blue lilies and <i>Champakas</i>. Formerly I served Krishna's
favourite queen Satyabhama, and also Draupadi, the wife of the
Pandavas and the foremost beauty of the Kuru race. I wander about
alone, earning good food and dress; and as long as I get these, I
continue to live in the place where they are obtainable. Draupadi
herself called me Malini (maker of garlands).'</p><br>
<p>"Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'I would keep thee upon my head
itself, if the doubt did not cross my mind that the king himself
would be attracted towards thee with his whole heart. Attracted by
thy beauty, the females of the royal household and my maids are
looking at thee. What male person then is there that can resist thy
attraction? Surely, O thou of well-rounded hips, O damsel of
exquisite charms, beholding thy form of superhuman beauty, king
Virata is sure to forsake me, and will turn to thee with his whole
heart. O thou of faultless limbs, O thou that art endued with large
eyes casting quick glances, he upon whom thou wilt look with desire
is sure to be stricken. O thou of sweet smiles, O thou that
possessest a faultless form, he that will behold thee constantly,
will surely catch the flame. Even as a person that climbs up a tree
for compassing his own destruction, even as the crab conceives for
her own ruin, I may, O thou of sweet smiles, bring destruction upon
myself by harbouring thee.'</p><br>
<p>"Draupadi replied, 'O fair lady, neither Virata nor any other
person will be able to have me, for my five youthful husbands, who
are <i>Gandharvas</i> and sons of a <i>Gandharva</i> king of
exceeding power, always protect me. None can do me a wrong. It is
the wish of my <i>Gandharva</i> husbands that I should serve only
such persons as will not give me to touch food already partaken of
by another, or tell me to wash their feet. Any man that attempts to
have me like any common woman, meeteth with death that very night.
No one can succeed in having me, for, O beautiful lady, O thou of
sweet smiles, those beloved <i>Gandharvas</i>, possessed of great
energy and mighty strength always protect me secretly.'</p><br>
<p>"Sudeshna said, 'O thou that bringest delight to the heart, if
it is as thou sayest, I will take thee into my household. Thou
shalt not have to touch food that hath been partaken of by another,
or to wash another's feet.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Virata's wife, O
Janamejaya, Krishna (Draupadi) ever devoted to her lords, began to
live in that city. Nor could anyone ascertain who in reality she
was!"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION X</h2>
<p>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then clad in a cowherd's dress, and
speaking the dialect of cowherds, Sahadeva came to the cowpen of
Virata's city. And beholding that bull among men, who was shining
in splendour, the king was struck with amazement. And he directed
his men to summon Sahadeva. And when the latter came, the king
addressed him, saying, 'To whom dost thou belong? And whence dost
thou come? And what work dost thou seek? I have never seen thee
before. O bull among men, tell me truly about thee.'</p><br>
<p>"Having come before the king that afflicter of foes, Sahadeva
answered in accents deep as the roar of the cloud, 'I am a Vaisya,
Arishtanemi by name. I was employed as a cowherd in the service of
those bulls of the Kuru race, the sons of Pandu. O foremost of men,
I intend now to live beside thee, for I do not know where those
lions among kings, the sons of Pritha, are. I cannot live without
service, and, O king, I do not like to enter into the service of
anyone else save thee.'</p><br>
<p>"Hearing these words, Virata said, 'Thou must either be a
Brahmana or a Kshatriya. Thou lookest as if thou wert the lord of
the entire earth surrounded by the sea. Tell me truly, O thou that
mowest down thy foes. The office of a Vaisya is not fit for thee.
Tell me from the dominions of what king thou comest, and what thou
knowest, and in what capacity thou wouldst remain with us, and also
what pay thou wouldst accept.'</p><br>
<p>"Sahadeva answered, 'Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five sons
of Pandu, had one division of kine numbering eight hundred and ten
thousand, and another, ten thousand, and another, again, twenty
thousand, and so on. I was employed in keeping those cattle. People
used to call me Tantripala. I know the present, the past, and the
future of all kine living within ten <i>Yojanas</i>, and whose
<i>tale</i> has been taken. My merits were known to that
illustrious one, and the Kuru king Yudhishthira was well-pleased
with me. I am also acquainted with the means which aid kine in
multiplying within a short time, and by which they may enjoy
immunity from disease. Also these arts are known to me. I can also
single out bulls having auspicious marks for which they are
worshipped by men, and by smelling whose urine, the barren may
conceive.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata said, 'I have a hundred thousand kine divided into
distinct herds. All those together with their keepers, I place in
thy charge. Henceforth my beasts will be in thy keep.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Then, O king, undiscovered by that
monarch, that lord of men, Sahadeva, maintained by Virata, began to
live happily. Nor did anyone else (besides his brothers) recognise
him."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XI</h2>
<p>"Vaisampayana said, 'Next appeared at the gate of the ramparts
another person of enormous size and exquisite beauty decked in the
ornaments of women, and wearing large ear-rings and beautiful
conch-bracelets overlaid with gold. And that mighty-armed
individual with long and abundant hair floating about his neck,
resembled an elephant in gait. And shaking the very earth with his
tread, he approached Virata and stood in his court. And beholding
the son of the great Indra, shining with exquisite lustre and
having the gait of a mighty elephant,?that grinder of foes
having his true form concealed in disguise, entering the
council-hall and advancing towards the monarch, the king addressed
all his courtiers, saying, 'Whence doth this person come? I have
never heard of him before.' And when the men present spoke of the
newcomer as one unknown to them, the king wonderingly said,
'Possessed of great strength, thou art like unto a celestial, and
young and of darkish hue, thou resemblest the leader of a herd of
elephants. Wearing conch-bracelets overlaid with gold, a braid, and
ear-rings, thou shinest yet like one amongst those that riding on
chariots wander about equipped with mail and bow and arrows and
decked with garlands and fine hair. I am old and desirous of
relinquishing my burden. Be thou like my son, or rule thou like
myself all the Matsyas. It seemeth to me that such a person as thou
can never be of the neuter sex.'</p><br>
<p>"Arjuna said, 'I sing, dance, and play on instruments. I am
proficient in dance and skilled in song. O lord of men, assign me
unto (the princess) Uttara. I shall be dancing-master to the royal
maiden. As to how I have come by this form, what will it avail thee
to hear the account which will only augment my pain? Know me, O
king of men, to be Vrihannala, a son or daughter without father or
mother.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata said, 'O Vrihannala, I give thee what thou desirest.
Instruct my daughter, and those like her, in dancing. To me,
however, this office seemeth unworthy of thee. Thou deservest (the
dominion of) the entire earth girt round by the ocean.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "The king of the Matsyas then tested
Vrihannala in dancing, music, and other fine arts, and consulting
with his various ministers forthwith caused him to be examined by
women. And learning that this impotency was of a permanent nature,
he sent him to the maiden's apartments. And there the mighty Arjuna
began giving lessons in singing and instrumental music to the
daughter of Virata, her friends, and her waiting-maids, and soon
won their good graces. And in this manner the self-possessed Arjuna
lived there in disguise, partaking of pleasures in their company,
and unknown to the people within or without the palace."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "After a while, another powerful son of Pandu
was seen making towards king Virata in haste. And as he advanced,
he seemed to everyone like solar orb emerged from the clouds. And
he began to observe the horses around. And seeing this, the king of
the Matsyas said to his followers, 'I wonder whence this man,
possessed of the effulgence of a celestial, cometh. He looks
intently at my steeds. Verily, he must be proficient in horse-lore.
Let him be ushered into my presence quickly. He is a warrior and
looks like a god!' And that destroyer of foes then went up to the
king and accosted him, saying, 'Victory to thee, O king, and blest
be ye. As a trainer of horses, I have always been highly esteemed
by kings. I will be a clever keeper of thy horses.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata said, 'I will give thee vehicles, wealth, and spacious
quarters. Thou shalt be the manager of my horses. But first tell me
whence thou comest, who thou art, and how also thou happenest to
come here. Tell us also all the arts thou art master of.' Nakula
replied, 'O mower of enemies, know that Yudhishthira is the eldest
brother of the five sons of Pandu. I was formerly employed by him
to keep his horses. I am acquainted with the temper of steeds, and
know perfectly the art of breaking them. I know also how to correct
vicious horses, and all the methods of treating their diseases. No
animal in my hands becometh weak or ill. Not to speak of horses,
even mares in my hands will never be found to be vicious. People
called me Granthika by name and so did Yudhishthira, the son of
Pandu.'</p><br>
<p>"Virata said, 'Whatever horses I have, I consign to thy care
even from today. And all the keepers of my horses and all my
charioteers will from today be subordinate to thee. If this suits
thee, say what remuneration is desired by thee. But, O thou that
resemblest a celestial, the office of equerry is not worthy of
thee. For thou lookest like a king and I esteem thee much. The
appearance here hath pleased me as much as if Yudhishthira himself
were here. Oh, how does that blameless son of Pandu dwell and
divert himself in the forest, now destitute of servants as he
is.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "That youth, like unto a chief of the
<i>Gandharvas</i>, was treated thus respectfully by the delighted
king Virata. And he conducted himself there in such a manner as to
make himself dear and agreeable to all in the palace. And no one
recognised him while living under Virata's protection. And it was
in this manner then the sons of Pandu, the very sight of whom had
never been fruitless, continued to live in the country of the
Matsyas. And true to their pledge those lords of the earth bounded
by her belt of seas passed their days of <i>incognito</i> with
great composure notwithstanding their poignant sufferings."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XIII</h2>
<h3>(<i>Samayapalana Parva</i>)</h3>
<p>Janamejaya said, "While living thus disguised in the city of the
Matsyas, what did those descendants of the Kuru race endued with
great prowess, do, O regenerate one!"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Hear, O king, what those descendants of Kuru
did while they dwelt thus in disguise in the city of the Matsyas,
worshipping the king thereof. By the grace of the sage Trinavindu
and of the high-souled lord of justice, the Pandavas continued to
live unrecognised by others in the city of Virata. O lord of men,
Yudhishthira, as courtier made himself agreeable to Virata and his
sons as also to all the Matsyas. An adept in the mysteries of dice,
the son of Pandu caused them to play at dice according to his
pleasure and made them sit together in the dice-hall like a row of
birds bound in a string. And that tiger among men, king
Yudhishthira the Just, unknown to the monarch, distributed among
his brothers, in due proportion, the wealth he won from Virata. And
Bhimasena on his part, sold to Yudhishthira for price, meat and
viands of various kinds which he obtained from the king. And Arjuna
distributed among all his brothers the proceeds of worn-out cloths
which he earned in the inner apartments of the palace. And
Sahadeva, too, who was disguised as a cowherd gave milk, curds and
clarified butter to his brothers. And Nakula also shared with his
brothers the wealth the king gave him, satisfied with his
management of the horses. And Draupadi, herself in a pitiable
condition, looked after all those brothers and behaved in such a
way as to remain unrecognized. And thus ministering unto one
another's wants, those mighty warriors lived in the capital of
Virata as hidden from view, as if they were once more in their
mother's womb. And those lords of men, the sons of Pandu,
apprehensive of danger from the son of Dhritarashtra, continued to
dwell there in concealment, watching over their wife Draupadi. And
after three months had passed away, in the fourth, the grand
festival in honour of the divine Brahma which was celebrated with
pomp in the country of the Matsyas, came off. And there came
athletes from all quarters by thousands, like hosts of celestials
to the abode of Brahma or of Siva to witness that festival. And
they were endued with huge bodies and great prowess, like the
demons called <i>Kalakhanjas</i>. And elated with their prowess and
proud of their strength, they were highly honoured by the king. And
their shoulders and waists and necks were like those of lions, and
their bodies were very clean, and their hearts were quite at ease.
And they had many a time won success in the lists in the presence
of kings. And amongst them there was one who towered above the rest
and challenged them all to a combat. And there was none that dared
to approach him as he proudly stalked in the arena. And when all
the athletes stood sad and dispirited, the king of the Matsyas made
him fight with his cook. And urged by the king, Bhima made up his
mind reluctantly, for he could not openly disobey the royal behest.
And that tiger among men then having worshipped the king, entered
the spacious arena, pacing with the careless steps of a tiger. And
the son of Kunti then girded up his loins to the great delight of
the spectators. And Bhima then summoned to the combat that athlete
known by the name of Jimuta who was like unto the Asura Vritra
whose prowess was widely known. And both of them were possessed of
great courage, and both were endued with terrible prowess. And they
were like a couple of infuriate and huge-bodied elephants, each
sixty years old. And those brave tigers among men then cheerfully
engaged in a wrestling combat, desirous of vanquishing each other.
And terrible was the encounter that took place between them, like
the clash of the thunderbolt against the stony mountain-breast. And
both of them were exceedingly powerful and extremely delighted at
each other's strength. And desirous of vanquishing each other, each
stood eager to take advantage of his adversary's lapse. And both
were greatly delighted and both looked like infuriate elephants of
prodigious size. And various were the modes of attack and defence
that they exhibited with their clenched fists.<sup>12</sup>
And each dashed against the other and flung his adversary to a
distance. And each cast the other down and pressed him close to the
ground. And each got up again and squeezed the other in his arms.
And each threw the other violently off his place by boxing him on
the breast. And each caught the other by the legs and whirling him
round threw him down on the ground. And they slapped each other
with their palms that struck as hard as the thunderbolt. And they
also struck each other with their outstretched fingers, and
stretching them out like spears thrust the nails into each other's
body. And they gave each other violent kicks. And they struck knee
and head against head, producing the crash of one stone against
another. And in this manner that furious combat between those
warriors raged on without weapons, sustained mainly by the power of
their arms and their physical and mental energy, to the infinite
delight of the concourse of spectators. And all people, O king,
took deep interest in that encounter of those powerful wrestlers
who fought like Indra and the Asura Vritra. And they cheered both
of them with loud acclamations of applause. And the broad-chested
and long-armed experts in wrestling then pulled and pressed and
whirled and hurled down each other and struck each other with their
knees, expressing all the while their scorn for each other in loud
voices. And they began to fight with their bare arms in this way,
which were like spiked maces of iron. And at last the powerful and
mighty-armed Bhima, the slayer of his foes, shouting aloud seized
the vociferous athlete by the arms even as the lion seizes the
elephant, and taking him up from the ground and holding him aloft,
began to whirl him round, to the great astonishment of the
assembled athletes and the people of Matsya. And having whirled him
round and round a hundred times till he was insensible, the
strong-armed Vrikodara dashed him to death on the ground. And when
the brave and renowned Jimuta was thus killed, Virata and his
friends were filled with great delight. And in the exuberance of
his joy, the noble-minded king rewarded Vallava then and there with
the liberality of Kuvera. And killing numerous athletes and many
other men possessed of great bodily strength, he pleased the king
very much. And when no one could be found there to encounter him in
the lists, the king made him fight with tigers and lions and
elephants. And the king also made him battle with furious and
powerful lions in the harem for the pleasure of the ladies. And
Arjuna, too, pleased the king and all the ladies of the inner
apartments by singing and dancing. And Nakula pleased Virata, that
best of kings, by showing him fleet and well-trained steeds that
followed him wherever he went. And the king, gratified with him,
rewarded him with ample presents. And beholding around Sahadeva a
herd of well-trained bullocks, Virata that bull among men, bestowed
upon him also wealth of diverse kinds. And, O king, Draupadi
distressed to see all those warriors suffer pain, sighed
incessantly. And it was in this way that those eminent persons
lived there in disguise, rendering services unto king Virata."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XIV</h2>
<h3>(<i>Kichaka-badha Parva</i>)</h3>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Living in such disguise, those mighty
warriors, the sons of Pritha, passed ten months in Matsya's city.
And, O monarch, although herself deserving to be waited upon by
others, the daughter of Yajnasena, O Janamejaya, passed her days in
extreme misery, waiting upon Sudeshna. And residing thus in
Sudeshna's apartments, the princess of Panchala pleased that lady
as also the other females of the inner apartments. And it came to
pass that as the year was about to expire, the redoubtable Kichaka,
the Commander of Virata's forces, chanced to behold the daughter of
Drupada. And beholding that lady endued with the splendour of a
daughter of the celestials, treading the earth like a goddess,
Kichaka, afflicted with the shafts of Kama, desired to possess her.
And burning with desire's flame, Virata's general came to Sudeshna
(his sister) and smilingly addressed her in these words, 'This
beauteous lady had never before been seen by me in king Virata's
abode. This damsel maddens me with her beauty, even as a new wine
maddens one with its fragrance. Tell me, who is this graceful and
captivating lady possessed of the beauty of a goddess, and whose
she is, and whence she hath come. Surely, grinding my heart she
hath reduced me to subjection. It seems to me that (save her) there
is no other medicine for my illness. O, this fair hand-maid of
thine seemeth to me to be possessed of the beauty of a goddess.
Surely, one like her is ill suited to serve thee. Let her rule over
me and whatever is mine. O, let her grace my spacious and beautiful
palace, decked with various ornaments of gold, full of viands and
drinks in profusion, with excellent plates, and containing every
kind of plenty, besides elephants and horses and cars in myriads.'
And having consulted with Sudeshna thus, Kichaka went to princess
Draupadi, and like a jackal in the forest accosting a lioness,
spoke unto Krishna these words in a winning voice, 'Who and whose
art thou, O beautiful one? And O thou of beautiful face, whence
hast thou come to the city of Virata? Tell me all this, O fair
lady. Thy beauty and gracefulness are of the very first order and
the comeliness of thy features is unparalleled. With its loveliness
thy face shineth ever like the resplendent moon. O thou of fair
eye-brows, thy eyes are beautiful and large like lotus-petals. Thy
speech also, O thou of beautiful limbs, resembles the notes of the
<i>cuckoo</i>. O thou of fair hips, never before in this world have
I beheld a woman possessed of beauty like thine, O thou of
faultless features. Art thou Lakshmi herself having her abode in
the midst of lotuses or, art thou, O slender-waisted one, she who
is called <i>Bhuti</i><sup>13</sup>. Or,
which amongst these?<i>Hri, Sri, Kirti</i> and
<i>Kanti</i>,?art thou, O thou of beautiful face? Or
possessed of beauty like Rati's, art thou, she who sporteth in the
embraces of the God of love? O thou that possessest the fairest of
eye-brows, thou shinest beautifully even like the lovely light of
the moon. Who is there in the whole world that will not succumb to
the influence of desire beholding thy face? Endued with unrivalled
beauty and celestial grace of the most attractive kind, that face
of thine is even like the full moon, its celestial effulgence
resembling his radiant face, its smile resembling his soft-light,
and its eye-lashes looking like the spokes on his disc. Both thy
bosoms, so beautiful and well-developed and endued with unrivalled
gracefulness and deep and well-rounded and without any space
between them, are certainly worthy of being decked with garlands of
gold. Resembling in shape the beautiful buds of the lotus, these
thy breasts, O thou of fair eye-brows, are even as the whips of
Kama that are urging me forward, O thou of sweet smiles. O damsel
of slender waist, beholding that waist of thine marked with four
wrinkles and measuring but a span, and slightly stooping forward
because of the weight of thy breasts, and also looking on those
graceful hips of thine broad as the banks of a river, the incurable
fever of desire, O beauteous lady, afflicteth me sore. The flaming
fire of desire, fierce as a forest conflagration, and fanned by the
hope my heart cherisheth of a union with thee is consuming me
intensely. O thou of exceeding beauty quench thou that flaming fire
kindled by Manmatha. Union with thee is a rain-charged cloud, and
the surrender of thy person is the shower that the cloud may drop.
O thou of face resembling the moon, the fierce and maddening shafts
of Manmatha whetted and sharpened by the desire of a union with
thee, piercing this heart of mine in their impetuous course, have
penetrated into its core. O black-eyed lady, those impetuous and
cruel shafts are maddening me beyond endurance. It behoveth thee to
relieve me from this plight by surrendering thyself to me and
favouring me with thy embraces. Decked in beautiful garlands and
robes and adorned with every ornament, sport thou, O sweet damsel,
with me to thy fill. O thou of the gait of an elephant in rut,
deserving as thou art of happiness though deprived of it now, it
behoveth thee not to dwell here in misery. Let unrivalled weal be
thine. Drinking various kinds of charming and delicious and
ambrosial wines, and sporting at thy pleasure in the enjoyment of
diverse objects of delight, do thou, O blessed lady, attain
auspicious prosperity. This beauty of thine and this prime of thy
youth, O sweet lady, are now without their use. For, O beauteous
and chaste damsel, endued with such loveliness, thou dost not
shine, like a graceful garland lying unused and unworn. I will
forsake all my old wives. Let them, O thou of sweet smiles, become
thy slaves. And I also, O fair damsel, will stay by thee as thy
slave, ever obedient to thee, O thou of the most handsome face.'
Hearing these words of his, Draupadi replied, 'In desiring me, a
female servant of low extraction, employed in the despicable office
of dressing hair, O <i>Suta's</i> son, thou desirest one that
deserves not that honour. Then, again, I am the wife of others.
Therefore, good betide thee, this conduct of thine is not proper.
Do thou remember the precept of morality, viz., that persons should
take delight only in their wedded wives. Thou shouldst not,
therefore, by any means bend thy heart to adultery. Surely
abstaining from improper acts is ever the study of those that are
good. Overcome by ignorance sinful men under the influence of
desire come by either extreme infamy or dreadful calamity.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by the
<i>Sairindhri</i>, the wicked Kichaka losing control over his
senses and overcome by lust, although aware of the numerous evils
of fornication, evils condemned by everybody and sometimes leading
to the destruction of life itself,?then spoke unto Draupadi,
'It behoveth thee not, O beauteous lady, O thou of graceful
features, thus to disregard me who am, O thou of sweet smiles,
under the power of Manmatha on thy account. If now, O timid one,
thou disregardest me who am under thy influence and who speak to
thee so fair, thou wilt, O black-eyed damsel, have to repent for it
afterwards. O thou of graceful eye-brows, the real lord of this
entire kingdom, O slender-waisted lady, is myself. It is me
depending upon whom the people of this realm live. In energy and
prowess I am unrivalled on earth. There is no other man on earth
who rivals me in beauty of person, in youth, in prosperity, and in
the possession of excellent objects of enjoyment. Why it is, O
auspicious lady, that having it in thy power to enjoy here every
object of desire and every luxury and comfort without its equal,
thou preferest servitude. Becoming the mistress of this kingdom
which I shall confer on thee, O thou of fair face, accept me, and
enjoy, O beauteous one, all excellent objects of desire.' Addressed
in these accursed words by Kichaka, that chaste daughter of Drupada
answered him thus reprovingly, 'Do not, O son of a <i>Suta</i>, act
so foolishly and do not throw away thy life. Know that I am
protected by my five husbands. Thou canst not have me. I have
Gandharvas for my husbands. Enraged they will slay thee. Therefore,
do thou not bring destruction on thyself. Thou intendest to tread
along a path that is incapable of being trod by men. Thou, O wicked
one, art even like a foolish child that standing on one shore of
the ocean intends to cross over to the other. Even if thou enterest
into the interior of the earth, or soarest into the sky, or rushest
to the other shore of the ocean, still thou wilt have no escape
from the hands of those sky-ranging offspring of gods, capable of
grinding all foes. Why dost thou today, O Kichaka, solicit me so
persistently even as a sick person wisheth for the night that will
put a stop to his existence? Why dost thou desire me, even like an
infant lying on its mother's lap wishing to catch the moon? For
thee that thus solicitest their beloved wife, there is no refuge
either on earth or in sky. O Kichaka, hast thou no sense which
leads thee to seek thy good and by which thy life may be
saved?'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XV</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Rejected thus by the princess, Kichaka,
afflicted with maddening lust and forgetting all sense of
propriety, addressed Sudeshna saying, 'Do thou, Kekaya's daughter,
so act that thy <i>Sairindhri</i> may come into my arms. Do thou, O
Sudeshna, adopt the means by which the damsel of the gait of an
elephant may accept me; I am dying of absorbing desire.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing his profuse lamentations, that
gentle lady, the intelligent queen of Virata, was touched with
pity. And having taken counsel with her own self and reflected on
Kichaka's purpose and on the anxiety of Krishna, Sudeshna addressed
the <i>Suta's</i> son in these words, 'Do thou, on the occasion of
some festival, procure viands and wines for me. I shall then send
my <i>Sairindhri</i> to thee on the pretence of bringing wine. And
when she will repair thither do thou in solitude, free from
interruption, humour her as thou likest. Thus soothed, she may
incline her mind to thee.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, he went out of his
sister's apartments. And he soon procured wines well-filtered and
worthy of a king. And employing skilled cooks, he prepared many and
various kinds of choice viands and delicious drinks and many and
various kinds of meat of different degrees of excellence. And when
all this had been done, that gentle lady Sudeshna, as previously
counselled by Kichaka, desired her <i>Sairindhri</i> to repair to
Kichaka's abode, saying, 'Get up, O <i>Sairindhri</i> and repair to
Kichaka's abode to bring wine, for, O beauteous lady, I am
afflicted with thirst.' Thereupon the <i>Sairindhri</i> replied, 'O
princess, I shall not be able to repair to Kichaka's apartments.
Thou thyself knowest, O queen, how shameless he is. O thou of
faultless limbs, O beauteous lady, in thy palace I shall not be
able to lead a lustful life, becoming faithless to my husbands.
Thou rememberest, O gentle lady, O beautiful one, the conditions I
had set down before entering thy house. O thou of tresses ending in
graceful curls, the foolish Kichaka afflicted by the god of desire,
will, on seeing me, offer me insult. Therefore, I will not go to
his quarters. Thou hast, O princess, many maids under thee. Do
thou, good betide thee, send one of them. For, surely, Kichaka will
insult me.' Sudeshna said, 'Sent by me, from my abode, surely he
will not harm thee.' And having said this, she handed over a golden
vessel furnished with a cover. And filled with apprehension, and
weeping, Draupadi mentally prayed for the protection of the gods,
and set out for Kichaka's abode for fetching wine. And she said,
'As I do not know another person save my husbands, by virtue of
that Truth let Kichaka not be able to overpower me although I may
approach his presence.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "And that helpless damsel then adored
Surya for a moment. And Surya, having considered all that she
urged, commanded a <i>Rakshasa</i> to protect her invisibly. And
from that time the <i>Rakshasa</i> began to attend upon that
blameless lady under any circumstances. And beholding Krishna in
his presence like a frightened doe, the <i>Suta</i> rose up from
his seat, and felt the joy that is felt by a person wishing to
cross to the other shore, when he obtains a boat."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XVI</h2>
<p>"Kichaka said, 'O thou of tresses ending in beautiful curls,
thou art welcome. Surely, the night that is gone hath brought me an
auspicious day, for I have got thee today as the mistress of my
house. Do what is agreeable to me. Let golden chains, and conchs
and bright ear-rings made of gold, manufactured in various
countries, and beautiful rubies and gems, and silken robes and
deer-skins, be brought for thee. I have also an excellent bed
prepared for thee. Come, sitting upon it do thou drink with me the
wine prepared from the honey flower.' Hearing these words, Draupadi
said, 'I have been sent to thee by the princess for taking away
wine. Do thou speedily bring me wine, for she told me that she is
exceedingly thirsty.' At this, Kichaka said, 'O gentle lady, others
will carry what the princess wants.' And saying this, the
<i>Suta's</i> son caught hold of Draupadi's right arm. And at this,
Draupadi exclaimed, 'As I have never, from intoxication of the
senses, been unfaithful to my husbands even at heart, by that
Truth, O wretch, I shall behold thee dragged and lying powerless on
the ground.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Seeing that large-eyed lady reproving
him in that strain, Kichaka suddenly seized her by the end of her
upper garment as she attempted to run away. And seized with
violence by Kichaka, the beautiful princess, unable to tolerate it,
and with frame trembling with wrath, and breathing quickly, dashed
him to the ground. And dashed to the ground thus, the sinful wretch
tumbled down like a tree whose roots had been cut. And having
thrown Kichaka down on the ground when the latter had seized her,
she, trembling all over rushed to the court, where king
Yudhishthira was, for protection. And while she was running with
all her speed, Kichaka (who followed her), seizing her by the hair,
and bringing her down on the ground, kicked her in the very
presence of the king. Thereupon, O Bharata, the <i>Rakshasa</i>
that had been appointed by Surya to protect Draupadi, gave Kichaka
a shove with a force mighty as that of the wind. And overpowered by
the force of <i>Rakshasa</i>, Kichaka reeled and fell down
senseless on the ground, even like an uprooted tree. And both
Yudhishthira and Bhimasena who were seated there, beheld with
wrathful eyes that outrage on Krishna by Kichaka. And desirous of
compassing the destruction of the wicked Kichaka, the illustrious
Bhima gnashed his teeth in rage. And his forehead was covered with
sweat, and terrible wrinkles appeared thereon. And a smoky
exhalation shot forth from his eyes, and his eye-lashes stood on
end. And that slayer of hostile heroes pressed his forehead with
his hands. And impelled by rage, he was on the point of starting up
with speed. Thereat king Yudhishthira, apprehensive of discovery,
squeezed his thumbs and commanded Bhima to forbear. And Bhima who
then looked like an infuriate elephant eyeing a large tree, was
thus forbidden by his elder brother. And the latter said, 'Lookest
thou, O cook, for trees for fuel. If thou art in need of faggots,
then go out and fell trees.' And the weeping Draupadi of fair hips,
approaching the entrance of the court, and seeing her melancholy
lords, desirous yet of keeping up the disguise duty-bound by their
pledge, with eyes burning in fire, spoke these words unto the king
of the Matsyas, 'Alas, the son of a <i>Suta</i> hath kicked today
the proud and beloved wife of those whose foe can never sleep in
peace even if four kingdoms intervene between him and them. Alas,
the son of a <i>Suta</i> hath kicked today the proud and beloved
wife of those truthful personages, who are devoted to Brahmanas and
who always give away without asking any thing in gift. Alas! the
son of a <i>Suta</i> hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife
of those, the sounds of whose kettle-drums and the twangs of whose
bow-strings are ceaselessly heard. Alas, the son of a <i>Suta</i>
hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those who are
possessed of abundant energy and might, and who are liberal in
gifts and proud of their dignity. Alas, the son of a <i>Suta</i>
hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those who, if they
had not been fettered by the ties of duty, could destroy this
entire world. Where, alas, are those mighty warriors today who,
though living in disguise, have always granted protection unto
those that solicit it? Oh, why do those heroes today, endued as
they are with strength and possessed of immeasurable energy,
quietly suffer, like eunuchs, their dear and chaste wife to be thus
insulted by a <i>Suta's</i> son? Oh, where is that wrath of theirs,
that prowess, and that energy, when they quietly bear their wife to
be thus insulted by a wicked wretch? What can I (a weak woman) do
when Virata, deficient in virtue, coolly suffereth my innocent self
to be thus wronged by a wretch? Thou dost not, O king, act like a
king towards this Kichaka. Thy behaviour is like that of a robber,
and doth not shine in a court. That I should thus be insulted in
thy very presence, O Matsya, is highly improper. Oh, let all the
courtiers here look at this violence of Kichaka. Kichaka is
ignorant of duty and morality, and Matsya also is equally so. These
courtiers also that wait upon such a king are destitute of
virtue.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "With these and other words of the same
kind the beautiful Krishna with tearful eyes rebuked the king of
the Matsyas. And hearing her, Virata said, 'I do not know what your
dispute has been out of our sight. Not knowing the true cause how
can I show my discrimination?' Then the courtiers, having learnt
every thing, applauded Krishna, and they all exclaimed, 'Well
done!' 'Well done!' and censured Kichaka. And the courtiers said,
'That person who owneth this large-eyed lady having every limb of
hers endued with beauty for his wife, possesseth what is of
exceeding value and hath no occasion to indulge in any grief.
Surely, such a damsel of transcendent beauty and limbs perfectly
faultless is rare among men. Indeed, it seems to us that she is a
goddess.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "And while the courtiers, having beheld
Krishna (under such circumstances), were applauding her thus,
Yudhishthira's forehead, from ire, became covered with sweat. And
that bull of the Kuru race then addressed that princess, his
beloved spouse, saying, 'Stay not here, O Sairindhri; but retire to
the apartments of Sudeshna. The wives of heroes bear affliction for
the sake of their husbands, and undergoing toil in ministering unto
their lords, they at last attain to region where their husbands may
go. Thy Gandharva husbands, effulgent as the sun, do not, I
imagine, consider this as an occasion for manifesting their wrath,
inasmuch as they do not rush to thy aid. O <i>Sairindhri</i>, thou
art ignorant of the timeliness of things, and it is for this that
thou weepest as an actress, besides interrupting the play of dice
in Matsya's court. Retire, O <i>Sairindhri</i>; the Gandharvas will
do what is agreeable to thee. And they will surely display thy woe
and take the life of him that hath wronged thee.' Hearing these
words the <i>Sairindhri</i> replied, 'They of whom I am the wedded
wife are, I ween, extremely kind. And as the eldest of them all is
addicted to dice, they are liable to be oppressed by all.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "And having said this, the fair-hipped
Krishna with dishevelled hair and eyes red in anger, ran towards
the apartments of Sudeshna. And in consequence of having wept long
her face looked beautiful like the lunar disc in the firmament,
emerged from the clouds. And beholding her in that condition,
Sudeshna asked, 'Who, O beauteous lady, hath insulted thee? Why, O
amiable damsel, dost thou weep? Who, gentle one, hath done thee
wrong? Whence is this thy grief?' Thus addressed, Draupadi said,
'As I went to bring wine for thee, Kichaka struck me in the court
in the very presence of the king, as if in the midst of a solitary
wood.' Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'O thou of tresses ending in
beautiful curls, as Kichaka, maddened by lust hath insulted thee
that art incapable of being possessed by him, I shall cause him to
be slain if thou wishest it.' Thereupon Draupadi answered, 'Even
others will slay him,?even they whom he hath wronged. I think
it is clear that he will have to go to the abode of Yama this very
day!'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XVII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Thus insulted by the <i>Suta's</i> son, that
illustrious princess, the beautiful Krishna, eagerly wishing for
the destruction of Virata's general, went to her quarters. And
Drupada's daughter of dark hue and slender waist then performed her
ablutions. And washing her body and cloths with water Krishna began
to ponder weepingly on the means of dispelling her grief. And she
reflected, saying, 'What am I to do? Whither shall I go? How can my
purpose be effected?' And while she was thinking thus, she
remembered Bhima and said to herself, 'There is none else, save
Bhima, that can today accomplish the purpose on which my heart is
set!' And afflicted with great grief, the large-eyed and
intelligent Krishna possessed of powerful protectors then rose up
at night, and leaving her bed speedily proceeded towards the
quarters of Bhimasena, desirous of beholding her lord. And
possessed of great intelligence, the daughter of Drupada entered
her husband's quarters, saying, 'How canst thou sleep while that
wretched commander of Virata's forces, who is my foe, yet liveth,
having perpetrated today <i>that</i> (foul act)?'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Then the chamber where Bhima slept,
breathing hard like a lion, being filled with the beauty of
Drupada's daughter and of the high-souled Bhima, blazed forth in
splendour. And Krishna of sweet smiles, finding Bhimasena in the
cooking apartments, approached him with the eagerness of a
three-year old cow brought up in the woods, approaching a powerful
bull, in her first season, or of a she-crane living by the
water-side approaching her mate in the pairing season. And the
Princess of Panchala then embraced the second son of Pandu, even as
a creeper embraces a huge and mighty <i>Sala</i> on the banks of
the Gomati. And embracing him with her arms, Krishna of faultless
features awaked him as a lioness awaketh a sleeping lion in a
trackless forest. And embracing Bhimasena even as a she-elephant
embraceth her mighty mate, the faultless Panchali addressed him in
voice sweet as the sound of a stringed instrument emitting
<i>Gandhara</i> note. And she said, 'Arise, arise! Why dost thou, O
Bhimasena, lie down as one dead? Surely, he that is not dead, never
suffereth a wicked wretch that hath disgraced his wife, to live.'
And awakened by the princess, Bhima of mighty arms, then rose up,
and sat upon his couch overlaid with a rich bed. And he of the Kuru
race then addressed the princess?his beloved wife, saying,
'For what purpose hast thou come hither in such a hurry? Thy colour
is gone and thou lookest lean and pale. Tell me everything in
detail. I must know the truth. Whether it be pleasurable or
painful, agreeable, or disagreeable, tell me all. Having heard
everything, I shall apply the remedy. I alone, O Krishna, am
entitled to thy confidence in all things, for it is I who deliver
thee from perils again and again! Tell me quickly what is thy wish,
and what is the purpose that is in thy view, and return thou to thy
bed before others awake.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XVIII</h2>
<p>"Draupadi said, 'What grief hath she not who hath Yudhishthira
for her husband? Knowing all my griefs, why dost thou ask me? The
<i>Pratikamin</i> dragged me to the court in the midst of an
assembly of courtiers, calling me a slave. That grief, O Bharata,
consumeth me. What other princess, save Draupadi, would live having
suffered such intense misery? Who else, save myself, could bear
such second insult as the wicked Saindhava offered me while
residing in the forest? Who else of my position, save myself, could
live, having been kicked by Kichaka in the very sight of the wicked
king of the Matsyas? Of what value is life, O Bharata, when thou, O
son of Kunti, dost not think me miserable, although I am afflicted
with such woes? That vile and wicked wretch, O Bharata, known by
the name of Kichaka, who is the brother-in-law of king Virata and
the commander of his forces, every day, O tiger among men,
addresses me who am residing in the palace as a <i>Sairindhri</i>,
saying, <i>Do thou become my wife</i>.?Thus solicited, O
slayer of foes, by that wretch deserving to be slain, my heart is
bursting like a fruit ripened in season. Censure thou that elder
brother of thine addicted to execrable dice, through whose act
alone I have been afflicted with such woe. Who else, save him that
is a desperate gambler, would play, giving up kingdom and
everything including even myself, in order to lead a life in the
woods? If he had gambled morning and evening for many years
together, staking <i>nishkas</i> by thousand and other kinds of
substantial wealth, still his silver, and gold, and robes, and
vehicles, and teams, and goats, and sheep, and multitudes of steeds
and mares and mules would not have sustained any diminution. But
now deprived of prosperity by the rivalry of dice, he sits dumb
like a fool, reflecting on his own misdeeds. Alas, he who, while
sojourning, was followed by ten thousand elephants adorned with
golden garlands now supports himself by casting dice. That
Yudhishthira who at Indraprastha was adored by kings of
incomparable prowess by hundreds of thousands, that mighty monarch
in whose kitchen a hundred thousand maid-servants, plate in hand,
used every day to feed numerous guests day and night, that best of
liberal men, who gave (every day) a thousand <i>nishkas</i>, alas,
even he overwhelmed with woe in consequence of gambling which is
the root of all evil, now supporteth himself by casting dice. Bards
and encomiasts by thousands decked with ear-rings set with
brilliant gems, and gifted with melodious voice, used to pay him
homage morning and evening. Alas, that Yudhishthira, who was daily
waited upon by a thousand sages of ascetic merit, versed in the
<i>Vedas</i> and having every desire gratified, as his
courtiers,?that Yudhishthira who maintained eighty-eight
thousands of domestic <i>Snatakas</i> with thirty maid-servants
assigned unto each, as also ten thousand <i>yatis</i> not accepting
anything in gift and with vital seed drawn up,?alas, even
that mighty king now liveth in such guise. That Yudhishthira who is
without malice, who is full of kindness, and who giveth every
creature his due, who hath all these excellent attributes,
alas?even he now liveth in such guise. Possessed of firmness
and unbaffled prowess, with heart disposed to give every creature
his due, king Yudhishthira, moved by compassion, constantly
maintained in his kingdom the blind, the old, the helpless, the
parentless and all others in his dominions in such distress. Alas,
that Yudhishthira becoming a dependant and a servant of Matsya, a
caster of dice in his court, now calls himself Kanka. He unto whom
while residing at Indraprastha, all the rulers of earth used to pay
timely tribute,?alas, even he now begs for subsistence at
another's hands. He to whom the kings of the earth were in
subjection,?alas, even that king having lost his liberty,
liveth in subjection to others. Having dazzled the entire earth
like the sun by his energy, that Yudhishthira, alas, is now a
courtier of king Virata. O Pandu's son, that Pandava who was
respectfully waited upon in court by kings and sages, behold him
now waiting upon another. Alas, beholding Yudhishthira a courtier
sitting beside another and breathing adulatory speeches to the
other, who can help being afflicted with grief? And beholding the
highly wise and virtuous Yudhishthira, undeserving as he is of
serving others, actually serving another for sustenance, who can
help being afflicted with grief? And, O hero, that Bharata who was
worshipped in court by the entire earth, do thou now behold him
worshipping another. Why then, O Bharata, dost thou not regard me
as one afflicted with diverse miseries, like one forlorn and
immersed in a sea of sorrow?'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XIX</h2>
<p>"Draupadi said, 'This O Bharata, that I am going to tell thee is
another great grief of mine. Thou shouldst not blame me, for I tell
thee this from sadness of heart. Who is there whose grief is not
enhanced at sight of thee, O bull of the Bharata race, engaged in
the ignoble office of a cook, so entirely beneath thee and calling
thyself as one <i>of Vallava</i> caste? What can be sadder than
this, that people should know thee as Virata's cook, Vallava by
name, and therefore one that is sunk in servitude? Alas, when thy
work of the kitchen is over, thou humbly sittest beside Virata,
calling thyself as Vallava the cook, then despondency seizeth my
heart. When the king of kings in joy maketh thee fight with
elephants, and the women of the inner apartments (of the palace)
laugh all the while, then I am sorely distressed. When thou
fightest in the inner apartments with lions, tigers, and buffaloes,
the princess Kaikeyi looking on, then I almost swoon away. And when
Kaikeyi and those maidservants, leaving their seats, come to assist
me and find that instead of suffering any injury in limbs mine is
only a swoon, the princess speaks unto her women, saying, 'Surely,
it is from affection and the duty begot of intercourse that this
lady of sweet smiles grieveth for the exceedingly powerful cook
when he fights with the beasts. Sairindhri is possessed of great
beauty and Vallava also is eminently handsome. The heart of woman
is hard to know, and they, I fancy, are deserving of each other. It
is, therefore, likely that the Sairindhri invariably weepeth (at
such times) on account of her connection with her lover. And then,
they both have entered this royal family at the same time. And
speaking such words she always upbraideth me. And beholding me
wroth at this, she suspects me to be attached to thee.' When she
speaketh thus, great is the grief that I feel. Indeed, on beholding
thee, O Bhima of terrible prowess, afflicted with such calamity,
sunk as I already am in grief on account of Yudhishthira, I do not
desire to live. That youth who on a single car had vanquished all
celestials and men, is now, alas, the dancing master of king
Virata's daughter. That Pritha's son of immeasurable soul, who had
gratified Agni in the forest of Khandava, is now living in the
inner apartments (of a palace) like fire hid in a well. Alas, the
bull among men, Dhananjaya, who was ever the terror of foes, is now
living in a guise that is despaired by all. Alas, he whose
mace-like arms have been cicatrized in consequence of the strokes
of his bow-string, alas that Dhananjaya is passing the days in
grief covering his wrists with bracelets of conchs. Alas, that
Dhananjaya the twang of whose bow-string and the sound of whose
leathern fences made every foe tremble, now entertains only
gladdened women with his songs. Oh, that Dhananjaya whose head was
formerly decked with a diadem of solar splendour, is now wearing
braids ending in unsightly curls. O Bhima, beholding that terrible
bowman, Arjuna, now wearing braids and in the midst of women, my
heart is stricken with woe. That high-souled hero who is master of
all the celestial weapons, and who is the repository of all the
sciences, now weareth ear-rings (like one of the fair sex). That
youth whom kings of incomparable prowess could not overpower in
fight, even as the waters of the mighty ocean cannot overleap the
continents, is now the dancing-master of king Virata's daughters
and waits upon them in disguise. O Bhima, that Arjuna the clatter
of whose car-wheels caused the entire earth with her mountains and
forests, her mobile and immobile things to tremble, and whose birth
dispelled all the sorrows of Kunti, that exalted hero, that younger
brother of thine, O Bhimasena, now maketh me weep for him.
Beholding him coming towards me, decked in golden ear-rings and
other ornaments, and wearing on the wrists bracelets of conchs, my
heart is afflicted with despondency. And Dhananjaya who hath not a
bowman equal unto him on earth in prowess, now passeth his days in
singing, surrounded by women. Beholding that son of Pritha who in
virtue, heroism and truth, was the most admired in the world, now
living in the guise of a woman, my heart is afflicted with sorrow.
When I behold, the godlike Partha in the music-hall like an
elephant with rent temples surrounded by she-elephants in the midst
of females, waiting before Virata the king of the Matsyas, then I
lose all sense of directions. Surely, my mother-in-law doth not
know Dhananjaya to be afflicted with such extreme distress. Nor
doth she know that descendant of the Kuru race, Ajatasatru,
addicted to disastrous dice, to be sunk in misery. O Bharata,
beholding the youngest of you all, Sahadeva, superintending the
kine, in the guise of a cowherd, I grow pale. Always thinking of
Sahadeva's plight, I cannot, O Bhimasena, obtain sleep,?what
to speak you of the rest? I do not know, O mighty-armed one, what
sin Sahadeva may have committed for which that hero of unbaffled
prowess suffereth such misery. O foremost of the Bharatas,
beholding that beloved brother of thine, that bull among men,
employed by Matsya in looking after his kine, I am filled with woe.
Seeing that hero of proud disposition gratifying Virata, by living
at the head of his cowherds, attired in robes dyed in red, I am
attacked with fever. My mother-in-law always applauds the heroic
Sahadeva as one possessed of nobility, excellent behaviour, and
rectitude of conduct. Ardently attached to her sons, the weeping
Kunti stood, embracing Sahadeva while he was about to set out (with
us) for the great forest. And she addressed me saying, "Sahadeva is
bashful and sweet-speeched, and virtuous. He is also my favourite
child. Therefore, O Yajnaseni, tend him in the forest day and
night. Delicate and brave, devoted to the king, and always
worshipping his elder brother, do thou, O Panchali, feed him
thyself." O Pandava, beholding that foremost of warriors, Sahadeva,
engaged in tending kine, and sleeping at night on calf-skins, how
can I bear to live? He again who is crowned with the three
attributes of beauty, arms, and intelligence, is now the
superintendent of Virata's steeds. Behold the change brought on by
time. Granthika (Nakula), at sight of whom hostile hosts fled from
the field of battle, now traineth horses in the presence of the
king, driving them with the speed. Alas, I now see that handsome
youth wait upon the gorgeously decked and excellent Virata, the
king of the Matsyas, and display horses before him. O son of
Pritha, afflicted as I am with all these hundred kinds of misery on
account of Yudhishthira, why dost thou, O chastiser of foes, yet
deem me happy? Listen now to me, O son of Kunti, as I tell thee of
other woes far surpassing these. What can be sadder to me than
miseries so various as these should emaciate me while ye are
alive.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XX</h2>
<p>"Draupadi said, 'Alas, on account of that desperate gambler, I
am now under Sudeshna's command, living in the palace in the guise
of a <i>Sairindhri</i>. And, O chastiser of foes, behold the plight
of poignant woe which I, a princess, am now in. I am living in
expectation of the close of this stated period.<sup>14</sup> The extreme of misery, therefore,
is mine. Success of purpose, victory, and defeat, as regards
mortals, are transitory. It is in this belief that I am living in
expectation of the return of prosperity to my husbands. Prosperity
and adversity revolve like a wheel. It is in this belief that I am
living in expectation of the return of prosperity to my husbands.
That cause which bringeth on victory, may bring defeat as well. I
live in this hope. Why dost thou not, O Bhimasena, regard me as one
dead? I have heard that persons that give may beg: that they who
slay may be slain; and that they who over-throw others may
themselves be overthrown by foes. Nothing is difficult for Destiny
and none can over-ride Destiny. It is for this that I am awaiting
the return of favourable fortune. As a tank once dried, is filled
up once again, so hoping for a change for the better, I await the
return of prosperity. When one's business that hath been
well-provided for is seen to be frustrated, a truly wise person
should never strive for bringing back good fortune. Plunged as I am
an sorrow, asked or unasked by thee to explain the purpose of these
words spoken by me, I shall tell thee everything. Queen of the sons
of Pandu and daughter of Drupada, who else, save myself, would wish
to live, having fallen into such a plight? O represser of foes, the
misery, therefore, that hath overtaken me, hath really humiliated
the entire <i>Kuru</i> race, the Panchalas, and the sons of Pandu.
Surrounded by numerous brothers and father-in-law and sons, what
other woman having such cause for joy, save myself, would be
afflicted with such woe? Surely, I must, in my childhood, have
committed act highly offensive to <i>Dhatri</i> through whose
displeasure, O bull of the Bharata race, I have been visited with
such consequences. Mark, O son of Pandu, the pallour that hath come
over my complexion which not even a life in the woods fraught as it
was with extreme misery, could bring about. Thou, O Pritha's son,
knowest what happiness, O Bhima, was formerly mine. Even I, who was
such have now sunk into servitude. Sorely distressed, I can find no
rest. That the mighty-armed and terrible bowman, Dhananjaya the son
of Pritha, should now live like a fire that hath been put out,
maketh me think of all this as attributable to Destiny. Surely, O
son of Pritha, it is impossible for men to understand the destinies
of creatures (in this world). I, therefore, think this downfall of
yours as something that could not be averted by forethought. Alas,
she who hath you all, that resemble Indra himself to attend to her
comforts?even she, so chaste and exalted, hath now to attend
to the comforts of others, that are to her far inferior in rank.
Behold, O Pandava, my plight. It is what I do not deserve. You are
alive, yet behold this inversion of order that time hath brought.
She who had the whole Earth to the verge of the sea under her
control, is now under the control of Sudeshna and living in fear of
her. She who had dependants to walk both before and behind her,
alas, now herself walketh before and behind Sudeshna. This, O
Kaunteya, is another grief of mine that is intolerable. O, listen
to it. She who had never, save for Kunti, pounded unguents even for
her own use, now, good betide thee, poundeth sandal (for others). O
Kaunteya, behold these hands of mine which were not so before.'
Saying this she showed him her hands marked with corns. And she
continued, 'she who had never feared Kunti herself nor thee and thy
brothers, now standeth in fear before Virata as a slave, anxious of
what that king of kings may say unto her regarding the proper
preparation of the unguents, for Matsya liketh not sandal pounded
by others.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Relating her woes thus, O Bharata, unto
Bhimasena, Krishna began to weep silently, casting her eyes on
Bhima. And then, with words choked in tears, and sighing
repeatedly, she addressed Bhima in these words, powerfully stirring
his heart, 'Signal, O Bhima, must have been my offence of old unto
the gods, for, unfortunate as I am. I am yet alive, when, O
Pandava, I should die.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Then that slayer of hostile heroes,
Vrikodara, covering his face with those delicate hands of his wife
marked with corns, began to weep. And that mighty son of Kunti,
holding the hands of Draupadi in his, shed copious tears. And
afflicted with great woe, he spoke these words."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXI</h2>
<p>"Bhima said, 'Fie on the might of my arms and fie on the
<i>Gandiva</i> of Phalguna, inasmuch as thy hands, red before, now
become covered with corns. I would have caused a carnage in
Virata's court but for the fact that Kunti's son eyed me (by way of
forbidding it), or like a mighty elephant, I would, without ado,
have crushed the head of Kichaka intoxicated with the pride of
sovereignty. When, O Krishna, I beheld thee kicked by Kichaka, I
conceived at that instant a wholesale slaughter of the Matsyas.
Yudhishthira, however, forbade me by a glance, and, O beauteous
lady, understanding his intention I have kept quiet. That we have
been deprived of our kingdom, that I have not yet slain the Kurus,
that I have not yet taken the heads of Suyodhana and Karna, and
Suvala's son Sakuni, and the wicked Duhsasana, these acts and
omissions, O lady, are consuming every limb of mine. The thought of
those abides in my heart like a javelin implanted in it. O thou of
graceful hips, do not sacrifice virtue, and, O noble-hearted lady,
subdue thy wrath. If king Yudhishthira hear from thee such rebukes,
he will surely put an end to his life. If also Dhananjaya and the
twins hear thee speak thus, even they will renounce life. And if
these, O slender-waisted maiden, give up life, I also shall not be
able to bear my own. In olden days Sarjati's daughter, the
beautiful Sukanya, followed into the forest Chyavana of Bhrigu's
race, whose mind was under complete control, and over whom, while
engaged in ascetic meditation, the ants had built a hill. Thou
mayst have heard that Indrasena also who in beauty was like unto
<i>Narayani</i> herself, followed her husband aged a thousand
years. Thou mayst have heard that Janaka's daughter Sita, the
princess of Videha, followed her lord while living in dense woods.
And that lady of graceful hips, Rama's beloved wife, afflicted with
calamities and persecuted by the Rakshasas, at length regained the
company of Rama. Lopamudra also, O timid one, endued with youth and
beauty, followed Agastya, renouncing all the objects of enjoyment
unattainable by men. And the intelligent and faultless Savitri also
followed the heroic Satyavan, the son of Dyumatsena, alone into the
world of Yama. Even like these chaste and beautiful ladies that I
have named, thou, O blessed girl, bloomest with every virtue. Do
thou spend a short while more that is measured by even a half
month. And when the thirteenth year is complete, thou wilt (again)
become the Queen regnant of a king.' Hearing these words, Draupadi
said, 'Unable, O Bhima, to bear my griefs, it is from grief alone
that I have shed these tears. I do not censure Yudhishthira. Nor is
there any use in dwelling on the past. O Bhima of mighty strength,
come quickly forward to the work of the hour. O Bhima, Kaikeyi,
jealous of my beauty, always pains me by her endeavours to prevent
the king from taking a fancy to me. And understanding this
disposition of hers, the wicked-souled Kichaka of immoral ways
constantly solicits me himself. Angry with him for this, but then
suppressing my wrath I answer that wretch deprived of sense by
lust, saying, "O Kichaka, protect thyself. I am the beloved queen
and wife of five Gandharvas. Those heroes in wrath will slay thee
that art so rash." Thus addressed, Kichaka of wicked soul replied
unto me, saying, "I have not the least fear of the Gandharvas, O
Sairindhri of sweet smiles. I will slay hundred thousand
Gandharvas, encountering them in battle. Therefore, O timid one, do
thou consent." Hearing all this, I again addressed the
lust-afflicted Suta, saying, "Thou art no match for those
illustrious Gandharvas. Of respectable percentage and good
disposition, I ever adhere to virtue and never wish for the death
of any one. It is for this that thou I vest, O Kichaka!" At this,
that wight of wicked soul burst out into a loud laughter. And it
came to pass that Kaikeyi previously urged by Kichaka, and moved by
affection for her brother, and desirous of doing him a good turn,
despatched me to him, saying "Do thou, O Sairindhri, fetch wine
from Kichaka's quarters!" On beholding me the Suta's son at first
addressed me in sweet words, and when that failed, he became
exceedingly enraged, and intended to use violence. Understanding
the purpose of the wicked Kichaka, I speedily rushed towards the
place where the king was. Felling me on the ground the wretch then
kicked me in the very presence of the king himself and before the
eyes of Kanka and many others, including charioteers, and royal
favourites, and elephant-riders, and citizens. I rebuked the king
and Kanka again and again. The king, however, neither prevented
Kichaka, nor inflicted any chastisement on him. The principal ally
of king Virata in war, the cruel Kichaka reft of virtue is loved by
both the king and the queen. O exalted one, brave, proud, sinful,
adulterous, and engrossed in all objects of enjoyment, he earneth
immense wealth (from the king), and robs the possessions of others
even if they cry in distress. And he never walketh in the path of
virtue, nor doth he any virtuous act. Of wicked soul, and vicious
disposition, haughty and villainous, and always afflicted by the
shafts of Kama, though repulsed repeatedly, if he sees me again, he
will outrage me. I shall then surely renounce my life. Although
striving to acquire virtue (on my death) your highly meritorious
acts will come to naught. Ye that are now obeying your pledge, ye
will lose your wife. By protecting one's wife one's offspring are
protected, and by protecting one's offspring, one's own self is
protected. And it is because one begets one's own self in one's
wife that the wife is called <i>Jaya</i><sup>15</sup> by the
wise. The husband also should be protected by the wife,
thinking,?<i>How else will he take his birth in my
womb</i>??I have heard it from Brahmanas expounding the
duties of the several orders that a Kshatriya hath no other duty
than subduing enemies. Alas, Kichaka kicked me in the very presence
of Yudhishthira the Just, and also of thyself, O Bhimasena of
mighty strength. It was thou, O Bhima, that didst deliver me from
the terrible Jatasura. It was thou also that with thy brothers
didst vanquish Jayadratha. Do thou now slay this wretch also who
hath insulted me. Presuming upon his being a favourite of the king,
Kichaka, O Bharata, hath enhanced my woe. Do thou, therefore, smash
this lustful wight even like an earthen pot dashed upon a stone.
If, O Bharata, tomorrow's sun sheds his rays upon him who is the
source of many griefs of mine, I shall, surely, mixing poison (with
some drink), drink it up,?for I never shall yield to Kichaka.
Far better it were, O Bhima, that I should die before thee.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this, Krishna, hiding her
face in Bhima's breast began to weep. And Bhima, embracing her,
consoled her to the best of his power. And having abundantly
consoled that slender-waisted daughter of Drupada by means of words
fraught with grave reason and sense, he wiped with his hands her
face flooded with tears. And thinking of Kichaka and licking with
his tongue the corners of his mouth, Bhima, filled with wrath thus
spake to that distressed lady."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXII</h2>
<p>"Bhima said, 'I will, O timid one, do even as thou sayest. I
will presently slay Kichaka with all his friends. O Yajnaseni of
sweet smiles, tomorrow evening, renouncing sorrow and grief, manage
to have a meeting with Kichaka. The dancing-hall that the king of
the Matsya hath caused to be erected is used by the girls for
dancing during the day. They repair, however, to their homes at
night. There in that hall, is an excellent and well-placed wooden
bed-stead. Even there I will make him see the spirits of his
deceased grandsires. But, O beautiful one, when thou holdest
converse with him, thou must manage it so that others may not espy
thee.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Having thus conversed with others, and
shed tears in grief, they waited for the dawn of that night with
painful impatience. And when the night had passed away, Kichaka,
rising in the morning, went to the palace, and accosted Draupadi
saying, 'Throwing thee down in the court I kicked thee in the
presence of the king. Attacked by mighty self, thou couldst not
obtain protection. This Virata is in name only the king of the
Matsyas. Commanding the forces of this realm it is I, who am the
real lord of the Matsyas. Do thou, O timid one, accept me
cheerfully. I shall become thy slave. And, O thou of graceful hips,
I will immediately give thee a hundred <i>nishkas</i>, and engage a
hundred male and a hundred female servants (to tend thee), and will
also bestow on thee cars yoked with she-mules. O timid lady, let
our union take place.' Draupadi replied, 'O Kichaka, know even this
is my condition. Neither thy friends nor thy brothers should know
thy union with me. I am a terror of detection by those illustrious
Gandharvas. Promise me this, and I yield to thee.' Hearing this
Kichaka said, 'I will, O thou of graceful hips, do even as thou
sayest. Afflicted by the god of love, I will, O beauteous damsel,
alone repair to thy abode for union with thee, O thou of thighs
round and tapering like the trunks of the plantain,?so that
those Gandharvas, effulgent as the sun, may not come to know of
this act of thine.' Draupadi said, 'Do thou, when it is dark, go to
the dancing-hall erected by the king of the Matsyas where the girls
dance during the day, repairing to their respective homes at night.
The Gandharvas do not know that place. We shall then without doubt,
escape all censure.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Reflecting on the subject of her
conversation with Kichaka, that half a day seemed to Krishna as
long as a whole month. And the stupid Kichaka also, not knowing
that it was Death that had assumed the form of a <i>Sairindhri</i>,
returning home experienced the greatest delight. And deprived of
sense by lust, Kichaka became speedily engaged in embellishing his
person with unguents and garlands and ornaments. And while he was
doing all this, thinking of that damsel of large eyes, the day
seemed to him to be without an end. And the beauty of Kichaka, who
was about to forsake his beauty for ever, seemed to heighten, like
the wick of a burning lamp about to expire. And reposing the
fullest confidence in Draupadi, Kichaka, deprived of his senses by
lust and absorbed in the contemplation of expected meeting, did not
even perceive that the day had departed. Meanwhile, the beautiful
Draupadi approaching her husband Bhima of the Kuru race, stood
before him in the kitchen. And that lady with tresses ending in
beautiful curls then spake unto him, saying, 'O chastiser of foes,
even as thou hadst directed, I have given Kichaka to understand
that our meeting will take place in the dancing-hall. Alone will he
come at night to the empty hall. Slay him there, O thou of mighty
arms. Do thou, O son of Kunti, repair to that dancing-hall, and
take the life, O Pandava, of Kichaka, that son of a <i>Suta</i>
intoxicated with vanity. From vanity alone, that son of a
<i>Suta</i> slights the Gandharvas. O best of smiters, lift him up
from the earth even as Krishna had lifted up the <i>Naga</i>
(Kaliya) from the Yamuna. O Pandava, afflicted as I am with grief,
wipe thou my tears, and blessed be thou, protect thy own honour and
that of thy race.'</p><br>
<p>"Bhima said, 'Welcome, O beauteous lady. Except the glad tidings
thou bringest me, I need, O thou of exceeding beauty, no other aid
whatever. The delight that I feel, O thou of great beauty, on
hearing from thee about my coming encounter with Kichaka, is equal
to what I felt in slaying Hidimva. I swear unto thee by Truth, by
my brothers, and by morality, that I will slay Kichaka even as the
lord of the celestials slew Vritra. Whether secretly or openly, I
will crush Kichaka, and if the Matsyas fight for him, then I will
slay them too. And slaying Duryodhana afterwards, I shall win back
the earth. Let Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, continue to pay
homage unto the king of Matsya.' Hearing these words of Bhima,
Draupadi said, 'In order that, O lord, thou mayst not have to
renounce the truth already pledged to me, do thou, O hero, slay
Kichaka in secret.' Bhima assuring her said, 'Even today I shall
slay Kichaka together with his friends unknown to others during the
darkness of the night. I shall, O faultless lady, crush, even as an
elephant crusheth a <i>vela</i> fruit,<sup>16</sup> the
head of the wicked Kichaka who wisheth for what is unattainable by
him!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Repairing first to the place of
assignation at night, Bhima sat down, disguising himself. And he
waited there in expectation of Kichaka, like a lion lying in wait
for a deer. And Kichaka, having embellished his person as he chose,
came to the dancing-hall at the appointed time in the hope of
meeting Panchali. And thinking of the assignation, he entered the
chamber. And having entered that hall enveloped in deep gloom, that
wretch of wicked soul came upon Bhima of incomparable prowess, who
had come a little before and who was waiting in a corner. And as an
insect approacheth towards a flaming fire, or a puny animal towards
a lion, Kichaka approached Bhima, lying down in a bed and burning
in anger at the thought of the insult offered to Krishna, as if he
were the Suta's Death. And having approached Bhima, Kichaka
possessed by lust, and his heart and soul filled with ecstacy
smilingly said, 'O thou of pencilled eye-brows, to thee I have
already given many and various kinds of wealth from the stores
earned by me, as well as hundred maids and many fine robes, and
also a mansion with an inner apartment adorned with beauteous and
lovely and youthful maid servants and embellished by every kind of
sports and amusements. And having set all those apart for thee, I
have speedily come hither. And all on a sudden, women have begun to
praise me, saying, <i>There is not in this world any other person
like unto thee in beauty and dress</i>!' Hearing this, Bhima said,
'It is well that thou art handsome, and it is well thou praisest
thyself. I think, however, that thou hadst never before this such
pleasurable touch! Thou hast an acute touch, and knowest the ways
of gallantry. Skilled in the art of love-making, thou art a
favourite with women. There is none like thee in this world!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Saying this, that son of Kunti, the
mighty-armed Bhima of terrible prowess, suddenly rose up, and
laughingly said, 'Thy sister, O wretch, shall today behold thee
dragged by me to the ground, like a mighty elephant, huge as a
mountain, dragged to the ground by a lion. Thyself slain
<i>Sairindhri</i> will live in peace, and we, her husbands, will
also live in peace.' Saying this, the mighty Bhima seized Kichaka
by the hairs of his head, which were adorned with garlands. And
thus seized with force by the hair, that foremost of mighty
persons, Kichaka, quickly freed his hair and grasped the arms of
Bhima. And then between those lions among men, fired with wrath,
between that chief of the Kichaka clan, and that best of men, there
ensued a hand-to-hand encounter, like that between two powerful
elephants for a female elephant in the season of spring, or like
that which happened in days of yore between those lions among
monkeys, the brothers Vali and Sugriva. And both equally infuriate
and both eager for victory, both those combatants raised their arms
resembling snakes furnished with five hoods, and attacked each
other with their nails and teeth, wrought up to frenzy of wrath.
Impetuously assailed by the powerful Kichaka in that encounter, the
resolute Bhima did not waver a single step. And locked in each
other's embraces and dragging each other, they fought on like two
mighty bulls. And having nails and teeth for their weapons, the
encounter between them was fierce and terrible like that of two
furious tigers. And felling each other in fury, they encountered
each other like a couple of elephants with rent temples. And the
mighty Bhima then seized Kichaka, and Kichaka, that foremost of
strong persons threw Bhima down with violence. And as those mighty
combatants fought on, the crash of their arms produced a loud noise
that resembled the clatter of splitting bamboos. Then Vrikodara
throwing Kichaka down by main force within the room, began to toss
him about furiously even as a hurricane tosseth a tree. And
attacked thus in battle by the powerful Bhima, Kichaka grew weak
and began to tremble. For all that, however, he tugged at the
Pandava to the best of his power. And attacking Bhima, and making
him wave a little, the mighty Kichaka struck him with his knees and
brought him down to the ground. And overthrown by the powerful
Kichaka, Bhima quickly rose up like Yama himself with mace in hand.
And thus that powerful <i>Suta</i> and the Pandava, intoxicated
with strength and challenging each other, grappled with each other
at midnight in that solitary place. And as they roared at each
other in wrath, that excellent and strong edifice began to shake
every moment. And slapped on the chest by the mighty Bhima, Kichaka
fired with wrath moved not a single pace. And bearing for a moment
only that onslaught incapable of being born on earth, the
<i>Suta</i>, overpowered by Bhima's might, became enfeebled. And
seeing him waning weak, Bhima endued with great strength forcibly
drew Kichaka towards his breast, and began to press hard. And
breathing hard again and again in wrath, that best of victors,
Vrikodara, forcibly seized Kichaka by the hair. And having seized
Kichaka, the mighty Bhima began to roar like a hungry tiger that
hath killed a large animal. And finding him exceedingly exhausted,
Vrikodara bound him fast with his arms, as one binds a beast with a
cord. And then Bhima began for a long while, to whirl the senseless
Kichaka, who began to roar frightfully like a broken trumpet.<sup>17</sup> And in order to pacify Krishna's
wrath Vrikodara grasped Kichaka's throat with his arms and began to
squeeze it. And assailing with his knees the waist of that worst of
the Kichakas, all the limbs of whose body had been broken into
fragments and whose eye-lids were closed, Vrikodara slew him, as
one would slay a beast. And beholding Kichaka entirely motionless,
the son of Pandu began to roll him about on the ground. And Bhima
then said, 'Slaying this wretch who intended to violate our
wife,?this thorn in the side of <i>Sairindhri</i>, I am freed
from the debt I owed to my brothers, and have attained perfect
peace.' And having said this, that foremost of men, with eyes red
in wrath, relinquished his hold of Kichaka, whose dress and
ornaments had been thrown off his person, whose eyes were rolling,
and whose body was yet trembling. And that foremost of mighty
persons, squeezing his own hands, and biting his lips in rage,
again attacked his adversary and thrust his arms and legs and neck
and head into his body like the wielder of the <i>Pinaka</i>
reducing into shapeless mass the deer, which form sacrifice had
assumed in order to escape his ire. And having crushed all his
limbs, and reduced him into a ball of flesh, the mighty Bhimasena
showed him unto Krishna. And endued with mighty energy that hero
then addressed Draupadi, that foremost of all women, saying, 'Come
princess of Panchala, and see what hath become of that lustful
wretch!' And saying this, Bhima of terrible prowess began to press
with his feet the body of that wicked wight. And lighting a torch
then and showing Draupadi the body of Kichaka, that hero addressed
her, saying, 'O thou of tresses ending in beautiful curls, those
that solicit thee, endued as thou art with an excellent disposition
and every virtue, will be slain by me even as this Kichaka hath
been, O timid one.' And having accomplished that difficult task so
highly agreeable to Krishna?having indeed slain Kichaka and
thereby pacified his wrath, Bhima bade farewell to Krishna, the
daughter of Drupada, and quickly went back to the kitchen. And
Draupadi also, that best of women, having caused Kichaka to be
slain had her grief removed and experienced the greatest delight.
And addressing the keepers of the dancing-hall, she said, 'Come ye
and behold Kichaka who had violated after other people's wives
lieth down here, slain by my Gandharva husbands.' And hearing these
words the guards of the dancing hall soon came by thousands to that
spot, torches in hand. And repairing to that room, they beheld the
lifeless Kichaka thrown on the ground, drenched with blood. And
beholding him without arms and legs, they were filled with grief.
And as they gazed at Kichaka, they were struck with amazement. And
seeing that superhuman act, viz., the overthrow of Kichaka, they
said, 'Where is his neck, and where are his legs?' And beholding
him in this plight they all concluded that he had been killed by a
Gandharva."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Then all the relatives of Kichaka, arriving
at that place, beheld him there and began to wail aloud,
surrounding him on all sides. And beholding Kichaka with every limb
mangled, and lying like a tortoise dragged to dry ground from the
water, all of them were overcome with exceeding fright, and the
bristles of their bodies stood on end. And seeing him crushed all
over by Bhima, like a Danava by Indra, they proceeded to take him
outside, for performing his funeral obsequies. And then those
persons of the <i>Suta</i> clan thus assembled together espied
Krishna of faultless limbs hard by, who stood reclining on a
pillar. And all the Kichakas assembled there, exclaimed, 'Let this
unchaste woman be slain for whom Kichaka hath himself lost his
life. Or, without slaying her here, let us cremate her with him
that had lusted after her,?for it behoveth us to accomplish
in every way what is agreeable to that deceased son of
<i>Suta</i>.' And then they addressed Virata, saying, 'It is for
her sake that Kichaka hath lost his life. Let him, therefore, be
cremated along with her. It behoveth thee to grant this
permission.' Thus addressed by them, king Virata, O monarch,
knowing fully well the prowess of the <i>Suta</i> gave his assent
to <i>Sairindhri</i> being burnt along with the <i>Suta's</i> son.
And at this, the Kichakas approaching the frightened and stupefied
Krishna of lotus-like eyes, seized her with violence. And binding
that damsel of slender waist and placing her upon the bier, they
set out with great energy towards the cemetery. And, O king, while
thus forcibly carried towards the cemetery by those sons of the
<i>Suta</i> tribe, the blameless and chaste Krishna living under
the protections of her lords, then wailed aloud for the help of her
husbands, saying, 'Oh, let Jaya, and Jayanta, and Vijaya and
Jayatsena, and Jayadvala listen to my words. The <i>Sutas</i> are
taking me away. Let those illustrious Gandharvas endued with speed
of hand, the clatter of whose cars is loud and the twang of whose
bowstrings in the midst of the mighty conflict are heard like the
roar of thunder, listen to my words,?the <i>Sutas</i> are
taking me away!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing those sorrowful words and
lamentations of Krishna, Bhima, without a moment's reflection
started up from his bed and said, 'I have heard, O
<i>Sairindhri</i> the words thou hast spoken. Thou hast, therefore,
O timid lady, no more fear at the hands of the <i>Sutas.</i>'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this, the mighty-armed
Bhima desirous of slaying the Kichakas, began to swell his body.
And carefully changing his attire, he went out of the palace by a
wrong egress. And climbing over a wall by the aid of a tree, he
proceeded towards the cemetery whither the Kichakas had gone. And
having leapt over the wall, and gone out of the excellent city,
Bhima impetuously rushed to where the <i>Sutas</i> were. And, O
monarch, proceeding towards the funeral pyre he beheld a large
tree, tall as palmyra-palm, with gigantic shoulders and withered
top. And that slayer of foes grasping with his arms that tree
measuring ten <i>Vyamas</i>, uprooted it, even like an elephant,
and placed it upon his shoulders. And taking up that tree with
trunk and branches and measuring ten <i>Vyamas</i>, that mighty
hero rushed towards the <i>Sutas</i>, like Yama himself, mace in
hand. And by the impetus of his rush<sup>18</sup> banians
and peepals and <i>Kinsukas</i> falling down on the earth lay in
clusters. And beholding that Gandharva approach them like a lion in
fury, all the <i>Sutas</i> trembling with fear and greatly
distressed, became panic-struck. And they addressed each other,
saying, 'Lo, the powerful Gandharva cometh hither, filled with
rage, and with an upraised tree in hand. Let <i>Sairindhri</i>,
therefore, from whom this danger of ours hath arisen, be set free.'
And beholding the tree that had been uprooted by Bhimasena, they
set Draupadi free and ran breathlessly towards the city. And seeing
them run away, Bhima, that mighty son of the Wind-god, despatched,
O foremost of kings, by means of that tree, a hundred and five of
them unto the abode of Yama, like the wielder of the thunderbolt
slaying the Danavas. And setting Draupadi free from her bonds, he
then, O king, comforted her. And that mighty-armed and
irrepressible Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, then addressed the
distressed princess of Panchala with face bathed in tears, saying,
'Thus, O timid one, are they slain that wrong thee without cause.
Return, O Krishna, to the city. Thou hast no longer any fear; I
myself will go to the Virata's kitchen by another route.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "It was thus, O Bharata, that a hundred
and five of those Kichakas were slain. And their corpses lay on the
ground, making the place look like a great forest overspread with
uprooted trees after a hurricane. Thus fell those hundred and five
Kichakas. And including Virata's general slain before, the
slaughtered Sutas numbered one hundred and six. And beholding that
exceedingly wonderful feat, men and women that assembled together,
were filled with astonishment. And the power of speech, O Bharata,
was suspended in every one."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXIV</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "And beholding the Sutas slain, the citizens
went to the king, and represented unto him what had happened,
saying, 'O king, those mighty sons of the Sutas have all been slain
by the Gandharvas. Indeed, they lie scattered on the earth like
huge peaks of mountains riven by thunder. <i>Sairindhri</i> also,
having been set free, returneth to thy palace in the city. Alas, O
king, if <i>Sairindhri</i> cometh, thy entire kingdom will be
endangered. <i>Sairindhri</i> is endued with great beauty; the
Gandharvas also are exceedingly powerful. Men again, without doubt,
are naturally sexual. Devise, therefore, O king, without delay,
such means that in consequence of wrongs done to <i>Sairindhri</i>,
thy kingdom may not meet with destruction.' Hearing those words of
theirs, Virata, that lord of hosts, said unto them, 'Do ye perform
the last rites of the Sutas. Let all the Kichakas be burnt, in one
blazing pyre with gems and fragrant unguents in profusion.' And
filled with fear, the king then addressed his queen Sudeshna,
saying, 'When <i>Sairindhri</i> comes back, do thou tell her these
words from me, "Blessed be thou, O fair-faced <i>Sairindhri</i>. Go
thou whithersoever thou likest. The king hath been alarmed, O thou
of graceful hips, at the defeat already experienced at the hands of
the Gandharvas. Protected as thou art by the Gandharvas, I dare not
personally say all this to thee. A woman, however, cannot offend,
and it is for this that I tell thee all this through a
woman."'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus delivered by Bhimasena after the
slaughter of the Sutas, the intelligent and youthful Krishna
relieved from all her fears, washed her limbs and clothes in water,
and proceeded towards the city, like a doe frightened by a tiger.
And beholding her, the citizens, O king, afflicted with the fear of
the Gandharvas fled in all directions. And some of them went so far
as to shut their eyes. And then, O king, at the gate of the
kitchen, the princess of Panchala saw Bhimasena staying, like an
infuriate elephant of gigantic proportions. And looking upon him
with wonder-expanded eyes, Draupadi, by means of words intelligible
to them alone, said, 'I bow unto that prince of the Gandharvas, who
hath rescued me.' At these words of her, Bhima said, 'Hearing these
words of hers in obedience to whom those persons were hitherto
living in the city, they will henceforth range here, regarding
themselves as freed from the debt.'"<sup>19</sup></p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Then she beheld the mighty-armed
Dhananjaya, in the dancing-hall instructing king Virata's daughters
in dancing. And issuing with Arjuna from the dancing-hall, all
those damsels came to Krishna who had arrived there, and who had
been persecuted so sorely, all innocent though she was. And they
said, 'By good luck also it is, O <i>Sairindhri</i>, that thou hast
been delivered from thy dangers. By good luck it is that thou hast
returned safe. And by good luck also it is that those Sutas have
been slain that had wronged thee, innocent though thou art.'
Hearing this, Vrihannala said, 'How hast thou, O <i>Sairindhri</i>,
been delivered? And how have those sinful wretches been slain? I
wish to learn all this from thee exactly as it occurred.'
<i>Sairindhri</i> replied, 'O blessed Vrihannala, always passing
thy days happily in the apartments of the girls, what concern hast
thou with <i>Sairindhri's</i> fate to say? Thou hast no grief to
bear that <i>Sairindhri</i> hath to bear! It is for this, that thou
askest me thus, distressed as I am in ridicule.' Thereat Vrihannala
said, 'O blessed one, Vrihannala also hath unparalleled sorrows of
her own. She hath become as low as a brute. Thou dost not, O girl,
understand this. I have lived with thee, and thou too hast lived
with us. When, therefore, thou art afflicted with misery, who is it
that will not, O thou of beautiful hips, feel it? But no one can
completely read another's heart. Therefore it is, O amiable one,
that thou knowest not my heart!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Then Draupadi, accompanied by those
girls entered the royal abode, desirous of appearing before
Sudeshna. And when she came before the queen, Virata's wife
addressed her at the command of the king, saying, 'Do thou, O
<i>Sairindhri</i>, speedily go whithersoever thou likest. The king,
good betide thee, hath been filled with fear at this discomfiture
at the hands of the Gandharvas. Thou art, O thou of graceful
eye-brows, young and unparalleled on earth in beauty. Thou art,
besides, an object of desire with men. The Gandharvas again, are
exceedingly wrathful.' Thereat <i>Sairindhri</i> said, 'O beauteous
lady, let the king suffer me to live here for only thirteen days
more. Without doubt, the Gandharvas also will be highly obliged at
this. They will then convey me hence and do what would be agreeable
to Virata. Without doubt, the king, by doing this, with his
friends, will reap great benefit.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXV</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "At the slaughter of Kichaka and brothers,
people, O king, thinking of this terrible feat, were filled with
surprise. And in the city and the provinces it was generally
bruited about that for bravery the king's Vallava and Kichaka were
both mighty warriors. The wicked Kichaka, however, had been an
oppressor of men and a dishonourer of other people's wives. And it
was for this that wicked of sinful soul had been slain by the
Gandharvas. And it was thus, O king, that people began to speak,
from province to province of the invincible Kichaka, that slayer of
hostile ranks.</p><br>
<p>"Meanwhile, the spies employed by Dhritarashtra's son, having
searched various villages and towns and kingdoms and done all that
they had been commanded to do and completed their examination, in
the manner directed, of the countries indicated in their orders,
returned to Nagarupa, gratified with at least one thing that they
had learnt.<sup>20</sup> And seeing Dhritarashtra's son king
Duryodhana of the Kuru race seated in his court with Drona and
Karna and Kripa, with the high-souled Bhishma, his own brothers,
and those great warriors?the Trigartas, they addressed him,
saying, 'O lord of men, great hath been the care always bestowed by
us in the search after the sons of Pandu in that mighty forest.
Searched have we through the solitary wilderness abounding with
deer and other animals and overgrown with trees and creepers of
diverse kind. Searched have we also in arbours of matted woods and
plants and creepers of every species, but we have failed in
discovering that track by which Pritha's son of irrepressible
energy may have gone. Searched have we in these and other places
for their foot-prints. Searched have we closely, O king, on
mountain tops and in inaccessible fastnesses, in various kingdoms
and provinces teeming with people, in encampments and cities. No
trace have yet been found of the sons of Pandu. Good betide thee, O
bull among men, it seems that they have perished without leaving a
mark behind. O foremost of warriors, although we followed in the
track of those warriors, yet, O best of men, we soon lost their
footprints and do not know their present residence. O lord of men,
for some time we followed in the wake of their charioteers. And
making our inquiries duly, we truly ascertained what we desired to
know. O slayer of foes, the charioteers reached Dwaravati without
the sons of Pritha among them. O king, neither the sons of Pandu,
nor the chaste Krishna, are in that city of Yadavas. O bull of the
Bharata race, we have not been able to discover either their track
or their present abode. Salutations to thee, they are gone for
good. We are acquainted with the disposition of the sons of Pandu
and know something of the feats achieved by them. It behoveth thee,
therefore, O lord of men, to give us instructions, O monarch, as to
what we should next do in the search after the sons of Pandu. O
hero, listen also to these agreeable words of ours, promising great
good to thee. King Matsya's commander, Kichaka of wicked soul, by
whom the Trigartas, O monarch, were repeatedly vanquished and slain
with mighty force, now lieth low on the ground with all his
brothers, slain, O monarch, by invisible Gandharvas during the
hours of darkness, O thou of unfading glory. Having heard this
delightful news about the discomfiture of our enemies, we have been
exceedingly gratified, O Kauravya. Do thou now ordain what should
next be done.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXVI</h2>
<h3>(<i>Go-harana Parva</i>)</h3>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Having listened to these words of his spies,
king Duryodhana reflected inwardly for some time and then addressed
his courtiers, saying, 'It is difficult to ascertain the course of
events definitely. Discern ye all, therefore, whither the sons of
Pandu have gone, of this thirteenth year which they are to pass
undiscovered by us all, the greater part hath already expired. What
remains is by much the smaller. If, indeed, the sons of Pandu can
pass undiscovered what remains of this year, devoted to the vow of
truth as they are, they will then have fulfilled their pledge. They
will then return like mighty elephants with temporal juice
trickling down, or like snakes of virulent poison. Filled with
wrath, they will, without doubt, be inflicters of terrible
chastisement on the Kurus. It behoveth ye, therefore, to make such
efforts without loss of time as may induce the sons of Pandu,
acquainted as they are with the proprieties of time, and staying as
they now are in painful disguise, to re-enter the woods suppressing
their rage. Indeed, adopt ye such means as may remove all causes of
quarrel and anxiety from the kingdom, making it tranquil and
foeless and incapable of sustaining a diminution of territory.'
Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Karna said, 'Let other spies,
abler and more cunning, and capable of accomplishing their object,
quickly go hence, O Bharata. Let them, well-disguised, wander
through swelling kingdoms and populous provinces, prying into
assemblies of the learned and delightful retreats of provinces. In
the inner apartments of palaces, in shrines and holy spots, in
mines and diverse other regions, the sons of Pandu should be
searched after with well-directed eagerness. Let the sons of Pandu
who are living in disguise be searched after by well-skilled spies
in large numbers, devoted to their work, themselves well-disguised,
and all well-acquainted with the objects of their search. Let the
search be made on the banks of rivers, in holy regions, in villages
and towns, in retreats of ascetics, in delightful mountains and
mountain-caves.' When Karna ceased, Duryodhana's second brother
Duhsasana, wedded to a sinful disposition, then addressed his
eldest brother and said, 'O monarch, O lord of men, let those spies
only in whom we have confidence, receiving their rewards in
advance, once more go after the search. This and what else hath
been said by Karna have our fullest approval. Let all the spies
engage themselves in the search according to the directions already
given. Let these and others engage in the search from province to
province according to approved rules. It is my belief, however,
that the track the Pandavas have followed or their present abode or
occupation will not be discovered. Perhaps, they are closely
concealed; perhaps, they have gone to the other side of the ocean.
Or, perhaps, proud as they are of their strength and courage, they
have been devoured by wild beasts; or perhaps, having been
overtaken by some unusual danger, they have perished for eternity.
Therefore, O prince of the Kuru race, dispelling all anxieties from
thy heart, achieve what thou wilt, always acting according to thy
energy.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXVII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Endued with mighty energy and possessed of
great discernment, Drona then said, 'Persons like the sons of Pandu
never perish nor undergo discomfiture. Brave and skilled in every
science, intelligent and with senses under control, virtuous and
grateful and obedient to the virtuous Yudhishthira, ever following
in the wake of their eldest brother who is conversant with the
conclusions of policy and virtue and profit, who is attached to
them as a father, and who strictly adhereth to virtue and is firm
in truth,?persons like them that are thus devoted to their
illustrious and royal brother, who gifted with great intelligence,
never injureth any body and who in his turn himself obeyeth his
younger brothers, never perish in this way. Why, then, should not
(Yudhishthira) the son of Pritha possessing a knowledge of policy,
be able to restore the prosperity of his brothers who are so
obedient and devoted and high-souled? It is for this that they are
carefully waiting for the arrival of their opportunity. Men such as
these never perish. This is what I see by my intellect. Do,
therefore, quickly and without loss of time, what should now be
done, after proper reflection. And let also the abode which the
sons of Pandu with souls under control as regards every purpose of
life, are to occupy, be now settled. Heroic and sinless and
possessed of ascetic merit, the Pandavas are difficult to be
discovered (within the period of non-discovery). Intelligent and
possessed of every virtue, devoted to truth and versed in the
principles of policy, endued with purity and holiness, and the
embodiment of immeasurable energy, the son of Pritha is capable of
consuming (his foes) by a glance alone of his eyes. Knowing all
this, do what is proper. Let us, therefore, once more search after
them, sending Brahmanas and <i>Charanas</i>, ascetics crowned with
success, and others of this kind who may have a knowledge of those
heroes!'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXVIII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Then that grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma
the son of Santanu, conversant with the <i>Vedas</i>, acquainted
with the proprieties of time and place, and possessing a knowledge
of every duty of morality, after the conclusion of Drona's speech,
applauded the words of the preceptor and spake unto the Bharatas
for their benefit these words consistent with virtue, expressive of
his attachment to the virtuous Yudhishthira, rarely spoken by men
that are dishonest, and always meeting with the approbation of the
honest. And the words that Bhishma spake were thoroughly impartial
and worshipped by the wise. And the grandsire of the Kurus said,
'The words that the regenerate Drona acquainted with the truth of
every affair hath uttered, are approved by me. I have no hesitation
in saying so. Endued with every auspicious mark, observant of
virtuous vows, possessed of Vedic lore, devoted to religious
observances, conversant with various sciences, obedient to the
counsels of the aged, adhering to the vow of truth, acquainted with
the proprieties of time, observant of the pledge they have given
(in respect of their exile), pure in their behaviour, ever adhering
to the duties of the Kshatriya order, always obedient to Kesava,
high-souled, possessed of great strength, and ever-bearing the
burthens of the wise, those heroic ones can never wither under
misfortune. Aided by their own energy, sons of Pandu who are now
leading a life of concealment in obedience to virtue, will surely
never perish. It is even this that my mind surmiseth. Therefore, O
Bharata, I am for employing the aid of honest counsel in our
behaviour towards the sons of Pandu. It would not be the policy of
any wise man to cause them to be discovered now by means of
spies,<sup>21</sup> what we should do unto the sons of
Pandu, I shall say, reflecting with the aid of the intellect. Know
that I shall say nothing from ill will to thee. People like me
should never give such counsels to him that is dishonest, for only
counsels (like those I would give) should be offered unto them that
are honest. Counsels, however, that are evil, should under no
circumstances be offered. He, O child, that is devoted to truth and
obedient to the aged, he, indeed, that is wise, while speaking in
the midst of an assembly, should under all circumstances speak the
truth, if the acquisition of virtue be an object with him. I
should, therefore, say that I think differently from all those
people here, in respect of the abode of Yudhishthira the just in
this the thirteenth year of his exile. The ruler, O child, of the
city or the province where king Yudhishthira resides cannot have
any misfortune. Charitable and liberal and humble and modest must
the people be of the country where king Yudhishthira resides.
Agreeable in speech, with passions under control, observant of
truth, cheerful, healthy, pure in conduct, and skilful in work must
the people be of the country where king Yudhishthira resides. The
people of the place, where Yudhishthira is, cannot be envious or
malicious, or vain, or proud, but must all adhere to their
respective duties. Indeed, in the place where Yudhishthira resides,
Vedic hymns will be chanted all around, sacrifices will be
performed, the last full libations will always be poured,<sup>22</sup> and gifts to Brahmanas will always
be in profusion. There the clouds, without doubt, pour abundant
rain, and furnished with good harvest the country will ever be
without fear. There the paddy will not be without grain, fruits
will not be bereft of juice, floral garlands will not be without
fragrance, and the conversation of men will always be full of
agreeable words. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the breezes
will be delicious, the meetings of men will always be friendly, and
cause of fear there will be none. There kine will be plentiful,
without any of them being lean-fleshed or weak, and milk and curds
and butter will all be savoury and nutritious. There where king
Yudhishthira resides, every kind of corn will be full of nutrition
and every edible full of flavour. There where king Yudhishthira
resides, the objects of all the senses, viz.,?taste, touch,
smell, and hearing, will be endued with excellent attributes. There
where king Yudhishthira resides, the sights and scenes will be
gladdening. And the regenerate ones of that place will be virtuous
and steady in observing their respective duties. Indeed, in the
country where the sons of Pandu may have taken up their abode
during this thirteenth year of their exile, the people will be
contented and cheerful, pure in conduct and without misery of any
kind. Devoted to gods and guests and the worship of these with
their whole soul, they will be fond of giving away, and filled with
great energy, they will all be observant of eternal virtue. There
where king Yudhishthira resides, the people, eschewing all that is
evil, will be desirous of achieving only what is good. Always
observant of sacrifices and pure vows, and hating untruth in
speech, the people of the place where king Yudhishthira may reside
will always be desirous of obtaining what is good, auspicious and
beneficial. There where Yudhishthira resides, the people will
certainly be desirous of achieving what is good, and their hearts
will always incline towards virtue, and their vows being agreeable
they themselves are ever-engaged in the acquisition of religious
merit. O child, that son of Pritha in whom are intelligence and
charity, the highest tranquillity and undoubted forgiveness,
modesty and prosperity, and fame and great energy and a love for
all creatures, is incapable of being found out (now that he hath
concealed himself) even by Brahmanas, let alone ordinary persons.
The wise Yudhishthira is living in close disguise in regions whose
characteristics I have described. Regarding his excellent mode of
life, I dare not say anything more. Reflecting well upon all this,
do without loss of time what thou mayst think to be beneficial, O
prince of the Kuru race, if indeed, thou hast any faith in
me.'"</p><br>

<p>Vaisampayana said, "Then Saradwata's son, Kripa said, 'What the
aged Bhishma hath said concerning the Pandavas is reasonable,
suited to the occasion, consistent with virtue and profit,
agreeable to the ear, fraught with sound reason, and worthy of him.
Listen also to what I would say on this subject. It behoveth thee
to ascertain the track they have followed and their abode also by
means of spies,<sup>23</sup> and to
adopt that policy which may bring about thy welfare. O child, he
that is solicitous of his welfare should not disregard even an
ordinary foe. What shall I say, then, O child, of the Pandavas who
are thorough masters of all weapons in battle. When, therefore, the
time cometh for the reappearance of the high-souled Pandavas, who,
having entered the forest,<sup>24</sup> are now
passing their days in close disguise, thou shouldst ascertain thy
strength both in thy own kingdom and in those of other kings.
Without doubt, the return of the Pandavas is at hand. When their
promised term of exile is over, the illustrious and mighty sons of
Pritha, endued with immeasurable prowess, will come hither bursting
with energy. Do thou, therefore, in order to conclude an
advantageous treaty with them, have recourse to sound policy and
address thyself to increase thy forces and improve thy treasury. O
child, ascertaining all these, reckon thou thy own strength in
respect of all thy allies weak and strong.<sup>25</sup>
Ascertaining the efficiency, and weakness, and indifference of thy
forces, as also who amongst them are well-affected and who are
disaffected, we should either fight the foe or make treaty with
him. Having recourse to the arts of conciliation, disunion,
chastisement, bribery, presents and fair behaviour, attack thy foes
and subdue the weak by might, and win over thy allies and troops
and by soft speeches. When thou hast (by these means) strengthened
thy army and filled thy treasury, entire success will be thine.
When thou hast done all this, thou wilt be able to fight with
powerful enemies that may present themselves, let alone the sons of
Pandu deficient in troops and animals of their own. By adopting all
these expedients according to the customs of thy order, thou wilt,
O foremost of men, attain enduring happiness in due time!'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXX</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Discomfited before, O monarch, many a time
and oft by Matsya's <i>Suta</i> Kichaka aided by the Matsyas and
the Salyas, the mighty king of the Trigartas, Susarman, who owned
innumerable cars, regarding the opportunity to be a favourable one,
then spoke the following words without losing a moment. And, O
monarch, forcibly vanquished along with his relatives by the mighty
Kichaka, king Susarman, eyeing Karna in askance, spoke these words
unto Duryodhana, 'My kingdom hath many a time been forcibly invaded
by the king of the Matsyas. The mighty Kichaka was that king's
generalissimo. Crooked and wrathful and of wicked soul, of prowess
famed over all the world, sinful in deeds and highly cruel, that
wretch, however, hath been slain by the Gandharvas. Kichaka being
dead, king Virata, shorn of pride and his refuge gone, will, I
imagine, lose all courage. I think we ought now to invade that
kingdom, if it pleases thee, O sinless one, as also the illustrious
Karna and all the Kauravas. The accident that hath happened is, I
imagine, a favourable one for us. Let us, therefore, repair to
Virata's kingdom abounding in corn. We will appropriate his gems
and other wealth of diverse kinds, and let us go to share with each
other as regards his villages and kingdom. Or, invading his city by
force, let us carry off by thousands his excellent kine of various
species. Uniting, O king, the forces of the Kauravas and the
Trigartas, let us lift his cattle in droves. Or, uniting our forces
well, we will check his power by forcing him to sue for peace. Or,
destroying his entire host, we will bring Matsya under subjection.
Having brought him under subjection by just means, we will live in
our kingdom happily, while thy power also will, without doubt, be
enhanced.' Hearing these words of Susarman, Karna addressed the
king, saying, 'Susarman hath spoken well; the opportunity is
favourable and promises to be profitable to us. Therefore, if it
pleases thee, O sinless one, let us, drawing up our forces in
battle array and marshalling them in divisions, speedily set out.
Or, let the expedition be managed as Saradwata's son Kripa, the
preceptor Drona, and the wise and aged grandsire of the Kurus may
think. Consulting with each other, let us, O lord of earth,
speedily set out to attain our end. What business have we with the
sons of Pandu, destitute as they are of wealth, might, and prowess?
They have either disappeared for good or have gone to the abode of
<i>Yama</i>. We will, O king, repair without anxiety to Virata's
city, and plunder his cattle and other wealth of diverse
kinds.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Accepting these words of Karna, the son
of Surya, king Duryodhana speedily commanded his brother Duhsasana,
born immediately after him and always obedient to his wishes,
saying, 'Consulting with the elders, array without delay, our
forces. We will with all the Kauravas go to the appointed place.
Let also the mighty warrior, king Susarman, accompanied by a
sufficient force with vehicles and animals, set out with the
Trigartas for the dominions of Matsyas. And let Susarman proceed
first, carefully concealing his intention. Following in their wake,
we will set out the day after in close array, for the prosperous
dominions of king Matsya. Let the Trigartas, however, suddenly
repair to the city of Virata, and coming upon the cowherds, seize
that immense wealth (of kine). We also marching in two divisions,
will seize thousands of excellent kine furnished with auspicious
marks.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Then, O Lord of earth, those warriors,
the Trigartas, accompanied by their infantry of terrible prowess,
marched towards the south-eastern direction, intending to wage
hostilities with Virata from the desire of seizing his kine. And
Susarman set out on the seventh day of the dark fortnight for
seizing the kine. And then, O king, on the eighth day following of
the dark fortnight, the Kauravas also accompanied by all their
troops, began to seize the kine by thousands."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXXI</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "O mighty king, entering into king Virata's
service, and dwelling in disguise in his excellent city, the
high-souled Pandavas of immeasurable prowess, completed the
promised period of non-discovery. And after Kichaka had been slain,
that slayer of hostile heroes, the mighty king Virata began to rest
his hopes on the sons of Kunti. And it was on the expiry of the
thirteenth year of their exile, O Bharata, that Susarman seized
Virata's cattle by thousands. And when the cattle had been seized,
the herdsman of Virata came with great speed to the city, and saw
his sovereign, the king of Matsyas, seated on the throne in the
midst of wise councillors, and those bulls among men, the sons of
Pandu, and surrounded by brave warriors decked with ear-rings and
bracelets. And appearing before that enhancer of his
dominion?King Virata seated in court?the herdsman bowed
down unto him, and addressed him, saying, 'O foremost of kings,
defeating and humiliating us in battle along with our friends the
Trigartas are seizing thy cattle by hundreds and by thousands. Do
thou, therefore, speedily rescue them. Oh, see that they are not
lost to thee.' Hearing these words, the king arrayed for battle the
Matsya force abounding in cars and elephants and horses and
infantry and standards. And kings and princes speedily put on, each
in its proper place,<sup>26</sup> their
shining and beautiful armour worthy of being worn by heroes. And
Virata's beloved brother, Satanika, put on a coat of mail made of
adamantine steel, adorned with burnished gold. And Madiraksha, next
in birth to Satanika, put on a strong coat of mail plated with
gold<sup>27</sup> and capable of resisting every
weapon. And the coat of mail that the king himself of the Matsyas
put on was invulnerable and decked with a hundred suns, a hundred
circles, a hundred spots, and a hundred eyes. And the coat of mail
that Suryadatta<sup>28</sup> put on
was bright as the sun, plated with gold, and broad as a hundred
lotuses of the fragrant (<i>Kahlara</i>) species. And the coat of
mail that Virata's eldest son, the heroic Sanksha, put on was
impenetrable and made of burnished steel, and decked with a hundred
eyes of gold. And it was thus that those god-like and mighty
warriors by hundreds, furnished with weapons, and eager for battle,
each donned his corselet. And then they yoked unto their excellent
cars of white-hue steeds equipped in mail. And then was
hoisted?Matsya's glorious standard on his excellent car
decked with gold and resembling the sun or the moon in its
effulgence. And other Kshatriya warriors also raised on their
respective cars gold-decked standards of various shapes and
devices. And king Matsya then addressed his brother Satanika born
immediately after him, saying, 'Kanka and Vallava and Tantripala
and Damagranthi of great energy will, as it appears to me fight,
without doubt. Give thou unto them cars furnished with banners and
let them case their persons in beautiful coats of mail that should
be both invulnerable and easy to wear. And let them also have
weapons. Bearing such martial forms and possessed of arms
resembling the trunk of mighty elephants, I can never persuade
myself that they cannot fight.' Hearing these words of the king,
Satanika, O monarch, immediately ordered cars for those sons of
Pritha, viz., the royal Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Nakula, and
Sahadeva, and commanded by the king, the charioteers, with cheerful
hearts and keeping loyalty in view, very soon got cars ready (for
the Pandavas). And those repressers of foes then donned those
beautiful coats of mail, invulnerable and easy to wear, that Virata
had ordered for those heroes of spotless fame. And mounted on cars
yoked with good steeds, those smiters of hostile ranks, those
foremost of men, the sons of Pritha, set out with cheerful hearts.
Indeed, those mighty warriors skilled in fight, those bulls of the
Kuru race and sons of Pandu, those four heroic brothers possessed
of prowess incapable of being baffled, mounting on cars decked with
gold, together set out, following Virata's wake. And infuriate
elephants of terrible mien, full sixty years of age, with shapely
tusks and rent temples and juice trickling down and looking (on
that account) like cloud pouring rain and mounted by trained
warriors skilled in fight, followed the king like unto moving
hills. And the principal warriors of Matsya who cheerfully followed
the king had eight thousand cars, a thousand elephants and sixty
thousand horses. And, O bull among the Bharatas, that force of
Virata, O king, as it marched forth marking the footprints of the
cattle looked exceedingly beautiful. And on its march that foremost
of armies owned by Virata, crowded with soldiers armed with strong
weapons, and abounding in elephants, horses and cars, looked really
splendid."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXXII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Marching out of the city, those heroic
smiters the Matsyas, arrayed in order of battle, overtook the
Trigartas when the sun had passed the meridian. And both excited to
fury and both desirous of having the king, the mighty Trigartas and
the Matsyas, irrepressible in battle, sent up loud roars. And then
the terrible and infuriate elephants ridden over by the skilful
combatants of both sides were urged on with spiked clubs and hooks.
And the encounter, O king, that took place when the sun was low in
the horizon, between the infantry and cavalry and chariots and
elephants of both parties, was like unto that of old between the
gods and the <i>Asuras</i>, terrible and fierce and sufficient for
making one's hair stand on end and calculated to increase the
population of Yama's kingdom. And as the combatants rushed against
one another, smiting and slashing, thick clouds of dust began to
rise, so that nothing could be discovered. And covered with the
dust raised by the contending armies, birds began to drop down on
the earth. And the sun himself disappeared behind the thick cloud
of arrows shot, and the firmament looked bright as if with myriads
of the fireflies. And shifting their bows, the staves of which were
decked with gold, from one hand to another, those heroes began to
strike each other down, discharging their arrows right and left.
And cars encountered cars, and foot-soldiers fought with
foot-soldiers, and horse-men with horsemen, and elephants with
mighty elephants. And they furiously encountered one another with
swords and axes, bearded darts and javelins, and iron clubs. And
although, O king, those mighty-armed warriors furiously assailed
one another in that conflict, yet neither party succeeded in
prevailing over the other. And severed heads, some with beautiful
noses, some with upper lips deeply gashed, some decked with
ear-rings, and some divided with wounds about the well-trimmed hair
were seen rolling on the ground covered with dust. And soon the
field of battle was overspread with the limbs of Kshatriya
warriors, cut off by means of arrows and lying like trunks of
<i>Sala</i> trees. And scattered over with heads decked in
ear-rings, and sandal-besmeared arms looking like the bodies of
snakes, the field of battle became exceedingly beautiful. And as
cars encountered cars, and horsemen encountered horsemen, and
foot-soldiers fought with foot-soldiers, and elephants met with
elephants, the frightful dust soon became drenched with torrents of
blood. And some amongst the combatants began to swoon away, and the
warriors began to fight reckless of consideration of humanity,
friendship and relationship. And both their course and sight
obstructed by the arrowy shower, vultures began to alight on the
ground. But although those strong-armed combatants furiously fought
with one another, yet the heroes of neither party succeeded in
routing their antagonists. And Satanika having slain a full hundred
of the enemy and Visalaksha full four hundred, both those mighty
warriors penetrated into the heart of the great Trigarta host. And
having entered into the thick of the Trigarta host, those famous
and mighty heroes began to deprive their antagonists of their
senses by causing a closer conflict to set in?a conflict, in
which the combatants seized one another by the hair and tore one
another with their nails.<sup>29</sup> And
eyeing the point where the cars of the Trigartas had been mustered
in strong numbers, those heroes at last directed their attack
towards it. And that foremost of car-warriors, king Virata also,
with Suryadatta in his van and Madiraksha in his rear, having
destroyed in that conflict five hundred cars, eight hundred horses,
and five warriors on great cars, displayed various skilful
manoeuvres on his car on that field of battle. And at last the king
came upon the ruler of the Trigartas mounted on a golden chariot.
And those high-souled and powerful warriors, desirous of fighting,
rushed roaring against each like two bulls in a cow-pen. Then that
bull among men, irrepressible in battle, Susarman, the king of the
Trigartas, challenged Matsya to a single combat on car. Then those
warriors excited to fury rushed against each other on their cars
and began to shower their arrows upon each other like clouds
pouring torrents of rain.<sup>30</sup> And
enraged with each other, those fierce warriors, both skilled in
weapons, both wielding swords and darts and maces, then moved about
(on the field of battle) assailing each other with whetted arrows.
Then king Virata pierced Susarman with ten shafts and each of his
four horses also with five shafts. And Susarman also, irresistible
in battle and conversant with fatal weapons, pierced king of Matsya
with fifty whetted shafts. And then, O mighty monarch, in
consequence of the dust on the field of battle, the soldiers of
both Susarman and Matsya's king could not distinguish one
another."</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXXIII</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Then, O Bharata, when the world was
enveloped in dust and the gloom of night, the warriors of both
sides, without breaking the order of battle, desisted for a
while.<sup>31</sup> And then, dispelling the darkness
the moon arose illumining the night and gladdening the hearts of
the Kshatriya warriors. And when everything became visible, the
battle once more began. And it raged on so furiously that the
combatants could not distinguish one another. And then Trigarta's
lord, Susarman with his younger brother, and accompanied by all his
cars, rushed towards the king of Matsya. And descending from their
cars, those bulls among Kshatriyas, the (royal) brothers, mace in
hand, rushed furiously towards the cars of the foe. And the hostile
hosts fiercely assailed each other with maces and swords and
scimitars, battle-axes and bearded darts with keen edges and points
of excellent temper. And king Susarman, the lord of the Trigartas
having by his energy oppressed and defeated the whole army of the
Matsyas, impetuously rushed towards Virata himself endued with
great energy. And the two brothers having severally slain Virata's
two steeds and his charioteer, as also those soldiers that
protected his rear, took him captive alive, when deprived of his
car. Then afflicting him sorely, like a lustful man afflicting a
defenceless damsel, Susarman placed Virata on his own car, and
speedily rushed out of the field. And when the powerful Virata,
deprived of his car, was taken captive, the Matsyas, harrassed
solely by the Trigartas, began to flee in fear in all directions.
And beholding them panic-stricken, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira,
addressed that subduer of foes, the mighty-armed Bhima, saying,
'The king of the Matsyas hath been taken by the Trigartas. Do thou,
O mighty-armed one, rescue him, so that he may not fall under the
power of the enemy. As we have lived happily in Virata's city,
having every desire of ours gratified, it behoveth thee, O
Bhimasena, to discharge that debt (by liberating the king).'
Thereat Bhimasena replied, 'I will liberate him, O king, at thy
command. Mark the feat I achieve (today) in battling with the foe,
relying solely on the might of my arms. Do thou, O king, stay
aside, along with our brothers and witness my prowess today.
Uprooting this mighty tree of huge trunk looking like a mace, I
will rout the enemy.'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Beholding Bhima casting his eyes on
that tree like a mad elephant, the heroic king Yudhishthira the
just spake unto his brother, saying, 'Do not, O Bhima, commit such
a rash act. Let the tree stand there. Thou must not achieve such
feats in a super-human manner by means of that tree, for if thou
dost, the people, O Bharata, will recognise thee and say, <i>This
is Bhima</i>. Take thou, therefore, some human weapon such as a bow
(and arrows), or a dart, or a sword, or a battle-axe. And taking
therefore, O Bhima, some weapon that is human, liberate thou the
king without giving anybody the means of knowing thee truly. The
twins endued with great strength will defend thy wheels. Fighting
together, O child, liberate the king of the Matsyas!'"</p><br>
<p>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, the mighty Bhimasena
endued with great speed, quickly took up an excellent bow and
impetuously shot from it a shower of arrows, thick as the downpour
of a rain-charged cloud. And Bhima then rushed furiously towards
Susarman of terrible deeds, and assuring Virata with the
words?<i>O good king!</i><sup>32</sup> said
unto the lord of the Trigartas,?<i>Stay! Stay!</i> Seeing
Bhima like unto Yama himself in his rear, saying, <i>Stay! Stay! Do
thou witness this mighty feat,?this combat that is at
hand!</i>?the bull among warriors, Susarman, seriously
considered (the situation), and taking up his bow turned back,
along with his brothers. Within the twinkling of an eye, Bhima
destroyed those cars that sought to oppose him. And soon again
hundreds of thousands of cars and elephants and horses and horsemen
and brave and fierce bowmen were overthrown by Bhima in the very
sight of Virata. And the hostile infantry also began to be
slaughtered by the illustrious Bhima, mace in hand. And beholding
that terrible onslaught, Susarman, irrepressible in fight, thought
within himself, 'My brother seems to have already succumbed in the
midst of his mighty host. Is my army going to be annihilated?' And
drawing his bow-string to his ear Susarman then turned back and
began to shoot keen-edged shafts incessantly. And seeing the
Pandavas return to the charge on their car, the Matsya warriors of
mighty host, urging on their steeds, shot excellent weapons for
grinding the Trigarta soldiers. And Virata's son also, exceedingly
exasperated began to perform prodigious fears of valour. And
Kunti's son Yudhishthira slew a thousand (of the foe), and Bhima
showed the abode of Yama unto seven thousand. And Nakula sent seven
hundred (to their last account) by means of his shafts. And
powerful Sahadeva also, commanded by Yudhishthira, slew three
hundred brave warriors. And having slain such numbers, that fierce
and mighty warrior, Yudhishthira, with weapons upraised, rushed
against Susarman. And rushing impetuously at Susarman, that
foremost of car-warriors, king Yudhishthira, assailed him with
vollies of shafts. And Susarman also, in great rage, quickly
pierced Yudhishthira with nine arrows, and each of his four steeds
with four arrows. Then, O king, Kunti's son Bhima of quick
movements, approaching Susarman crushed his steeds. And having
slain also those soldiers that protected his rear, he dragged from
the car his antagonist's charioteer to the ground. And seeing the
king of Trigarta's car without a driver, the defender of his
car-wheels, the famous and brave Madiraksha speedily came to his
aid. And thereat, leaping down from Susarman's car, and securing
the latter's mace the powerful Virata ran in pursuit of him. And
though old, he moved on the field, mace in hand, even like a lusty
youth. And beholding Susarman flee Bhima addressed him, saying,
'Desist, O Prince! This flight of thine is not proper! With this
prowess of thine, how couldst thou wish to carry off the cattle by
force? How also, forsaking thy follower, dost thou droop so amidst
foes?' Thus addressed by Pritha's son, the mighty Susarman, that
lord of countless cars saying unto Bhima, <i>Stay!
Stay!</i>?suddenly turned round and rushed at him. Then
Bhima, the son of Pandu, leaping down from his car, as he alone
could do,<sup>33</sup> rushed forward with great coolness,
desirous of taking Susarman's life. And desirous of seizing
Trigarta's king advancing towards him, the mighty Bhimasena rushed
impetuously towards him, even like a lion rushing at a small deer.
And advancing impetuously, the mighty-armed Bhima seized Susarman
by the hair, and lifting him up in wrath, dashed him down on the
ground. And as he lay crying in agony, the mighty-armed Bhima
kicked him at the head, and placing his knee on his breast dealt
him severe blows. And sorely afflicted with that kicking, the king
of Trigartas became senseless. And when the king of the Trigartas
deprived of his car, had been seized thus, the whole Trigarta army
stricken with panic, broke and fled in all directions, and the
mighty sons of Pandu, endued with modesty and observant of vows and
relying on the might of their own arms, after having vanquished
Susarman, and rescued the kine as well as other kinds of wealth and
having thus dispelled Virata's anxiety, stood together before that
monarch. And Bhimasena then said, 'This wretch given to wicked
deeds doth not deserve to escape me with life. But what can I do?
The king is so lenient!' And then taking Susarman by the neck as he
was lying on the ground insensible and covered with dust, and
binding him fast, Pritha's son Vrikodara placed him on his car, and
went to where Yudhishthira was staying in the midst of the field.
And Bhima then showed Susarman unto the monarch. And beholding
Susarman in that plight, that tiger among men king Yudhishthira
smilingly addressed Bhima?that ornament of
battle,?saying, 'Let this worst of men be set free.' Thus
addressed, Bhima spoke unto the mighty Susarman, saying, 'If, O
wretch, thou wishest to live, listen to those words of mine. Thou
must say in every court and assembly of men,?<i>I am a
slave.</i> On this condition only I will grant thee thy life.
Verily, this is the law about the vanquished.' Thereupon his elder
brother affectionately addressed Bhima, saying, 'If thou regardest
us as an authority, liberate this wicked wight. He hath already
become king Virata's slave.' And turning then to Susarman, he said,
'Thou art freed. Go thou a free man, and never act again in this
way.'"</p><br>
<h2>SECTION XXXIV</h2>
<p>Vaisampayana said, "Thus addressed by Yudhishthira Susarman was
overwhelmed with shame and hung down his head. And liberated (from
slavery), he went to king Virata, and having saluted the mona
